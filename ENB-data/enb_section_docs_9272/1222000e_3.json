      "COP 1 authorized the Chair of the AGBM to undertake consultations with the regional groups regarding the nominations for the Bureau of the AGBM.",
      "Discussion on the election of officers, other than the Chairman was initiated at the opening Plenary.",
      "Saudi Arabia said that not only was the issue of the bureau of the AGBM not resolved but that only a temporary bureau for COP 1 had been selected.",
      "The Chair said that this matter was referred to in paragraph 14 of the Report of COP 1 which states that the draft rules of procedures were being applied with the exception of rule 42 (voting) and that the Bureau should be considered as constituted without prejudice to the concerns of a number of delegations with regard to rule 22 (size of the Bureau).",
      "Throughout the week, the Chair conducted consultations with all five regional groups without resolution of the issue. On the fourth day of the AGBM, the Chair said that although regional consultations for the elections of officers were continuing, it appeared as if no decision could be made until AGBM 2.",
      "He noted that all the regional coordinators are aware of the various nuances of the situation and that some positions were strict but he preferred not to elaborate on this.",
      "In the final meeting of Plenary, the Chair pointed out that this matter remained unresolved and that he would continue to hold consultations and report on this during AGBM 2."
