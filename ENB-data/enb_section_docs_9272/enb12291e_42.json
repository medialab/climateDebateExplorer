      "On 28 November, Jane Hupe, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), briefed SBSTA on ICAO`s work on aviation emissions since SBSTA 22.",

      "These took place throughout the week and focused on whether to hold a workshop on this issue.",
      "However, on 6 December, Romero reported the lack of consensus to SBSTA and noted that bracketed text remained (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/CRP.1).",
      "The EU, South Africa, Japan, Australia, Chile, AOSIS and others supported holding a workshop, while Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya opposed this.",
      "Lacking consensus, SBSTA instead adopted brief conclusions forwarding the matter to SBSTA 24."
