      "Parties agreed to forward to the SBSTA, for consideration, draft conclusions and three draft decisions on: further guidance on safeguards information systems; guidance on non-market-based approaches; and guidance on non-carbon benefits. Contact group Co-Chair Robert Bamfo (Ghana) said these negotiations send a \"very positive signal\" for REDD+ implementation, with SBSTA Chair Lidia Wojtal adding they are a \"role model for negotiations.\" Many parties expressed appreciation for the conclusion of work on this agenda item, with PANAMA announcing she looked forward to focusing attention on ADP negotiations, and the EU noting that guidance on safeguards information systems could be improved."
