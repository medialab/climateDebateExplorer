      "On 28 July, Chair Patrick Sz\u00e9ll (UK) opened the fifth session of the Ad Hoc Group on Article 13 (AG13-5), the last AG13 meeting before COP3.",
      "He recalled that at AG13-4 some progress had been made, mainly due to the decision that AG13 should not aim to conclude its work before COP-4, pending a decision by the AGBM on the nature of the compliance regime. The Chair called attention to the draft Multilateral Consultative Process (MCP) (FCCC/AG13/1997/2, Annex II) containing proposals on functions and procedures with a number of bracketed references.",
      "He indicated that additional submissions by Switzerland and Uzbekistan had been circulated (FCCC/AG13/1 997/Misc.2). The Chair requested that delegations circulate amendments on the draft MCP immediately to allow for their consideration overnight.",
      "The Chair also outlined a draft decision he had prepared for COP-3 requesting provision for two more AG13 sessions, each lasting six half-days, with the aim of completing work by COP-4.",
      "Meeting the target date would not be guaranteed. On the scope and elements of an MCP, the Chair invited comments on the ordering of paragraphs in the MCP compilation text.",
      "The EU said the opening paragraph should refer to a 'process' as mandated by FCCC Article 13.",
      "Reference to the establishment of a committee should follow later.",
      "The US warned against getting ahead of COP-3 and added that he was not in a position to endorse any course of action for AG13.",
      "The Chair invited comments on the first paragraph of the MCP compilation.",
      "Parties discussed: the introduction of a reference to FCCC Article 13; whether the paragraph should refer only to the establishment of a committee or to a process with a subsequent paragraph on a committee, or both; whether such a committee should be 'standing' or 'ad hoc;' and whether a committee should report directly to the COP or to the SBI. On 29 July, delegates engaged in a paragraph-by-paragraph review of the draft compilation of proposals.",
      "Parties agreed on a reformulated introductory paragraph prepared by a working group chaired by Zimbabwe.",
      "The paragraph establishes the MCP as a set of procedures to be served by a committee.",
      "There was no agreement on whether the committee should be standing or ad hoc or whether it should be established under the SBI. On a paragraph that sets out objectives, the Chair noted an EU proposal, supported by SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA, to refer to the 'process' rather than the committee.",
      "The US, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed that the MCP provide Parties with advice on 'their' implementation of the Convention.",
      "The EU said Article 13 of the FCCC refers to advice on 'the' implementation. On related subparagraphs, there was no agreement on the objectives of promoting understanding of the Convention and preventing disputes.",
      "The Chair noted support from IRAN, CHILE and CHINA for the inclusion of the provision of assistance to Parties together with an EU suggestion that the committee advise other elements of the FCCC on providing financial and technological assistance. The Chair agreed to note IRAN`s proposal, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, to reformulate three subparagraphs to read: 'Providing [consultative] assistance to the Parties in need in order to facilitate implementation of the Convention and finding solutions to the possible problems in this regard.",
      "' The Chair noted that the question of providing assistance was likely to continue to haunt the Parties. AUSTRALIA and the US objected to a suggestion by SWITZERLAND, supported by FRANCE, that the objectives include a reference to a protocol.",
      "The Chair advised Parties to forget references to a protocol until next year. The Chair said a paragraph stating that the MCP will be separate from and without prejudice to the provisions of FCCC Article 14 (settlement of disputes) is based on wording from the Montreal Protocol.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA recalled that FCCC Article 13 is not a non-compliance procedure.",
      "The Chair invited Parties to ask whether the MCP`s relationship to the settlement of disputes in FCCC Article 14 arose at all, given its 'helpline' nature. Delegates also discussed a paragraph concerning the committee mandate.",
      "It was agreed that the title should be changed to 'Mandate of the Committee.",
      "' There was significant debate on provision of assistance to Parties, including proposals by CHINA, SWITZERLAND, the EU and the US.",
      "SWITZERLAND agreed to go along with the EU proposal that assistance should consist of advice and recommendations on technical and financial aspects.",
      "The remaining proposals will appear in the new compilation text.",
      "There was considerable debate on the role of the COP. On 30 July, AG13-5 considered the draft report to COP-3 (FCCC/AG13/1997/CRP.2).",
      "The draft report states that the establishment of any MCP must be within the framework of the FCCC.",
      "AG13`s next session will consider whether to adjust its framework draft text in light of the AGBM negotiations.",
      "Parties decided to hold two more sessions of six and eight meetings to complete work before COP-4.",
      "The entire framework text remains in brackets. In the introductory paragraph the options describing the MCP procedures as 'ad hoc' or 'standing' remain in brackets.",
      "Each of the proposals on objectives of the MCP, a new proposal on providing consultative assistance to Parties, and elements in the proposed Mandate of the Committee are also bracketed.",
      "Decisions have also been held over on questions of how issues will be taken up by the MCP, and whether one or more Parties will be involved in making submissions.",
      "In the Outcome section, a paragraph that would subject conclusions and recommendations from the MCP to the consent of the Party or Parties concerned remains in brackets. The EU, supported by CHILE, SAUDI ARABIA and SWITZERLAND called for at least two more AG13 sessions, each lasting eight half-days and, with KUWAIT and FRANCE, called for a stronger commitment to completion of work by COP-4.",
      "The US and CHINA did not agree.",
      "Chair Szell modified the draft decision for COP-3 (FCCC/AG13/1997/CRP.2 Annex III) to indicate that AG13 should continue beyond the COP, invite AG13 to complete its work by COP-4 and request it to report to COP-4 on progress if it fails to meet the target date.",
      "He also amended the draft report (Organizational Matters) to indicate that AG13 will require two further sessions each consisting of about six to eight meetings. Reviewing the draft compilation for a Multilateral Consultative Process (MCP) (Annex II), in a paragraph describing how issues are to be taken up, CHINA asked for the re-insertion of a reference, in brackets, to consideration of any submission made by 'a Party on its own request.",
      "' KUWAIT, CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA questioned the adequacy of a decision to cross-reference this procedural paragraph in an earlier paragraph on the Mandate of the Committee. Rapporteur Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia) presented the draft report of AG13-5 for adoption.",
      "The Chair noted that detailed discussions would be needed at AG13-6 on: assistance to Parties; the question of who can trigger proceedings; and the implications of COP-3."
