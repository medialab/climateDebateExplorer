      "This item was first taken on Friday, 20 May, when SBI considered a report on making UNFCCC meetings 'climate neutral' (FCCC/SBI/2005/9).",
      "The US and Saudi Arabia opposed a proposal to make UNFCCC meetings climate neutral, noting the heavy agenda of other pressing issues, and arguing that it was the prerogative of individual countries to decide on this when hosting UNFCCC meetings.",
      "In spite of support for the proposal from Micronesia and Trinidad and Tobago, the final draft conclusions do not propose making all UNFCCC meetings climate neutral, and instead refer only to Canada`s statement that it intends to make COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 climate neutral."
