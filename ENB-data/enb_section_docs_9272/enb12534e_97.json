      "During informal discussions facilitated by Georg B\u00f8rsting (Norway) and Suzanty Sitorus (Indonesia), parties focused on the Standing Committee of the financial mechanism of the Convention and on long-term finance.",
      "Several iterations of draft text on these items were considered.",
      "On the Standing Committee, parties considered whether it should be a subsidiary body of the Convention and make recommendations directly to the COP or whether it should report to the SBI.",
      "Functions of the Standing Committee regarding assistance to be provided to the COP were also addressed.",
      "Proposed functions include: improving coherence and coordination in the delivery of climate financing; developing recommendations to rationalize the financial mechanism; and MRV of support provided to developing countries.",
      "On long-term finance, parties made proposals for streamlining the text, with several parties cautioning against going back on what was agreed in Cancun in proposals presented, for example, on a burden sharing mechanism to identify the flows of financial support.",
      "However, parties agreed on an option whereby each country will determine the mode and source of its contributions in support of the goal of mobilizing US$100 billion.",
      "On capitalization of the GCF, some parties emphasized the need to clarify what was pledged in terms of long-term financing.",
      "Others said issues relating to the GCF were being considered elsewhere.",
      "Parties also exchanged views on the feasibility of convening workshops on sources of long-term finance including an annexed indicative schedule of activities on sources of long-term financing.",
      "They also addressed operational paragraphs on options for adequacy and predictability, and on continuity and scaling up of financing.",

      "Delegates also discussed whether public sources constitute the main funding source.",
      "During discussions on new and innovative sources of finance, a group of developed countries observed that it is premature to discuss the establishment of a mechanism to assess the incidence of sources of finance.",
      "On bunker fuels, they proposed language noting that alternative sources such as carbon pricing of global aviation and maritime transportation have the potential to generate significant funds and will also generate the price signal necessary to achieve emission reductions in these sectors and inviting IMO and ICAO to develop instruments including market-based instruments.",
      "Other developed countries preferred to delete all the paragraphs relating to incidence."
