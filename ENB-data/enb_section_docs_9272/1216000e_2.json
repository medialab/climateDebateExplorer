      "Bo Kjellen (Sweden) convened the first consultations on the adequacy of commitments on Friday morning.",
      "Since there were no formal meetings in session, Room 7 was the place to be and drew a standing-room-only crowd.",
      "Although the large number of delegates was not conducive to drafting, delegates were able to further exchange views on possible elements of a mandate for consultations on commitments.",
      "At 3:00 pm, Kjellen met with the heads of the regional and interest groups to discuss how to proceed on this matter and at 4:30 pm, the consultations reconvened.",
      "By the end of the afternoon, it was clear that no progress could be made.",
      "The Chair requested that the G-77 and China meet and reconsider its position and report back at the next meeting. The G-77 and China met on Saturday afternoon to discuss its position.",
      "By 4:30 pm it appeared as though there was a deadlock and it was proposed that the G-77 meeting adjourn and that a meeting of 'like minded States' be convened in its place.",
      "The like-minded States meeting proved to be productive and the group tabled its proposed elements of a mandate for consultations on commitments when Kjellen's group reconvened Saturday evening.",
      "This text was greeted with cautious optimism.",
      "The group was scheduled to reconvene on Sunday afternoon."
