      "The conclusions on P&Ms (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.10) request the SBSTA Chair to organize intersessional consultations back-to-back with SBSTA-17 to exchange views on the initial results from activities undertaken on 'good and best practices' in P&Ms.",
      "They agree on a frame for defining Annex I Parties` further steps in implementing decision 13/CP.7.",
      "The frame will include three elements: general information sharing; information sharing in specific areas encompassing all relevant sectors and cross- cutting and methodological issues; and information from relevant international and intergovernmental organizations. The conclusions also invite relevant organizations, including the IPCC, to present status reports at SBSTA-17 and future sessions.",
      "Finally, they invite Parties to submit views on elements for consideration of initial results and the 'frame' for defining further steps, and agree to consider further steps at SBSTA-17."
