   "sentences": [
      "On Tuesday, 28 March 1995, Executive- Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar introduced the documentation on designation of a Permanent Secretariat and arrangements for its functioning (FCCC/CP/1995/5 and its three addenda).",
      "He gave particular attention to the following five areas where action is needed by the COP: institutional linkages between the Convention Secretariat and the United Nations; financial procedures; physical location of the Convention Secretariat; the Convention budget for the biennium 1996-1997; and extrabudgetary funding for 1995. Uruguay said the Interim Secretariat's budget estimates did not reflect differences in potential operating costs based on the proposals for the location of the Permanent Secretariat, which should be taken into account.",
      "He suggested that the estimates include more than the transfer costs of locating the Permanent Secretariat, and added that he could not support the sections on Uruguay in the Interim Secretariat's documents.",
      "India was willing to adopt the indicative scale of contributions outlined in the Interim Secretariat's document and asked whether proposed consultations had occurred between the countries offering to host the Permanent Secretariat.",
      "Canada said the budget figures Uruguay mentioned had not been distributed, but should be as soon as possible. The Executive-Secretary responded that the cost figures referred to by Uruguay appeared only in a draft document and could be improved upon in any final document.",
      "Comparisons by location of staff costs, the major element of Secretariat expenses, were based on standard UN figures, not surveys of local costs.",
      "He said he had not been informed of any consultations between countries proposing to host the Permanent Secretariat.",
      "He also noted that FCCC/CP/1995/Misc.3, a letter from Canada, was the only new information received since INC-11.",
      "At the conclusion of the discussion, the Chair announced that a drafting group, chaired by Mahmoud Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania) would be formed to consider the budget. Budget: The drafting group on the budget met several times during the first week before beginning a programme-by- programme review of the budget on Friday evening.",
      "During the two-hour meeting, some OECD countries called for reductions in the budget and asked the Secretariat to provide the group with new figures on Saturday evening.",
      "The drafting group completed the first phase of its work on Monday, 4 April 1995.",
      "When El Ghaouth presented the draft decision documents to the COW the following day, he noted that some of the figures would have to be changed once the location of the Permanent Secretariat was known.",
      "The COW then recommended the following draft decisions for adoption by COP-1: the Convention budget for the biennium 1996-1997 (FCCC/CP/1995/L.4); Extrabudgetary funding for the interim secretariat for 1995 (FCCC/CP/1995/L.7); and Other voluntary funding for the biennium 1996-1997 (FCCC/CP/1995/L.8).",
      "At the suggestion of France, a footnote was added to L.4 explaining that the working capital reserve amounted to 8.3% of the operating budget, equivalent to one month's budget. Once the decision was taken to move the Secretariat to Bonn, the drafting group on the budget met once again to revise certain figures.",
      "Although the Executive-Secretary of the Interim Secretariat noted that some costs would only be determined after further consultations with the German Government, the COP approved the Convention budget for the biennium 1996-1997, amounting to US$18,664,200. Financial Procedures: On Friday, 31 March 1995, the Chair introduced FCCC/CP/1995/L.2, a draft decision on financial procedures for the Permanent Secretariat.",
      "The Chair also introduced document FCCC/CP/1995/ 5/Add.1/Rev.1, containing the indicative scale of contributions from Parties to the administrative budget.",
      "Delegations then asked specific questions regarding the computation of contributions and percentages.",
      "Mauritania raised the possibility of annexing the financial rules to the proposed text.",
      "Uruguay asked whether the COP would recommend suspending voting rights for Parties that do not meet their contributions.",
      "The Chair said there are no sanctions mentioned in the basic documents for non-payment of contributions.",
      "Japan joined the consensus on contributions, but added that his delegation interprets these contributions as voluntary.",
      "The Committee then agreed to recommend the adoption of L.2 to the Plenary. FCCC/CP/1995/L.2/Rev.1, which was adopted by the Plenary at its final session, also includes a full text of the financial procedures for the COP, its subsidiary bodies and the secretariat in Annex I and the indicative scale of contributions to the administrative budget of the Convention for the biennium 1996-1997 in Annex II.",
      "It also decides that any countries becoming Parties during the remainder of 1995 shall contribute to the expenses of the Convention, and requests that all Parties be advised of their contributions no later than 22 December 1995. Institutional Linkages: On Saturday, 1 April 1995, the Chair introduced FCCC/CP/1995/L.3 on the institutional linkages between the Permanent Secretariat and the United Nations.",
      "He summarized the decision's substantive provisions including that the Secretariat be linked but not fully integrated with UN programmes, the arrangement be reviewed by 31 December 1999, a request that the General Assembly pay conference- servicing costs for future COPs and meetings of subsidiary bodies from the UN regular programme budget, and that the Interim Secretariat inform the Secretary-General of the estimated financial implications for 1996 and 1997.",
      "The document, which was later amended to reflect recommendations received from the UN Secretary-General, was forwarded for adoption by the Plenary. Location of the Permanent Secretariat: Amb.",
      "Estrada held consultations on the location of the Permanent Secretariat during the first week of COP-1.",
      "On Monday, 3 April 1995, Estrada reported that no consensus was yet apparent.",
      "Various means had been considered, including an informal confidential survey of delegations' preferences by secret ballot.",
      "He said the original agreement was that a decision would be taken at Berlin and preferably prior to the ministerial session, but one of the four candidate delegations disagreed.",
      "He said he recognized that the general feeling of the house was to take a decision at COP- 1.",
      "Canada said its understanding was that there is no consensus on this point.",
      "The Chair said he would wait for Canada to support his proposal. On Tuesday, Estrada proposed an 'informal survey' where each Party would indicate its preference on a piece of paper prepared for this purpose and place this paper in a box.",
      "Any paper with more than one mark or no marks would be considered invalid.",
      "If one city received the 'absolute majority' it would be proposed for a consensus solution.",
      "If not, there would be a second round with three cities and, if necessary, a third round with two cities.",
      "Estrada then noted that budget implications and the need to establish a Secretariat without doubts about administrative arrangements made a decision imperative. Canada disagreed that this was the appropriate time to decide.",
      "He said that INC-11's intent was for COP-1 to select a candidate city only if there was consensus.",
      "He urged delegates to consider using the survey later at a neutral site.",
      "Switzerland said it was not the time politically to pursue these consultations and that it would also be a bad UN precedent.",
      "The decision should be made on neutral ground, possibly at the CSD meeting in New York.",
      "The US said he was persuaded by the Canadian and Swiss concerns. Italy, supported by Poland, said he was impressed by the Chair's suggestion, and that Article 8.3 of the Convention says COP-1 should designate a Permanent Secretariat.",
      "Germany said now is an appropriate time to take a decision.",
      "Nigeria, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Mali, Trinidad and Tobago, Togo, Cape Verde, Niger, Mauritius and Djibouti supported the Chair's proposal.",
      "Burkina Faso said that COP-1 should take the decision, but the question should be put before the Ministerial Segment. Canada said Article 8.3 did not require COP-1 to decide on the location.",
      "He called for a substantive discussion, including budget figures comparing costs for the four locations.",
      "The Chair said the figures had been presented in consultations on the Convention budget, and participating delegations have had an opportunity to review them.",
      "The Chair said deferring the decision by a few weeks would be expensive and complicated.",
      "He said it was the feeling of the house that delegates should proceed, notwithstanding the reluctance of two candidates and some other delegations.",
      "He emphasized that the survey was not a decision or a vote. Canada said that regardless of what it was called, the Chair was proposing a decision mechanism by majority vote.",
      "Canada noted his country's offer to contribute an additional $1 million (Canadian) for five years to the Secretariat budget.",
      "Canada also distributed budget figures for staff and travel that showed Toronto costs to be 54% of Geneva, 67% of Montevideo and 70% of Bonn for 1996-1997.",
      "Switzerland said he was pleased to see his supporters backing a quick decision and that there was progress on the Chair's proposal.",
      "The US said it would not hold up progress.",
      "Uruguay agreed that a decision should be made at Berlin. The first round of the survey was completed at 4:00 pm on Tuesday.",
      "No city received a majority and Uruguay withdrew its offer to host the Secretariat in Montevideo.",
      "The second round of the survey was completed at 7:00 pm that evening.",
      "When all of the secret ballots were counted there was still no majority and Estrada announced that the third round would take place on Wednesday and the choice would be between Bonn and Geneva.",
      "Canada then withdrew its offer to host the Secretariat in Toronto.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon the tension built and the press gathered.",
      "Finally, Estrada announced that the Parties participating in the informal survey had selected Bonn as the seat of the Permanent Secretariat.",
      "The COW adopted decision FCCC/CP/1995/L.12 on the location of the Permanent Secretariat in Bonn on Thursday night, 6 April 1995."
