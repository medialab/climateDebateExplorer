      "George Manful, Head of the Capacity Building/GEF Unit with the UNFCCC Implementation Programme, spoke on technology transfer and national communications.",
      "He indicated that 80 initial non-Annex I national communications had been received as of 18 April 2002.",
      "Commenting on the content of the initial communications, he said technology transfer issues had been referred to only in a 'very superficial' manner, and that these references related mainly to mitigation rather than adaptation projects.",
      "Issues mentioned in the communications, but not elaborated on in any detail, included the cost of technologies, barriers to technology transfer, institutional and technical capacities, and the availability of information.",
      "He also drew attention to the work of the Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I communications and to the revised guidelines for preparing national communications adopted at COP-7."
