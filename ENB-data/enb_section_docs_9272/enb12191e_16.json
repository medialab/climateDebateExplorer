      "In the ensuing discussion, a number of participants asked for clarification on various details of the handbook, and several speakers stressed that the handbook should complement other relevant work, rather than duplicate it.",
      "Responding to questions about the timing of the handbook, Rob Gross stressed that technology needs assessment is not a 'once-and-for-all process' and will have to be revisited periodically.",
      "Yamil Bonduki added that, although some countries are too far along the current process to use the handbook for their needs assessments, many others are not, and will therefore be able to benefit from it.",
      "He responded to one participant`s concern that the handbook might focus on mitigation by indicating that this was not the case, adding that mitigation analysis experiences will be useful for adaptation work. One speaker called for an inventory of technologies, which she said could provide recommendations based on the circumstances of the type of country reviewing the technology options.",
      "A developed country participant said technology needs assessments should not just establish what technology to use for a specific project, but could also contribute to the development of a wider national technology policy."
