      "IPCC Chair Robert Watson opened the seventeenth Panel session on Wednesday morning, 4 April.",
      "After welcoming participants, he highlighted the importance of the meeting, and said it would accept the actions taken by the three IPCC Working Groups with regard to the Third Assessment Report (TAR).",
      "He noted that each section of the TAR had already been approved by each respective Working Group.",
      "He then said the meeting would discuss the future of the IPCC.",
      "He asked participants to first consider whether there should be a future role for the IPCC, and if so, what the scope and the structure of the IPCC should be.",
      "He introduced a paper he had written on this issue, which would form the basis for in-depth discussions during the meeting.",
      "He said participants would consider whether the IPCC was being responsive to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and other entities in the environment and development field.",
      "He then noted that the draft Synthesis Report of the TAR would be distributed during the meeting.",
      "He said that it had been sent out to governments for review, was being translated into all six UN languages, and would be approved by the eighteenth IPCC Plenary session, to be held in London, United Kingdom, in September 2001. Godwin Obasi, Secretary-General of the WMO, thanked UNEP for hosting the meeting.",
      "He recalled achievements of the IPCC to date and provided his perspective of the TAR.",
      "He said the TAR: was more definitive in attributing most observed climate change to human activities; called attention to trends in climate variables in addition to temperature; noted that ecosystems and human systems are vulnerable to climate change, with the poor likely to be most hard hit; showed that climate change mitigation policies have potential synergies with policies that promote sustainable development and equity; and noted that human actions influence the future climate of the planet.",
      "He called for action to address the challenge of climate change under the UNFCCC.",
      "He also noted the importance of collection, distribution, exchange and archiving of information related to the global climate, and the need for resources in order to reverse the decline in observational networks and to improve climate modeling.",
      "On the future work of the IPCC, he suggested that the Panel should consider converting the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories into a working group.",
      "He assured the support of the WMO for the IPCC. Klaus T\u00f6pfer, Executive Director of UNEP, welcomed participants to Nairobi.",
      "He congratulated the IPCC on its work, and emphasized the importance of its continuation.",
      "He highlighted a decision from the UNEP Governing Council meeting held in Nairobi from 5-9 February 2001, which urged the continuation of support for the IPCC and the participation of as many experts as possible from developing countries, and which called for UNEP to disseminate the findings of the TAR.",
      "He recalled the key message of Working Group I, that new and stronger evidence is available to indicate that the warming that has been observed could be attributed to human activities.",
      "He noted that Working Group II indicated that carefully planned adaptation measures could significantly reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "He underscored that in this manner the IPCC does not only identify the problems, but also provides guidance toward solutions.",
      "He said Working Group III demonstrated the importance of focusing on bottlenecks in order to overcome them.",
      "He concluded that scientific, not politically biased, views should be the outcome of the work of the IPCC. Michael Zammit Cutajar, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, made his last statement to the Plenary of the IPCC in his current capacity.",
      "He underscored that the three assessment reports and the special reports are the 'bible of climate science,' and noted that the work of the IPCC provides hope that all governments will recognize the importance of climate change.",
      "He outlined his recommendations that the future work of the IPCC should: maintain the rhythm of publication of the assessment reports every five years and the current format for reporting; ensure integration of scientific assessments with environment and development issues and cooperation between conventions; and explore ways to better communicate the information to governments and the general public.",
      "He confirmed that the resumed session of the UNFCCC Sixth Conference of the Parties (COP-6) would be held from16-27 July 2001.",
      "He noted his wish that the IPCC would be able to identify a scientifically sound indicator of climate change that world public opinion would immediately grasp. Renate Christ, Deputy Secretary of the IPCC, on behalf of the IPCC Secretariat, thanked UNEP for the hosting this meeting.",
      "Participants then adopted the provisional annotated agenda."
