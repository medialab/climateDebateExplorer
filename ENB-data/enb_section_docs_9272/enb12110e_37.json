      "The EU believes it has held the line on the central debate over the work programme on LULUCF.",
      "They think the JUSCANZ group attempted to develop a parallel process and speed up the work timetable to preempt the forthcoming IPCC Special Report.",
      "At the same time, some JUSCANZ Parties demonstrated a reluctance to provide timely and important data in Protocol Articles 3.3 and 3.4 (QELROs), which would assist the IPCC in assessing the implications of future decisions on the inclusion of certain activities under the LULUCF provisions.",
      "The negotiations therefore seemed to confirm NGO suspicions that methodological debates are being used to erode Annex B commitments.",

      "Virtually no action would be needed by Annex B Parties to 'meet' the commitments."
