      "Good practice guidance for LULUCF activities under the Protocol, harvested wood products (HWP) and other issues relating to LULUCF: This issue was first addressed in the SBSTA plenary on Monday, 6 December, and subsequently in a contact group co-chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana), which met five times from 6-13 December.",
      "Informal consultations were also held in an effort to draft conclusions and negotiate a draft decision for adoption at COP-10.",
      "On Tuesday, 14 December, SBSTA adopted conclusions on this matter and on Friday, 17 December, the COP adopted the decision, including a draft COP/MOP decision The contact group addressed the IPCC good practice guidance (GPG) under the Protocol, the issue of harvested wood products, and other matters relating to LULUCF.",
      "At SBSTA-20, delegates had not been able to reach agreement on, inter alia, the methods for accounting GPG, while the common reporting format tables had been agreed on, except with regard to the identification of LULUCF activities in relation to Protocol Article 6 (JI) and the coding system to be used for identifying activities in relation to JI projects. In the first meeting of the contact group, Co-Chair Rosland, supported by the EU, Canada and Japan, and opposed by the G-77/China, proposed removing all brackets in the draft negotiating text forwarded from SBSTA-20 and deleting the option on the common reporting format referring to Protocol Article 6.",
      "Following informal consultations, Parties agreed on a revised draft decision text that stipulates that GPG will be applied in a manner 'consistent' with the Marrakesh Accords, and includes a footnote stating that reporting methods contained in the GPG should ensure that land areas subject to LULUCF activities under Articles 3.3 (afforestation, reforestation and deforestation) and 3.4 (additional activities) can be identified. On HWP, Parties could not agree on how the IPCC should develop methods to estimate, measure and report on HWP in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. On LULUCF matters, Australia, supported by Canada and Japan, tabled a written proposal for an open-ended policy dialogue.",
      "Australia, with the US, Canada and the EU, and opposed by the G-77/China and AOSIS, supported addressing the issue of 'factoring out' direct human-induced effects from the indirect and natural effects of LULUCF activities.",
      "Parties did not reach consensus on this matter, but agreed on a paragraph relating to the possible application of biome-specific forest definitions. On Tuesday 14 December, SBSTA adopted conclusions on GPG, HWP and other LULUCF issues and forwarded a draft decision on GPG to the COP, including a draft COP/MOP decision.",
      "The conclusions were adopted by the COP on Friday, 17 December."
