      "Co-Chair Philip Gwage asked delegates to comment on an Argentine proposal to adopt a work programme on adaptation.",
      "Describing the proposal, ARGENTINA proposed to adopt a substantive decision on adaptation, and outlined elements for a work programme on adaptation that seeks to, inter alia, address the domestic measures that Parties should take to adapt to climate change and climate variability.",
      "He identified a list of elements for future work on: data and methodologies; vulnerability assessment; adaptation planning; integration of adaptation into sustainable development; and adaptation actions. The EU said the roles of SBSTA, SBI and the COP should be clarified.",
      "She also said that this agenda item should not focus on adaptation only, but should include aspects of impacts and vulnerability as well.",
      "MICRONESIA said that adaptation actions are key, and expressed concern that the proposed time-frame to conduct assessments during 2005-9 is too long, considering the urgency of the matter.",
      "JAPAN said that adaptation is an important issue but expressed concern over the discussions underway on decision 5/CP.7.",
      "He stressed that consistency should be kept between decisions on both agenda items. SUDAN, on behalf of the Africa Group, supported the proposal and said the SBSTA-21 in-session workshop results should be included.",
      "SOUTH AFRICA underscored that it is important to have a work programme on this issue, and to put existing knowledge to use.",
      "CHINA, supported by SOUTH AFRICA and ARGENTINA, said that most of the proposed actions should be adopted by States and that the Argentine proposal could be included in the draft decision requesting SBSTA to organize an in-session workshop on these issues. ARGENTINA said that his country`s proposal sought to address adaptation in a substantive manner and to provide a clear political, scientific and technological framework for action.",
      "He emphasized that the proposal includes only the scientific aspects of adaptation, as there had been no consensus on SBI and SBSTA working together on this matter. The US commended the Argentine proposal but preferred to postpone making a decision until discussions on the implementation of decision 5/CP.7 conclude, to prevent overlaps.",
      "PERU considered implementation of decision 5/CP.7 a prerequisite for the type of assessment outlined in the Argentine proposal.",
      "AUSTRALIA, supported by the EU, noted that the proposal establishes a framework for a programme of work, and that the programme itself and its detailed activities could be adopted at a later stage.",
      "Discussions continued into the night."
