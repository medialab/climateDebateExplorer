      "The afternoon event was facilitated by Jamie Peters (YOUNGOs).",
      "Participants focused on: how the 2015 agreement could foster enhanced collaboration between non-state actors and governments; and the role the UNFCCC could play in recognizing and strengthening non-state actors' initiatives and actions.",
      "The Secretariat invited participants to address how non-states' actor initiatives can catalyze, foster, facilitate and inspire the UNFCCC process. ADP Co-Chairs reacted to comments from the floor on: the need for preparatory work with various constituencies to build domestic political momentum by spreading information about benefits in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy and green growth; and perspectives on how equity and fairness could inform the 2015 agreement.",
      "Participants also discussed, inter alia : recognition of the role of non-state actors; a just transition for trade unions; the role of private climate finance; human rights-based approach; inter-generational equity; and the role of women in sustainable agriculture and land use."
