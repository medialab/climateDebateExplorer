      "George Manful, Programme Officer, Implementation Programme, UNFCCC Secretariat, discussed education, training and networking.",
      "He remarked that reporting on this issue was varied and that drawing a distinction between ongoing activities and those that are yet to be implemented is difficult.",
      "On education, he noted some success in integrating climate change issues into educational programmes, particularly at the university level.",
      "On training, he remarked that training scientific, technical, and managerial personnel is critical to implementing the UNFCCC, but that the focus and magnitude of existing training programmes is unclear.",
      "He explained that training activities were an important part of preparing national communications, and that training a critical mass of experts would give Parties the capacity to initiate climate change projects.",
      "He noted the need for more financial support. In the ensuing discussion, one delegate suggested that a universal set of education and training materials be created and translated into various national languages.",
      "Participants agreed that such materials could be useful if adapted to address national circumstances."
