      "As the ADP train slowly moved on, the interactive approach promoted by the Co-Chairs produced intermittent progress in the contact group discussions on finance.",
      "While a number of delegates stuck to reiterating familiar positions, some expressed appreciation to the US for their 'surprisingly progressive' position and Norway's proposal on readiness support.",
