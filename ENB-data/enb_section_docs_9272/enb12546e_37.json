      "Decision (2/CP.17) requested the SBSTA to consider issues related to agriculture with the aim of adopting a decision at COP 18.",
      "This issue (FCCC/SBSTA/2012/MISC.6 and Adds.1-2) was first considered by the SBSTA on 14 May.",
      "Chair Muyungi subsequently facilitated informal consultations.",
      "Throughout the informal consultations, many parties referred to their submissions, highlighting the need to, inter alia: ensure that work on agriculture is consistent with the SBSTA mandate in Convention Article 9 (the scope of technical, scientific and methodological work); assess existing scientific and technological knowledge on agriculture and climate change; increase knowledge sharing; enhance information on knowledge gaps; improve agricultural productivity and resilience in the context of climate change; and improve capacity building in developing countries.",
      "Many developing countries underscored the importance of adaptation and its relative priority compared to mitigation.",
      "They also highlighted the need to achieve food security and the importance of technology transfer.",
      "Some countries called for a dialogue on how to facilitate, inter alia , technology transfer and innovation.",
      "Others called for a work programme to move the process forward.",
      "A developing country suggested workshops as a useful way forward.",
      "A developed country noted the need to learn more from external bodies and organizations, such as the IPCC.",
      "Another developed country highlighted the need to recognize the site-specific nature of agriculture.",
      "On the draft conclusions, parties views diverged on, inter alia : language regarding the aim of the assessment of the current state of scientific knowledge and whether to reference a workshop (FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/CRP.2) and a technical paper (FCCC/TP/2008/8) on opportunities and challenges from mitigation in the agricultural sector.",
      "Bolivia, for the G-77/China, objected to the absence of language on adaptation, with the Philippines adding that the word was profusely used in previous discussions.",
      "The US expressed support for addressing adaptation concerns, but objected to limiting the focus of work on this issue.",
      "No agreement was reached."
