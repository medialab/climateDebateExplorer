      "On the roster of experts, the EU noted that Parties should be requested to review the information on the current roster and submit additional nominations to the Secretariat, particularly of experts with backgrounds related to the economic and financial aspects of transfer of technology and know-how.",
      "With regard to the issue of Intergovernmental Technical Advisory Panels (ITAPs), she pointed out that until now SBSTA had not been able to establish the panels, mainly because of difficulties in agreeing on a structure.",
      "She said the structure should facilitate a flexible and effective approach and indicated that a number of small working groups could be established to deal with SBSTA's scientific and methodological issues.",
      "The G-77/CHINA reiterated that the establishment of ITAPs is central to SBSTA's work, particularly on technology transfer and know-how. Regarding procedural problems encountered in using the roster, the US stated that they would not be solved by establishing permanent standing bodies.",
      "He said it was premature to take a decision on ITAPs and encouraged better use of the roster through increased participation by experts.",
      "On the EU proposal, the US said nothing precluded putting it into effect right away. JAPAN and ZIMBABWE agreed that although a useful tool, the roster lacked geographical balance, perhaps due to inadequate dissemination of information on the roster in certain regions.",
      "MALAYSIA and INDIA noted an emerging consensus that some of the issues needed to be studied by groups of experts. Delegates considered the activities of Parties included in Annex II related to transfer of technology (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/13) and the report on technology information centers (CRP.3).",
      "The US said the report demonstrates the extensive amount of work underway, but noted that many countries cannot provide the information required by the guidelines.",
      "The EU called upon non-Annex I countries to report on their technology needs and, with MALAYSIA, supported the Secretariat's proposal to revise the guidelines.",
      "SRI LANKA said that SBSTA's actions should reflect the spirit of language adopted at UNGASS on transfer of environmentally sound technology. Delegates also discussed a progress report on the development and transfer of technologies (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/10); a technical paper on adaptation technologies (FCCC/TP/1997/3) and a Climate Technology Initiative (CTI) survey of information centers. JAPAN highlighted recent CTI national and regional workshops and, with the EU, noted the need to make the best use of existing institutions and programmes.",
      "The EU also stressed the importance of the technological needs survey for non-Annex I Parties and urged Annex I Parties to provide information on any related surveys. Some developing countries described difficulties in identifying adaptation technology and responding to questionnaires and surveys.",
      "They said it was difficult to identify their own technological needs and suggested a study.",
      "INDIA described its recent technological advances, including electronic networking systems and regional research centers.",
      "MALAYSIA said the Secretariat should promote decision-making tools and develop a technology information center.",
      "The US said technology is key to solving the climate change threat and creating the right investment climate to attract financing is critical to resolving the technology transfer issue. On methodologies, the Chair noted that the AGBM had requested recommendations for estimating emissions and sinks and using Greenhouse Warming Potentials (GWPs).",
      "He suggested that the Secretariat draft a text based on previous SBSTA decisions and conclusions.",
      "The US proposed focusing on uncertainties in sources and sinks.",
      "He said the consideration of GWPs should include their technical and legal legitimacy and which time horizon to use. The Secretariat introduced the document on methodological issues (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/9) and a technical paper on temperature adjustments and Parties' actions (FCCC/TP/1997/2).",
      "The EU said individual Parties should choose whether and how to apply adjustments, but should describe their approaches in detail.",
      "Parties should report inventories without adjustments.",
      "The US said careful construction of baselines and targets compensates for temperature and other fluctuations.",
      "Multi-year averaging compensates for short-term fluctuations and requires no adjustments. TANZANIA presented a draft decision that calls on SBSTA to identify gaps developing countries face in research and development of methodologies, monitoring and assessment capacity, and observational networks.",
      "It calls on SBI to eliminate the gaps and provide financial and technical support."
