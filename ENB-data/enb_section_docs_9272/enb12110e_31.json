      "There was a genuine sense of disappointment among negotiators during the first week and a half of the subsidiary bodies` proceedings, stemming largely from the G-77/China`s need to take time to complete its internal discussions on issues such as the Protocol mechanisms and compliance.",
      "The heavy technical and procedural focus of the agenda was dominated by the schedule set out in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, which, because of its generous timelines, allows Parties to defer consideration of substantive issues, at least for the time being.",
      "This, combined with the efforts of some Parties to postpone contentious issues beyond the upcoming COP, added to a distinct absence of any sense of occasion.",
      "Little surprise that SBI Chair Kante described the meetings as 'technical' and predicted that COP-5 would see more of the same. Post-Kyoto negotiations will continue to witness a slowing down in pace for a number of reasons, aside from the need to resolve issues trapped in invisible brackets.",
      "First, the new phase in negotiations is undertaking the work of institutionalizing the outcomes from Kyoto, a task that should not be underestimated in its complexity.",
      "The workload to tackle the complexity of issues derived from Kyoto Protocol was reflected in discussions on the programme budget for the 2000-2001 biennium.",
      "In its original proposal, the Secretariat foresaw a 50% increase with respect to the budget for the previous biennium.",
      "Although Parties did not agree to an increase of this nature, they did acknowledge the added burdens derived from pending Kyoto Protocol issues. While there will be a temptation to criticize the apparent slowing-down in the pace of developments, it is to be expected and may, in retrospect, come to be viewed as a welcome signal of a routinization of the process.",
      "Another reason is that, however effective the negotiating process, progress on design and implementation of far-reaching instruments such as the Kyoto mechanisms should not outpace the ability of those Parties with low capacity to absorb and calculate the likely impact and opportunities for their respective countries and regions.",
      "The G-77/China is entitled to argue for all the time it requires to engage effectively in the negotiations, not in the least because their futures and the future of global equity are once more intimately bound up with decision-making in the ecologically- indebted industrialized countries.",
      "Finally, the inexorable penetration of the FCCC and Kyoto Protocol`s impact on domestic policy and constituencies will influence negotiations, adding new calculations to be taken on board during international negotiations.",
      "The upcoming US Presidential election is only one prominent example of the domestic-international interaction that must be factored into the negotiations by all concerned."
