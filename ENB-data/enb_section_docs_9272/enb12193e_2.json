      "On the agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/1 and Add.1), Chair Thorgeirsson noted a request to add an item on Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects) to the agendas of both subsidiary bodies.",
      "The EU recalled that decision 5/CP.7 addresses Article 2.3.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA said Parties had agreed that decisions on Protocol and UNFCCC issues would be kept separate.",
      "With the G-77/CHINA and opposed by the EU, JAPAN, and AUSTRALIA, he supported inserting this agenda item. On a proposal by Canada on cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy, the G-77/CHINA said the item was incorrectly worded on the provisional agenda, and it should refer to the report of the workshop on this issue, not to a proposal.",
      "CANADA said the provisional agenda correctly referred to a proposal and, supported by several Annex I Parties and UZBEKISTAN, but opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and the G-77/CHINA, stressed retaining the issue as worded in the provisional agenda. Following consultations, Parties agreed with the Chair`s proposal that the agenda items on clean energy and on Article 2.3 be held in abeyance.",
      "Chair Thorgeirsson said further consultations would be carried out on the agenda, and the results reported back next week.",
      "SBSTA then adopted the modified agenda."
