      "At 11:55 am Monday, 23 July, delegates reconvened in a Plenary session of the COP.",
      "President Pronk reported that intense negotiations had been undertaken throughout the night on the section on compliance, and had concluded around 10:00 am. He introduced the draft decision resulting from negotiations, which is contained in two informal papers entitled 'core elements for the implementation of the BAPA.",
      "' The first, dated 21 July, was distributed Saturday night (see Pronk's 'core elements' proposal on page one).",
      "The second, dated 23 July, contains the revised text on compliance.",
      "The compliance text was amended in three key areas: consequences to be applied by the enforcement branch shall aim at ensuring 'environmental integrity' rather than 'reparation of damage to the environment'; the stipulation that payments be made to 'repair damage to the environment' is deleted; and COP-6 adopts the compliance regime and recommends to COP/MOP-1 the adoption, in terms of Article 18 (compliance), of procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance. Commenting on the draft decision, President Pronk noted that some legal and technical points will also have to be cleared up in the text.",
      "He then proposed that the COP approve the draft decision on the understanding that the formal adoption will follow at its next Plenary meeting when the text has been issued as an official conference paper.",
      "The COP adopted the decision, with a standing ovation. Thanking all delegates and staff for their cooperative spirit and devotion to reach a result, President Pronk said this result was necessary not just for the climate but to underline the value of multilateral negotiations within the framework of the UN. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar thanked President Pronk, all the Parties, the UNFCCC Secretariat and his colleagues from the wider UN family, for giving him 'such a bright and hopeful moment.",
      "' In general statements, many Parties expressed satisfaction at the adoption of the decision.",
      "IRAN, for the G-77/CHINA, said this was an 'honorable deal' that represents a historic achievement and 'the triumph of multilateral negotiations over unilateralism.",
      "' The EU said the agreement was historic and, with the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, stressed that it was very positive for the international community.",
      "He said the door had been left open for a country that considers that the Protocol is not the best tool to address climate change, to join at a later stage.",
      "He then read the text of a Political Declaration submitted by the EU, Canada, Iceland, Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland on funding to developing countries, which includes an engagement to provide an annual contribution of US$ 410 million by 2005. AUSTRALIA said the Umbrella Group would meet its responsibilities.",
      "CANADA announced that it would allocate ten million dollars to jump-start the fund to help meet the adaptation needs of LDCs.",
      "CHINA thanked the EU and others for their Political Declaration and said the agreement had demonstrated that, in times of crisis, the international community continues to move in the right direction.",
      "JAPAN expressed pleasure in joining the consensus that constitutes a vital step towards realizing the entry into force of the Protocol by 2002.",
      "She added that a global effort is needed to achieve the Protocol's objectives.",
      "CG-11 said individual members promised to do their best to engage the Protocol ratification process and hoped the 'skeptical' country would join the global endeavor. The US noted that the COP recognizes a segregation between funding under the UNFCCC and the Protocol.",
      "She added that the fact that the US did not seek to block consensus did not change her country's view that the Protocol is 'not sound policy.",
      "' The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said that although his country is not currently able to join in financial assistance to developing countries, he thinks it will be able to do so sometime in the future.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA said that, in spite of some concerns, it had agreed to join the consensus.",
      "The meeting closed at 2:05 pm."
