      "In its conclusions (FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/L.2), the AWG, among other things: agrees that the flexible mechanisms under the Protocol should continue to be available to Annex I parties as means to meet their emission reduction targets and could be appropriately improved; notes that, in considering possible improvements to the mechanisms, due attention should be paid to promoting, inter alia, the environmental integrity of the Protocol and the contribution to sustainable development; notes that the use of the flexible mechanisms should be supplemental to the implementation of domestic actions at the disposal of Annex I parties; agrees that measures related to LULUCF activities should continue to be available to Annex I parties; notes that some of the definitions, modalities, rules and guidelines relating to LULUCF activities, contained in the annex to decision 16/CMP.1, apply only to the first commitment period; acknowledges that further discussions on this issue should take into account the principles that govern the treatment of LULUCF, as set out in decision 16/CMP.1; acknowledges that the choice and effective use, in accordance with agreed rules and relevant decisions under the Protocol where they apply, of means that may be available to Annex I parties to reach their emission reduction targets depend on national circumstances and the international context; notes that the AWG will continue work on the analysis of means that may be available to Annex I parties to reach their emission reduction targets; and notes that the AWG will require the participation of experts and should take into account relevant results achieved and work underway in other bodies and processes under the Convention and Protocol.",
      "The AWG also agrees to consider, at the resumed AWG 5 and the first part of AWG 6, with due attention to improving the environmental integrity of the Protocol, issues related to: the flexible mechanisms, including possible improvements; the treatment of LULUCF in the second commitment period; sectoral approaches; possible broadening of the coverage of GHGs, sectors and source categories and its implications, based on sound science; and how approaches to limit or reduce bunker fuel emissions could be used by Annex I parties as a means to reach their emission reduction targets, taking into account Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol.",
      "It agrees to consider implications for the carbon market resulting from changes to the means that may be available to Annex I parties to reach their emission reduction targets.",
      "The AWG conclusions also include an annex containing a summary report of the AWG Chair and Vice-Chair on the workshop discussions."
