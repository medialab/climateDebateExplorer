      "Chair Sok Appadu invited delegates to present views on compromise text proposed by the EU following informal consultations, and proposals from the G-77/China, the US and Saudi Arabia.",
      "The EU proposal requests non-Annex I Parties to submit funding proposals for national communications even in advance of substantial completion of previous national communications, but not later than one year after the submission of their previous national communications.",
      "BRAZIL, for the G-77/China, expressed concern about the one-year deadline. Responding to a proposal by Chair Appadu calling on non-Annex I Parties to submit national communications every four years, the G-77/CHINA said that while some Group members had considered six years to be a reasonable option, he did not have the mandate of the G-77/China to present this as a formal Group position. The proposals were compiled and bracketed, along with the EU proposal for a three-year cycle for national communications.",
      "Chair Appadu encouraged Parties to consult informally and present written text."
