      "The first part of the fourth session of the AWG opened on Monday morning, 27 August 2007, with Leon Charles (Grenada) continuing as the AWG Chair and Outi Bergh\u00e4ll (Finland) as the AWG Vice-Chair.",
      "AWG Chair Charles stressed the need for a strong robust outcome.",
      "He explained that the AWG will resume its fourth session in Bali and proposed that the Vienna meeting focus on the analysis of mitigation potentials and ranges of emission reduction objectives of Annex I parties.",
      "He indicated that this would leave the agenda item on the review of the work programme, methods of work and schedule of future sessions to be taken up at the AWG's resumed fourth session.",
      "Parties adopted the provisional agenda ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2007/3 ) without amendment, and agreed to the organization of the work.",
      "During the Monday morning plenary, country groups made opening statements.",
      "Australia, for the Umbrella Group, called for in-depth consideration of indicative ranges of emission reductions, including the contribution of Annex I parties.",
      "He added that the iterative nature of the AWG's work plan would allow parties to revisit issues and emphasized that the AWG is one of several inputs to the post-2012 issues.",
      "Pakistan, for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), stressed the unique vulnerability of least developed countries (LDCs), the African region, and small island developing states (SIDS).",
      "Portugal, for the European Union (EU), restated that global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions should be reduced by 50% by 2050 to ensure that the average temperature increase is no more than 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.",
      "Switzerland, for the Environmental Integrity Group, recalled recent findings by the IPCC and called for strengthened mitigation and adaptation efforts, taking account of the circumstances of small states.",
      "Maldives, for the LDCs, and Grenada, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), challenged a scenario projecting greenhouse gas concentrations of between 445-490 parts per million (ppm) and a change in global mean temperature above pre-industrial levels of between 2-2.4 \u00b0C.",
      "AOSIS said the avoidance of climate change impacts in small island states should be a benchmark for the post-2012 agreement.",
      "Indonesia called for real progress on the analysis of mitigation potentials and ranges of emission reductions.",
      "She also outlined plans for COP 13, including parallel meetings for finance and trade ministers."
