      "In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2007/L.27), SBI notes that countries with economies in transition still need support with regard to capacity building, and encourages entities in a position to do so, including the GEF, industrialized countries, and multilateral and bilateral agencies, to continue to provide such support.",
      "The SBI also invites submissions on these activities by February 2012, for review at SBI 36. PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 1/CP.10 (BUENOS AIRES PROGRAMME OF WORK ON ADAPTATION AND RESPONSE MEASURES): This issue was first addressed in SBI plenary on 4 December, and subsequently in contact group and informal meetings co-chaired by Shayleen Thompson (Australia) and Philip Gwage (Uganda).",
      "In light of a number of expert meetings and regional workshops mandated by COP 10, parties were to consider possible elements for further action in the area of adverse effects of climate change and the area of impacts of implementing response measures. SBI Chair Bagher Asadi presented text based on elements identified during SBI 26 discussions.",
      "While the US, Canada, the EU and others accepted the text as a good basis for discussion, the G-77/China felt it needed more details on implementation.",
      "However, the G-77/China did not have a common position on the issue and could not propose alternative text.",
      "Parties exchanged views on broad elements of adverse effects identified by G-77/China, and agreed to continue to consider further action under the two areas during an informal pre-sessional meeting prior to and during SBI 28 in June 2008, with a view to identifying activities that would facilitate the implementation of adaptation and address the impact of the implementation of response measures.",
      "South Africa, the EU and others supported having the pre-sessional meeting jointly convened by the SBSTA and SBI Chairs.",
      "However, the US opposed this, and delegates ultimately agreed that the meeting would be convened just by the SBI Chair."
