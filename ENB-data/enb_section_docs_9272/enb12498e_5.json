      "She said Bolivia s position would be reflected in the record of the conference, Supporting the adoption of the decision, the US observed that the practice under the UNFCCC had been closer to general agreement than consensus, since the COP had never adopted its rules of procedure.",

      "Grenada, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), called for an open-ended contact group to address the legal form of the AWG-LCA s outcome, also bringing in elements from the proposed protocols, and to develop an appropriate strategy to adopt a legally-binding outcome at COP 17.",
      "Many developing and developed countries expressed support for establishing a contact group on the legal form, with a number of parties emphasizing that it should avoid duplicating work.",

      "The contact group, chaired by Michael Zammit Cutajar (Malta), met for the first time on Friday, 3 December.",
      "Parties continued to hold different views on whether the AWG-LCA should lead to a COP decision(s) or a new protocol either complementing or replacing the Kyoto Protocol.",

      "Bolivia stressed that the credibility of any new legally-binding instrument depends on the adoption of a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol.",
      "India, China and others urged parties to focus on the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA.",
      "The US said he is not in a position to accept a new mandate that focuses only on the legal form without stating clearly that major economies will take on mitigation efforts with the same legal force as those by developed countries.",
      "On the way forward, Saint Lucia suggested keeping the agenda item open and requesting the COP Presidency to consider an intersessional process.",
      "The Marshall Islands presented detailed suggestions, including extending the AWG-LCA s mandate to take into account elements from proposals under Convention Article 17.",
      "AOSIS then introduced a draft COP decision text clarifying the intention to adopt a legally binding instrument in Durban that is complementary to the Kyoto Protocol.",
      "The issue was subsequently considered in informal consultations, where new text was discussed underscoring the complementary, interrelated and mutually supportive nature of the two AWGs, and the need for comprehensive and legally-binding instruments from both AWGs.",
      "The text also requested the AWG-LCA to continue its work and present a legally-binding instrument for adoption at COP 17.",
      "Responding to the proposal, several developing countries suggested that it was premature to discuss the legal status of an instrument before the substance of the instrument is clear.",

      "Outcome: During the COP closing plenary, parties agreed to continue consideration of this agenda item at COP 17.",
