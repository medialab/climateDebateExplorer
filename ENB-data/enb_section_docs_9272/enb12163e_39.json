      "During SB-13 Part II, compliance under the Protocol was considered by joint SBSTA/SBI meetings on Monday, 13, and Saturday, 18 November, and several times by the Joint Working Group on Compliance (JWG) from Tuesday, 14, to Friday, 17 November.",
      "Delegates focused on differentiation between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties, inclusion of principles, the role of the COP/MOP, consequences, and adoption.",
      "During the second week of COP-6, the issue was further considered by the COP Plenary on Monday, 20, and Saturday, 24 November, and by the informal high level Plenary on 20-23 November, as well as in informal consultations co-facilitated by Minister Siri Bjerke (Norway) and Minister Suresh Prabhu (India) as part of President Pronk's fourth cluster of 'crunch issues' - 'Box D.' Having failed to agree during final negotiations on 24 and 25 November, the JWG conclusions were forwarded to the resumed session of COP-6. SB-13 Part II: During the first session of the joint SBI/SBSTA on Monday, 13 November, Amb.",
      "Neroni Slade (Samoa), Co-Chair of the JWG, reported on informal consultations and said a revised text had been prepared that would serve as a basis for the negotiations. At the first session of the JWG on Tuesday, 14 November, Co-Chair Slade introduced the revised text.",
      "On the inclusion of principles within the text, the G-77/China, opposed by the US and Japan, urged their retention.",
      "On the plenary of the Compliance Committee, the G-77/China, opposed by the US, EU, Australia, the Russian Federation and New Zealand, said it should have an allocation as well as a preliminary examination function.",
      "On the mandate of the facilitation branch, the EU, with the US, Australia and New Zealand, and opposed by Saudi Arabia, China and the United Arab Emirates, said cases should be dealt with on their merits and not on the basis of the Party involved.",
      "On the mandate of the enforcement branch, the G-77/China said the branch should only deal with Annex I Parties.",
      "Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, opposed by Samoa and Japan, said Article 3.14 (adverse effects) was enforceable. On Wednesday, 15 November, following informal consultations by Co- Chair Slade, delegates reconvened in an evening session of the JWG and commented on the Co-Chairs' draft proposals presenting three options for the adoption of procedures and mechanisms on compliance: adoption by a decision; adoption as an amendment to the Protocol; and adoption as an agreement integrated into the Protocol.",
      "The G-77/China said it was premature to decide on one option.",
      "Japan, Australia and the Russian Federation, opposed by the US, the EU and Canada, supported adoption by a decision. On Thursday, 16 November, delegates met in the JWG, as well as in closed 'informal informal' consultations and drafting groups to continue work on negotiating text.",
      "During the formal session of the JWG, the G-77/China presented its views, contained in a new submission, on consequences under a compliance regime.",
      "On facilitative consequences, the G-77/China reiterated that these should be differentiated between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties.",
      "On enforcement consequences, she said these should only apply to Annex I Parties and, depending on the provision not complied with, include: suspension of Party's eligibility to participate in the mechanisms; submission of a compliance plan; declaration of non- compliance; suspension of rights and privileges; a contribution to the Compliance Fund; and deduction from its assigned amount in the subsequent commitment period against a penalty rate. On Friday, 17 November, delegates met in an 'informal informal' meeting to consider a revised Co-Chairs' text based on Wednesday's discussions and ensure that their proposals were adequately reflected.",
      "Delegates then convened in a formal session where they considered the report of the JWG.",
      "Co-Chair Dovland concluded the final meeting of the JWG by underlining that although delegates had hoped to have a clear text as the JWG's end product, this had been challenging due to the large number of difficult issues that had to be addressed. On Saturday, 18 November, Co-Chair Slade presented to the joint SBI/SBSTA the report of the JWG on its work during SB-13 Part II (FCCC/SB/2000/CRP.15/Rev.1).",
      "He said two submissions from Parties on the sections on Principles and the Relationship with Article 16 (Multilateral Consultative Process) had been inadvertently omitted.",
      "The report, as amended by Co-Chair Slade, was forwarded to the COP. COP-6 High-level Informal Discussions: On Monday 20, November, SBI Chair Ashe reported on the outcome of the work of the SBI during its 12th and 13th sessions, including the JWG draft conclusions (FCCC/SB/CRP.15/Rev.2).",
      "Delegates then met in an informal high- level Plenary where President Pronk suggested that the outstanding issues include: consequences, differentiation, composition, COP/MOP, legal form for adoption and mandate of the branches. On Tuesday, 21 November, President Pronk proposed that compliance with the Protocol be clustered in 'Box D' together with Articles 5, 7 and 8, and policies and measures. On Wednesday, 22 November, delegates convened in an informal high- level Plenary session to advance negotiations on the outstanding issues.",
      "Poland, for the Central Group Eleven, said the treatment of non-compliance should not be based on the Parties, but on the nature of the commitment.",
      "With the Russian Federation, she called for flexibility for countries with EIT.",
      "China highlighted that a strict compliance system should be based on Articles 5, 7 and 8.",
      "He added that the different responsibilities of Annex I and non- Annex I Parties should be reflected in the sections on principles, mandate and consequences.",
      "He concluded by raising the issue of the bodies' composition and called for adherence to the principles of fairness and equitable geographical representation.",
      "Pronk said the question of composition was a cross-cutting issue.",
      "Argentina expressed concern over the adoption of a compliance regime and a possible amendment of the Protocol before its entry into force.",
      "On consequences, he said good faith should constitute the main source of confidence in this agreement.",
      "The US said legally-binding consequences need not be punitive and highlighted that she supported a deduction from the following commitment period with a 1.3% penalty rate as well as a restriction on the transfer of units also applicable to Protocol Article 4 (joint fulfillment) Parties.",
      "The EU argued that Article 4 is not a mechanism, and, commenting on Argentina's intervention, said good faith is not sufficient due to inclusion of market-based mechanisms in the Protocol.",
      "He explained that legally-binding consequences were thus justified both by concerns over the environmental integrity of the Protocol, as well as by the necessity to provide the private sector with the confidence needed for the use of the mechanisms.",
      "The G-77/China stressed that non-compliance affects everyone, not only the trading partners of Annex I Parties, and urged that this must be reflected in the composition of the compliance committee. Australia and the Russian Federation argued for a non-binding regime and said their countries were more concerned about their own compliance than that of others.",
      "Supporting Australia, Japan explained that its main trading partners were not the other Annex I Parties but non-Annex I Asian countries.",
      "AOSIS said payment in a voluntary fund would actually provide Parties with an additional flexible mechanism. Delegates also met in closed informal consultations on these issues in the afternoon, although the meeting was cut short when protestors entered the room and disrupted negotiations.",
      "The consultations reconvened in the early evening and were followed by an informal high-level Plenary where co-facilitator Minister Bjerke reported that discussions had focused on consequences and highlighted the need for more time, given the interruption of the work. On Thursday, 23 November, Minister Bjerke reported that the previous night's discussions had focused on the establishment and structure of the Compliance Committee, the functions of the plenary, as well as on how principles could be reflected in the compliance text.",
      "She noted that more time was needed, since not all the 'crunch' issues had been resolved. President's Note: Thursday night's President's Note suggested that consequences for non-compliance with Article 3.1 (assigned amounts - AAs), be agreed in advance and consist of: subtraction of excess emissions from the AA of the subsequent commitment period against a penalty rate of 1.5 to 1.75%; and submission of a compliance action plan.",
      "On differentiation between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties, it proposed that: the mandate of the enforcement branch be limited to commitments incumbent on Annex I Parties; there are no eligibility requirements for non-Annex I Parties under the CDM; and facilitative consequences are not differentiated between these two groups of Parties.",
      "On the role of the COP/MOP, the note proposed limiting it to general policy guidance, and suggests having no appeals procedure.",
      "On the mandate, it proposed that the enforcement branch cover quantitative commitments and eligibility under Protocol Articles 6, 12 and 17, and that all other cases fall within the mandate of the facilitative branch. On the composition of the Compliance Committee, both the facilitative and the enforcement branch would have 11 members nominated on the basis of current UNFCCC practice.",
      "Under the enforcement branch, decisions would be adopted by a double majority as a whole, and in Annex I and non-Annex I, if there was no consensus.",
      "Finally, the note suggested that the compliance system be adopted, with legally binding consequences, as an agreement supplementing the Protocol prior to its entry into force. During the following days, this issue was discussed in closed informal meetings, both among delegates and high-level officials, without an agreement being reached on the issues identified in President Pronk's Note, in particular, the enforcement consequences. Conclusion of COP-6 Part I: During the Plenary meeting on Saturday, 25 November, COP-6 took note of the JWG draft conclusions (FCCC/SB/CRP.15/Rev.2) that contain one draft decision, the procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance under the Protocol, and final clauses. POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): During the first week of negotiations, delegates discussed text on P&Ms in five contact group meetings co-chaired by Jos\u00e9 Rom\u00e9ro (Switzerland) and Richard Muyungi (Tanzania), as well as in a number of closed 'informal informals.",
      "' Following the first week's negotiations, which centered on text developed during SB-13 Part I, a revised set of draft conclusions containing much bracketed text was presented by SBSTA-13 to the COP on Monday, 20 November.",
      "In the second week of negotiations, the issue of P&Ms was addressed in high-level informal discussions as part of President Pronk's fourth cluster of 'crunch issues' - 'Box D.' As a result of these discussions clean text of a draft decision on P&Ms was developed for adoption at the resumed session of COP-6. SB-13 Part II: In the opening SBSTA meeting on Monday, 13 November, Chair Dovland noted that SBSTA had agreed to continue consideration of the elements on a draft decision on 'best practices' in P&M that had been developed in earlier SBSTA meetings During the contact group negotiations during the first week, Parties proposed amendments to the negotiating text.",
      "Among the issues raised were whether to: delete the section of the preamble recalling specific provisions of the UNFCCC and Protocol; include reference to enhancing the effectiveness of P&Ms in terms of Protocol Article 2 (P&Ms) in its entirety or limit it to Article 2.1(b) (Cooperation on P&Ms); include reference to specific international organizations, including in particular OPEC, to support future work on P&Ms; and whether to request the Secretariat to compile information on P&Ms implemented and planned by Annex I Parties based on information in national communications.",
      "They also discussed the use of criteria and quantitative parameters to assess the effectiveness of P&Ms and the call by the G-77/China and Saudi Arabia for an assessment of the actions of Annex I Parties in striving to implement P&Ms in such a way as to minimize adverse effects.",
      "The EU and G-77/China underscored that future work on P&Ms should contribute to an assessment of demonstrable progress of Annex I Parties in achieving their Protocol commitments. The assessment of 'demonstrable progress' was one of the most contentious issues.",
      "Canada, with the support of Japan, Australia and the US, and opposed by the G-77/China and the EU, proposed replacing the existing decision and its associated initiatives with alternative text stating that consideration of demonstrable progress cannot take place until the SBSTA has considered the issue pursuant to the guidelines that may be elaborated under Article 7, given that Articles 2 and 3.2 provide no mandate for P&Ms to be considered in the context of demonstrable progress.",
      "Following 'informal informal' discussions at the end of the first week, the Co-Chairs proposed three broad options on this issue for consideration by the COP.",
      "In the closing meeting of SBSTA-13 Part II, Co-Chair Rom\u00e9ro presented the revised draft conclusions on 'best practices' in P&Ms among Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/CRP.14).",
      "These were forwarded for consideration by the COP. COP-6 High-level Informal Discussions: During the informal high- level consultations held during the second week, the issue of P&Ms was considered within the fourth cluster of 'crunch' issues identified by President Pronk, 'Box D,' which also included consideration of compliance and Articles 5, 7 and 8.",
      "In an informal high-level Plenary on Tuesday, 21 November, ministers and senior officials presented their views on the following outstanding 'crunch' issues on P&Ms: the assessment of 'demonstrable progress' under Protocol Article 3.2 by 2005; approaches to dealing with the adverse impacts of P&Ms on developing countries; and the possibility of defining common criteria to assess the effectiveness of P&Ms. The EU underlined the value of non-Annex I Parties participating in workshops on P&Ms, argued that emissions inventories alone are not comprehensive enough to assess demonstrable progress in 2005, and suggested a COP-7 decision on the information needed in this regard.",
      "The G-77/China said the whole of Protocol Article 2 should be referred to in the decision, and suggested keeping specific reference to 'Annex I Parties.",
      "' At the close of the informal high- level plenary on Tuesday, an informal group was established to consider the 'Box D' cluster of issues, facilitated by Ministers Bjerke and Prabhu. In the report back to the high-level Plenary on Wednesday evening, 22 November, Minister Bjerke reported that discussions on demonstrable progress had focused on what to report and when.",
      "She noted that a sub-group had identified a possible compromise, based on the earlier proposal by Canada.",
      "On Thursday morning, 23 November, she reported that the group had converged around the idea that reporting should take place in 2005 as a report separate from national communications. President's Note: President Pronk's Note, distributed in the evening of Thursday, 23 November, proposed that Parties continue information exchange on P&Ms, and that the COP invite the submission of views by Annex I Parties on the meaning of demonstrable progress and the need for guidelines for reporting on this progress, with a view to having further consideration at COP- 7. Conclusion of COP-6 Part I: By the conclusion of the meeting, negotiators managed to develop clean compromise text on a draft decision on 'good practices' in P&Ms among Annex I Parties (FCCC/CP/2000/CRP.6).",
      "This draft decision, inter alia: decides that future work on P&Ms should contribute to the improvement of transparency, effectiveness and comparability of P&Ms, by: enhancing transparency in reporting on P&Ms in the national communications of Annex I Parties through, as appropriate, criteria and quantitative parameters; facilitating information sharing on ways to minimize adverse effects of P&Ms; and assisting Parties in identifying further options for cooperation between Annex I Parties to enhance the individual and combined effectiveness of their P&Ms; and decides that future work should contribute to the elaboration of elements for reporting information on demonstrable progress. This draft decision will be considered further at the resumed session of COP-6."
