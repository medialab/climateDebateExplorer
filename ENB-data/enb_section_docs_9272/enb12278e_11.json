      "The final text states, inter alia, that: the local risks associated with CO2 pipelines could be similar or lower than those posed by existing hydrocarbon pipelines; the risks of geological storage would be comparable to those of natural gas storage with the appropriate measures; the effects of CO2 on marine organisms will have ecosystem consequences; the chronic effects of CO2 injection into oceans have not yet been studied over large ocean areas and long time scales; and the environmental impacts of large-scale mineral carbonation would be a consequence of the required mining and disposal of the resulting products. Will physical leakage of stored CO2 compromise CCS as a climate mitigation option?",
      "Delegates took up this section of the SPM, which was previously titled 'What are the global risks of CCS?",
      "' in plenary and in an informal contact group on Saturday.",
      "Discussions centered on the differences between geological and ocean storage, particularly in relation to retention times, and on the extent of knowledge on leakage from storage sites."
