   "sentences": [
      "The ADP morning informal consultations continued with mitigation.",
      "A number of parties agreed on the importance to ensure broad participation in the 2015 agreement.",
      "Some stressed that mitigation commitments must be differentiated in accordance with CBDR, and that enhanced mitigation by developing countries depends on the provision of means of implementation.",
      "Calls were made for agreement in Warsaw on launching national consultations on mitigation pledges.",
      "Parties also discussed the process for defining mitigation commitments, including ex ante assessment of pledges, with some calling for common rules and stressing that the assessment must be based on science.",
      "Some parties identified the need to balance the flexibility of nationally-determined commitments and the rigidity of commonly agreed rules to ensure environmental integrity.",
      "Suggestions were made to create 'an upward spiral of ambition' with facilitative engagement to compare commitments among countries.",
      "It was also proposed that the 2015 agreement be flexible and adjustable to developments in science and capabilities.",
      "One party stressed that commitments must be fulfilled by domestic means, without relying on offsets.",
      "Parties discussed historical responsibilities, with some proposing to mandate the IPCC to develop a methodology, while others indicated that a focus on historical responsibilities will not ensure achievement of the 2 \u00b0C goal. RELEVANT EXPERIENCE OF OTHER MEAs: The ADP workshop on relevant experience of other MEAs took place in the afternoon.",
      "Co-Chair Kumarsingh identified the workshop as an opportunity to identify concrete arrangements to enhance pre-2020 ambition under workstream 2.",
      "Secretary-General John Scanlon, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), highlighted that: the CITES includes clear obligations; the rules allow for voting, which has been used; and national authorities are the 'engine room' of implementation.",
      "Jorge Oca\u00f1a, UNEP Chemicals, highlighted National Implementation Plans under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs).",
      "He said lessons learned could be from the creation of national action plans and provision of support through the Convention's financial mechanism, the Secretariat and implementation agencies.",
      "Megumi Seki, Secretariat of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, emphasized that the Protocol is one of the most successful MEAs with universal membership; offers sufficient incentives for all countries to join in; and is supported by industry.",
      "She added that the Protocol's success hinges on science-based broadening of the scope for action, and confidence and trust among parties.",
      "In discussions, parties addressed: enabling parties to opt out of new obligations; relationship between UNEP and the CITES Secretariat; application of the precautionary principle under the Montreal Protocol; differentiation between developed and developing countries' obligations; addressing GHGs under the Montreal Protocol; provisions concerning participation, especially of non-parties; and the impact of obligations on non-parties."
