      "Some delegates were studying comments made during the in-session SBSTA adaptation workshop over issues of climate change versus natural climate variability.",
      "One observer suggested the issue could have more to do with liability than atmospheric science. Meanwhile, at the end of a busy but unexceptional Saturday in the contact groups, Secretariat staff and contact group chairs retired to their offices burdened with preparing a large number of draft decisions and conclusions by Monday. There was some compensation for their 'lost weekend' in Bonn, though, with the prospect Saturday evening of the traditional NGO party.",
      "'Some Parties may be saving their energy for COP/MOP 1,' said one participant, 'but the most important Party here is the NGO Party,' he added, referring to Saturday night`s festivities."
