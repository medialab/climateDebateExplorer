      "Chair Pachauri underscored that the primary task of the AR5 scoping meeting is to generate chapter outlines for the three WG reports, as well as to consider the structure and broad content of the SYR.",
      "He called for governments to submit policy-relevant questions as early as possible.",
      "Germany, Austria and the Netherlands supported inviting governments to submit their views on policy-relevant questions for the SYR and on cross-cutting topics.",
      "Sudan, supported by Switzerland, cautioned against an imbalanced and non-representative list of policy-relevant questions.",
      "The US highlighted that early identification of policy-relevant questions for the SYR will help integrating them into the structure of the WGs reports and thus provide better synthesis of information.",
      "The US and Australia highlighted the iterative nature of the process of developing policy-relevant questions for the SYR.",
      "Parties agreed to establish a contact group to discuss this.",
      "In the contact group, co-chaired by Ian Carruthers (Australia) and Antonina Ivanova Boncheva (Mexico), delegates discussed whether parties should submit policy-relevant questions, issues or topics; the need for authors to have authorship over questions; and the need for dialogue between authors and the policy community during the assessment process.",
      "The US noted that any identified policy-relevant questions should not send a wrong signal to authors that policy makers do not need a comprehensive assessment.",
      "Delegates deliberated on ways to categorize questions, for instance around the past, present and future, and the need to explain a rationale for questions to scientists.",
      "Delegates also discussed that the AR4 SYR could be a basis for policy-relevant questions and that the policy context will change by the time of preparation of the SYR in 2014.",
      "In the final plenary, Co-Chair Carruthers presented Co-Chairs notes, summarizing discussions of the contact group.",
      "He noted that it was only an initial exchange of views and suggestions and that the process of developing policy-relevant questions will continue in the coming months."
