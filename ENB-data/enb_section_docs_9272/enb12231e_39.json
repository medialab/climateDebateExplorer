      "On Monday, 1 December, the SBI addressed the consideration of the fifth compilation and synthesis of initial national communications, the work of the Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I national communications (CGE), and provision of financial and technical support in SBI, agreeing to convene a contact group, chaired by Sok Appadu (Mauritius) to further consider non-Annex I national communications. On Thursday, 4 December, SBI addressed the issue of submission of second, and where appropriate, third national communications.",

In the contact group on Friday, 5 December, Parties addressed the fifth compilation and synthesis report and work of the CGE.",
      "Parties addressed how CGE workshops should be organized, with the EU, opposed by the G-77/China, suggesting that workshops could address all thematic areas in a combined approach, rather than addressing one theme only. On Saturday, 6 December, the contact group considered provision of financial and technical support, and the timing of submissions of second and, where appropriate, third national communications.",

      "' Chair Appadu requested submissions from Parties on their views, for inclusion in the draft conclusions and COP decision.

      "The EU proposed text that national communications assist the COP to review the UNFCCC`s implementation. On Tuesday, 9 December, delegates met twice in the contact group.",
      "The G-77/China suggested text stating that frequency of submissions of national communications shall be dependent on the availability of funding.",
      "The EU, US and Australia favored text requiring that second national communications be submitted within three years of the availability of financial resources.",
      "The G-77/China underlined that it would not discuss the issue of frequency of submissions.",
      "The US, opposed by the G-77/China, recommended text requiring non-Annex I Parties to submit national inventories every two years.",
      "Informal consultations continued throughout the day. On Wednesday, 10 December, SBI adopted its conclusions, and agreed to forward a draft decision to the COP."
