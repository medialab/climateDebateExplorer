      "Philip Gwage (Uganda) and David Warrilow (UK) co-chaired the in-session workshop, which addressed the development of a SBSTA five-year work programme on adaptation, as required by the Buenos Aires Programme on Adaptation (1/CP.10). Delegates heard presentations from keynote speaker Ian Burton, University of Toronto, and 15 country representatives.",
      "Many presenters highlighted technology transfer for adaptation, sharing methodologies, avoiding duplication of work, a sectoral focus, regional monitoring centers, and integration with sustainable development and poverty eradication. Ian Burton noted that the aim of adaptation is to reduce present and future losses.",
      "He underscored the adaptation deficit and noted that, from a strictly economic perspective, developed and rapidly developing countries will suffer most.",
      "He also emphasized the need for a comprehensive, flexible, phased work programme with clear objectives that considers specific issues such as adaptation baselines and measurement of progress. JAPAN stressed the need for international coordinated action for both developed and developing countries.",
      "CHINA called for a practical and substantial approach, proposing hands-on expert meetings rather than more workshops.",
      "CANADA emphasized risk assessment and management, and stressed the importance of engaging both practitioners and policy makers.",
      "NEW ZEALAND suggested inviting voluntary submissions on adaptive capacities in national communications.",
      "The EU proposed maximizing synergies, promoting linkages to mitigation and, with CANADA, a review of the programme following publication of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.",
      "The US suggested a review after five years. ARGENTINA proposed clustering adaptation and response measures.",
      "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION underscored the need for regional adaptation, regional projections and observation systems.",
      "AOSIS called for a specific programme for SIDS, consistent with the Mauritius Strategy.",
      "SOUTH AFRICA supported a best practice clearing house, rapid vulnerability assessments, and early warning systems.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA highlighted UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol commitments, and urged support for Parties vulnerable to the impacts of response measures, especially oil-exporting developing countries.",
      "Bangladesh, for LDCs, spoke about micro-insurance and tools and methodologies to assist LDCs.",
      "AUSTRALIA called for analysis of available tools and methods, and for targeted workshops.",
      "SWITZERLAND proposed that the Secretariat maintain a methodologies website. Co-Chair Warrilow invited comments from the floor, with delegates highlighting, inter alia, the need for: SBSTA`s work programme to provide added value; increased knowledge and awareness on climate change impacts; financial resources for the work programme; strengthened national and local adaptation institutions; economic valuation of adaptation measures; linkages with the Adaptation Fund; linkages to take advantage of experiences in adaptation to other phenomena and climate variability; a differentiation of adaptation from disaster response; bottom-up approaches; and tools for rapid assessment and identification of critical thresholds.",
      "A contact group will be established."
