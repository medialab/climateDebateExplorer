      "This issue was considered on Friday evening.",
      "Delegates discussed a proposal from Venezuela to replace Bureau member Maria Martelo with Miriam Diaz (IPCC-XXVII/Doc.5).",
      "The Secretariat explained that, following the mandate given at IPCC-26, a letter had been sent to Venezuela to request further information on the reason for the replacement.",
      "In response, Venezuela had explained that Martelo had ended her relationship with the Government for personal reasons.",
      "Pointing to Rule 12 of the IPCC Election Procedures, Belgium said such a replacement is only possible with clear evidence that the current IPCC Bureau member has resigned or is otherwise unable to complete assigned term of office.",
      "He said the information provided by Venezuela did not offer this evidence.",
      "South Africa suggested contacting Martelo directly, rather than through the Government.",
      "Australia supported Belgium and cautioned against setting a precedent where governments can remove dedicated Bureau members.",
      "WGI Co-Chair Susan Solomon underscored that this could go beyond Bureau members, for example if a government decided to remove a nominated Coordinating Lead Author, and urged direct consultations with Martelo, and delegates agreed."
