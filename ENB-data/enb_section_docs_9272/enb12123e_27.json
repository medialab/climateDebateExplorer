      "The agenda item on national systems, adjustments and guidelines under Protocol Articles 5 (methodology), 7 (communications) and 8 (review of information) was considered by SBSTA on Monday, 25 October.",
      "Taka Hiraishi, Vice-Chair of the IPCC Inventories Task Force, reported on the ongoing work on uncertainties and good practice in inventory preparation. Regarding guidelines for national systems, the EU, with JAPAN, said they should be flexible in order to reflect differing national circumstances.",
      "The US highlighted the need to incorporate IPCC work relating to good practices.",
      "AUSTRALIA proposed including, inter alia, quality assurance and quality control procedures, links between national systems and emissions trading systems, and links with the transfer and acquisition of AAUs.",
      "SWITZERLAND said guidelines should include criteria for national enforcement systems to comply with relevant guidelines, and the establishment and treatment of data related to Protocol mechanisms. Regarding adjustments, CANADA noted the lack of clarity in what an adjustment would be.",
      "With NEW ZEALAND, he expressed support for a technical review process of inventories, noting that this is fundamental to the development of an adjustment process.",
      "AUSTRALIA said adjustments are intended as an element of the Protocol's compliance system.",
      "The EU and JAPAN stated that further discussion on technical aspects should only occur after the completion of the IPCC's work on good practice.",
      "Following requests by some Parties, the Chair convened a contact group chaired by Helen Plume (New Zealand) to consider the issue further. The contact group met three times from 29 October - 1 November to consider the Chair's draft conclusions and an annex setting out a preliminary list of basic elements for national systems under Protocol Article 5.1 (national systems for GHG emissions and removals). On Thursday, 4 November, the COP endorsed the SBSTA conclusions on national systems, adjustments and guidelines (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.14), whereby SBSTA is encouraged to complete by COP-6 its work on guidelines under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8.",
      "In its conclusions, SBSTA, inter alia: requests that any compliance-related aspects of the Article 8 review process be taken up by the joint working group on compliance; recalls a decision at SBSTA-10 calling on the Secretariat to organize a workshop on national systems and issues relating to adjustments and provide a report at SBSTA-12; agrees to consider the basic elements of national systems outlined in the annex to the conclusion as the basis for further work; and encourages Annex I Parties to support efforts of those Annex I Parties undergoing the process of transition to a market economy to develop and consolidate their national systems through appropriate bilateral and multilateral mechanisms."
