      "On Saturday, 13 December, COP 20 President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal indicated that we are very close to building the basis of a successful outcome in Paris, expressing hope and trust that parties will work together to find the balance needed for moving the process forward. ADP Co-Chair Artur Runge-Metzger noted that the objective of the meeting was to adopt results of the hard work, engagement and progress over the past two weeks reflected in the revised draft decision (FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5).",
      "Singapore reported on Friday s ministerial consultations, emphasizing a shared sense of urgency for progress and the need for trust in five areas: - the need for the Lima outcome to be under the Convention; - the need for balance in the scope of INDCs, which can include but cannot be confined to mitigation; - financial support needs to be available without backsliding on developed countries prior commitments; - the scale of ambition needs to be able to keep the global temperature rise under 2 \u00b0 or 1.5 \u00b0C; and - Lima s outcome should not prejudge the legal form of the Paris agreement or affect the Convention s firewall between developed and developing countries.",
      "Switzerland, for the Environmental Integrity Group, the EU, Belize, Chile, for AILAC, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Turkey endorsed the Co-Chairs text.",

      "He looked forward to an agreement that: is more ambitious than ever before; is built to last; applies to all parties in a genuine manner; is fully differentiated in terms of CBDRRC expressed in light of national circumstances; is built on the basis of rules-based accountability; and encompasses commitments to financial assistance.",
      "Sudan, for the African Group, Malaysia, for the LMDCs, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, India, Uganda, Paraguay, Pakistan and others opposed the text.",
      "The African Group stressed the importance of: the principles of the Convention; the concept of differentiation, cautioning against undermining it implicitly or explicitly; adaptation and MOI as Africa s priorities; and equal and balanced treatment of these elements alongside mitigation and transparency.",
      "Noting that the gap is closing little by little, Nigeria asked parties to address issues raised by the African Group.",
      "Calling the text unacceptable as it stands, the Democratic Republic of the Congo identified areas not addressed, including: parity among elements; differentiation; scope of INDCs beyond mitigation; and workstream 2 (pre-2020 ambition).",
      "The LMDCs expressed disappointment that the text: does not recognize CBDR, and differentiation in INDCs and information to be submitted; introduces parties in a position to do so ; does not adequately address finance; is mitigation-centered; and prejudges the Paris agreement.",

      "Noting the lack of consensus on the draft decision, the ADP Co-Chairs forwarded the draft decision to the COP President under their own authority.",
      "ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger remarked that while some speak of a divide, in the Co-Chairs view, parties are united in the battle against climate change, but with different perceptions on how to move forward. ADP Rapporteur Anna Serzysko presented, and parties adopted, the report of the session (FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4).",
