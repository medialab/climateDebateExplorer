   "sentences": [
      "The non-group on continuing to advance commitments under Article 4.1 met three times under the chairmanship of Evans King (Trinidad and Tobago).",
      "When King had to return to his country, the non-group continued consultations under John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda). Initially delegates agreed to negotiate on the basis of a paper prepared by the Chair.",
      "Regarding chapeau paragraphs on advancing the implementation of commitments, some non- Annex I countries reportedly sought to include references to the Berlin Mandate.",
      "They also supported referring to FCCC elements, including a specific reference to the introduction of no new non-Annex I commitments, but some Annex I countries objected. Some delegations were reluctant to include a reference to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.",
      "There were proposals to delete paragraphs that conditioned advancement of commitments by non-Annex I Parties on the provision of financial resources and transfer of technology by developed countries. A developed country put forward an alternative draft paper that would commit Parties to advance implementation of Article 4.1 and to strengthen collaboration. Several paragraphs were deleted including those that called on Parties to: recognize the progress that has been made on Article 4.1; reaffirm their commitments to 4.1; and to develop further international cooperation on the basis of mutually beneficial incentive structures.",
      "One delegation called for the preparation of national inventories on an annual basis.",
      "Some non-Annex I countries opposed annual inventories because of financial and technical limitations. Many countries proposed the deletion of a paragraph calling for cooperation to facilitate mitigation and adaptation to climate change.",
      "Non-Annex I countries noted a strong objection to the paragraph calling for specific definitions on policies and measures. Paragraphs noting the role that development and transfer of technology should play and calling for entities entrusted with operation of the financial mechanism to make available financial assistance for the introduction of technology were deleted. On Saturday, 2 August, the Chair agreed to produce a new text for further discussion containing alternatives for articles lacking consensus.",
      "The draft text on advancing implementation of existing commitments in Article 4.1 has a chapeau and two alternatives.",
      "The chapeau language that the 'text is without prejudice to the provisions of Article 4.1' resulted from a debate over whether the draft should include full references to FCCC articles.",
      "The note that 'all paragraphs remain open for negotiation and are not agreed' appears on the text, most of which is heavily bracketed. The first alternative notes common but differentiated responsibilities, capabilities, national and regional development priorities, objectives and circumstances.",
      "It states that Parties shall not introduce any new commitments for non-Annex I Parties but reaffirm and continue to advance existing ones. The second alternative also pledges Parties to advance Article 4.1 commitments and adds that they shall strengthen collaboration through bilateral, multilateral and Convention-based mechanisms.",
      "Text on existing commitments by non-Annex I Parties makes implementation contingent upon effective implementation of Annex I Parties` commitments related to financial resources and technology transfer.",
      "It also calls economic development and poverty eradication the 'first and overriding priority' of developing country Parties. The financial mechanism, according to bracketed text in the second alternative, is to provide necessary resources for implementation of provisions in 10 areas based on sub- articles of the FCCC: emissions inventories; national programmes; technology; GHG sinks and reservoirs; climate change impacts; climate change considerations in relevant policies and actions; research and observation; information exchange; education, training and public awareness; and information related to implementation.",
      "The alternative states that a fund or funds for provision of new and additional financial resources, which are predictable and adequate for developing countries implementation of existing commitments, shall be set up under the Protocol. The section on emissions inventories includes bracketed references to submissions on 'an annual basis' and 'annual' inventory data.",
      "The section on relevant policies and actions includes two alternatives on indicators: one calling for use of 'national level' indicators and the other suggesting use of relevant indicators to the extent possible.",
      "The section on information related to implementation contains three alternatives.",
      "One calls for communication of information by the second COP of the protocol.",
      "The second calls for in-depth reviews.",
      "The third describes in depth reviews of 'Annex I' or 'Annex Q' parties communications and consideration of 'non-Annex I' or 'non-Annex Q' communications."
