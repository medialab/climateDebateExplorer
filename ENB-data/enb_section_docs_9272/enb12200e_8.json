      "Delegates to SBSTA-16 considered issues related to the guidelines under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8 in a plenary session on Wednesday, 5 June, before taking up the matter in a contact group chaired by Helen Plume (New Zealand) and Festus Luboyera (South Africa).",
      "The contact group met seven times, developing draft conclusions that were adopted by the SBSTA on Thursday, 13 June. At the opening SBSTA Plenary on Wednesday, 5 June, Chair Thorgeirsson highlighted issues to be covered by SBSTA-16 relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 relating to: sections of the guidelines under Articles 7 and 8 that were not concluded during COP-7, including reporting and review of assigned amounts and national registries, and procedures for expedited review for the reinstatement of eligibility to use the mechanisms; technical aspects of review of demonstrable progress; and the treatment of confidential information.",
      "Audun Rosland (Norway) reported on a workshop on adjustments under Article 5.2, and Murray Ward (New Zealand) reported on intersessional consultations on technical standards for registries under Article 7.4.",
      "The issue was then referred to a contact group. On Thursday, 6 June, the contact group began discussing the review for reinstatement of mechanisms` eligibility, and continued to do so during several subsequent meetings.",
      "A small drafting group was also convened to focus on, inter alia, the review timeframe. On Saturday, 8 June, Brazil, on behalf of the G-77/China, stressed links between work on the pending parts of Articles 7 and 8 and outcomes from the group on LULUCF under the CDM.",
      "A draft COP-8 decision on demonstrable progress under Article 3.2 was then considered.",
      "The G-77/China and the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) stressed concern about evaluating progress.",
      "Delegates agreed to text proposed by the G-77/China requesting Parties to report on progress incorporating work under P&Ms. On the draft conclusions, which were discussed on Wednesday, 12 June, the G-77/China suggested adding a new paragraph stating that SBSTA agrees to further elaborate the pending parts of the guidelines following the result of the process of developing definitions and modalities for including LULUCF under the CDM.",
      "After protracted discussions, Parties arrived at a compromise for considering at a later stage the implications, if any, of the work on LULUCF under the CDM on the pending parts of the guidelines.",
      "The SBSTA adopted the conclusions on Thursday, 13 June."
