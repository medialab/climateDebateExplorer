      "The subgroup on agriculture proposed the creation of a vulnerability index that would use indicators to evaluate vulnerability across multiple sectors.",
      "They emphasized that all data is collected with a clear objective in mind, and cautioned that drawing upon old data for the purpose of monitoring vulnerability might be problematic if it was collected for a different purpose.",
      "The group also discussed dissemination of information at the regional, national and community levels.",
      "SPREP noted that indices are useful for tracking a country s performance over time, but should not be used to compare countries to each other.",
      "One participant questioned this approach, saying that it is unlikely that one index would be suitable for all situations, and that a smaller set of well targeted indicators would better serve local needs.",
      "The Cook Islands commented that data related to household food production is often overlooked in studies that focus on food produced for market or export.",
      "SPREP noted that the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has initiated a programme on climate and food security, and that the University of the South Pacific has written a paper on this topic."
