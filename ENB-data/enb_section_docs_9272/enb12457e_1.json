      "UNFCCC Executive Secretary de Boer informed delegates that the COP plenary would convene in the early afternoon to consider the AWG-LCA s report and decide on how to proceed in terms of taking the documents forward.

      "SOUTH AFRICA recalled the COP Presidency s undertaking to ensure a party-driven process.",
      "BOLIVIA said the problem was one of substance, not just procedure, highlighting that the Danish texts did not reflect the outcome of a democratic or participatory process. COP President Rasmussen explained that the Danish texts had not yet been presented and that the Presidency fully respected the will of parties.",
      "He reminded parties that the COP plenary would convene in the afternoon and parties could then decide how to proceed.",
      "Parties then moved on to the high-level segment to hear statements by Heads of State, Heads of Government and other heads of delegation.",
      "Nafie Ali Nafie, Assistant President of Sudan, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed the need to maintain a two-track outcome under the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA, establish a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol on the basis of comparable and ambitious emission reductions, and respect the Convention s principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.",

      "Penny Wong, Minister for Climate and Water of Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, called for an agreement delivering an environmental outcome and which has legally-binding commitments for all major economies to realize a 50% reduction in global emissions by 2050.",
