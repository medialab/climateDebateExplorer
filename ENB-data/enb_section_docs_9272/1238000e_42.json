      "The change in the US position to support a legally binding agreement pleased many environmental NGOs, and some predicted that the move by the US would force many delegations, some of whom had shielded their own opposition behind that of the US, into supporting a legally binding agreement.",
      "However, linking a protocol to tradeable permits led some delegates to raise both theoretical and practical issues.",
      "AOSIS members openly noted that this could leave the AOSIS protocol, which calls for a 20% reduction in emissions, 'dead in the water.",
      "' Some developing countries spoke against heavy reliance on market- based schemes, arguing that markets favor the wealthy and often solidify, rather than resolve, inequities.",
      "Many delegates noted that a tradeable permit scheme raises a myriad of practical questions and expressed concern about 'creative' implementation."
