      "Most emphasized the need for adequate funding for the Board and associated bodies, while several stressed the need to send a signal to the market on the CDM`s continuation after 2012. India, for the G-77/CHINA, highlighted recent accomplishments, including the awarding of the first certified emissions reductions (CERs).",
      "JAPAN said projects for district heating, energy efficiency and transport should be encouraged.",
      "COLOMBIA and GHANA drew attention to CDM potential in the transport sector.",
      "The EU noted the linking of the EU emissions trading scheme to the Kyoto mechanisms, and concerns that the CDM process needs to be improved to deliver projects and CERs on the scale sought by Parties. CANADA stressed the Board`s 'strategic oversight' role and the pressing need for a package of CDM-strengthening measures.",
      "NEPAL and CAMBODIA raised the issue of non-renewable biomass, while BRAZIL and AOSIS underscored the need to maintain CDM`s environmental integrity. PANAMA noted concerns on the proposal to finance the Board through CDM proceeds, and endorsed the idea of sectoral CDM.",

      "CHILE, supported by several others, proposed extending the Marrakesh Accords deadline for registering prompt start CDM projects. The International Emissions Trading Association, speaking for BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY groups, called for a significant reform package, including new guidance on additionality.",
      "David Brackett (Canada) and Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago (Brazil) will co-chair a contact group."
