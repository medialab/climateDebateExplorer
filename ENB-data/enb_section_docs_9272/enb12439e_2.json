      "Chair Zammit Cutajar expressed hope that the non-papers would enable parties to discuss the key issues in their capitals and come to Barcelona with a clear mandate to move the process forward.",
      "He also highlighted that the length of the negotiating text was not the key issue, but rather the number of substantive issues reflected within those pages that need to be resolved.",
      "Discussions by the AWG-LCA contact groups and mitigation sub-groups on the key elements of the BAP are summarized below.",
      "Shared Vision: The contact group on a shared vision for long-term cooperative action was chaired by Chair Zammit Cutajar and facilitated by Sandea de Wet (South Africa).",

      "33, incorporating parties inputs, which will be issued before the next meeting in Barcelona .",
      "Mitigation: On mitigation, the BAP contains the following sub-paragraphs: 1(b)(i) on mitigation by developed countries; 1(b)(ii) on mitigation by developing countries; 1(b)(iii) on reducing deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, plus conservation (REDD-plus); 1(b)(iv) on sectoral approaches; 1(b)(v) on various approaches to enhance the cost-effectiveness of mitigation action, including markets; and 1(b)(vi) on consequences of response measures.",

      "India and several other developing countries opposed, stressing that such proposals are inconsistent with the Convention as they would impose new requirements on developing countries.",
      "After informal consultations on 29 September, parties agreed that proposals related to common frameworks for mitigation action by all parties would be discussed in the overarching contact group on mitigation issues.",
      "The overarching contact group on mitigation convened from 1-9 October.",

      "He said that financial support would be provided for countries that are not capable of meeting the cost, and said that the sub-elements of the broad framework would be different, for instance, for the LDCs and for developing countries that have more capacity and responsibility.",
      "Australia elaborated on her country s proposal on national schedules of mitigation commitments or actions, noting that the proposal goes beyond a pledge and review, takes into account different circumstances and capabilities of parties, and enables transparency and enhanced action over time.",

      "She highlighted synergies with proposals on low-carbon development strategies and registries.",
      "The EU called for a collective effort from all to create low-carbon development strategies.",
      "He stressed the need to carry over the key Kyoto elements for developed countries, including: economy-wide and binding quantified emission limitation or reduction objectives (QELROs); robust reporting and accounting consistent with Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8; the flexibility mechanisms; and notions of compliance.",
      "He highlighted the need for an architecture that enables developing country nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) to go forward, and expressed interest in exploring the idea of national schedules.",
      "Brazil, for the G-77/China, opposed the proposals on frameworks for mitigation action by all parties, stressing the distinction between mitigation by developed and developing countries both in magnitude and legal nature.",
      "India and China also opposed the proposals, with India stressing that they conflict with the Convention and the BAP, as they seek to erase the distinction between developed and developing countries and impose new mitigation and reporting commitments on the latter.",
      "Non-paper no.",

      "The discussions focused on the comparability of efforts, mitigation commitments or actions, MRV and compliance.",
      "On comparability of efforts , discussions revolved around the need for explicit comparability criteria, framing of comparability and emphasis on national or international assessment.",
      "Several developed countries indicated that it was not necessary to include a list of comparability criteria in the outcome.",
      "The EU specified that such criteria can be useful for the negotiations but not necessary to include in the text.",
      "Brazil, for the G-77/China, stressed the need for a solid and strong definition of comparability, highlighting the Protocol as the basis for comparability assessment and identifying the need to define comparability through international negotiations rather than nationally.",
      "Tuvalu stressed the need for a legal and prescriptive approach to comparability and highlighted the Protocol as the benchmark.",

      "The US said stringency and comparability were different issues and supported focusing on national compliance structures.",
      "Referring to the Protocol targets, he highlighted that while the numbers are similar for different Annex I countries, there are important differences in actions taken to comply with the targets, cost of action and visions on how the target affects the country s future emissions.",
      "The G-77/China noted that the Protocol s targets were based on pledges, which was not the solution preferred by all countries, and stressed the need for adequate mid and long-term mitigation by developed countries.",
      "Japan noted that, in addition to numbers, policies and measures can also be used in discussing comparability.",
      "On mitigation commitments or actions , the EU, supported by Norway, highlighted the level of ambition as the core of the discussions.",
      "The US called for focusing on operational language rather than on expectations.",

      "Norway outlined plans to reduce emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2020.",
      "Parties also discussed informally a proposal from the EU to compile information on pledges for mid-term emission reductions by all Annex I countries, similar to the complication of Protocol parties pledges under the AWG-KP.",
      "Although many countries supported preparing such a compilation, views diverged on what this exercise should include.",
      "Brazil, with Saudi Arabia and Bolivia, highlighted the need to address adequacy of Annex I countries pledges in relation to historical responsibility and level of ambition in the mid and long-term.",
      "India, with AOSIS, suggested widening the scope to include an assessment of adequacy in accordance with the latest available scientific literature.",
      "The US proposed the paper be viewed within a larger and more comprehensive framework, and address not only pledges but also actions to support them.",
      "Parties also discussed the concept of national schedules of mitigation commitments and actions proposed by Australia, with India opposing it and Brazil noting that the concept, by combining a reference to commitments and actions, weakens commitments by developed countries.",

      "India, Nepal and Thailand highlighted the need to keep REDD-plus separate from NAMAs.",
      "India, with Guyana, Saudi Arabia and China, emphasized the importance of identifying activities and actions that would qualify for REDD-plus before addressing principles.",
