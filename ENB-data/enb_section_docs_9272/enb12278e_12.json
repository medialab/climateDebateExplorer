      "The final text states, inter alia, that: the fraction of CO2 retained in appropriately selected and managed geological reservoirs is likely to exceed 99% over 1,000 years; the release of CO2 from ocean storage would be gradual over hundreds of years; and if continuous leakage of CO2 occurs, it could, at least in part, offset the benefits of CCS for mitigating climate change. What are the legal and regulatory issues for implementing CO2 storage?",
      "Delegates took up this section of the SPM in plenary on Saturday.",
      "On regulations that may be applicable to geological storage, discussions centered on the need to indicate that the list of regulations provided is non-exhaustive, and on the inclusion of reference to pollution controls in the list.",
      "Regarding CO2 injection into the ocean or sub-seabed, discussions focused on the interpretation, evolution and applicability of international law.",
      "Delegates also considered a proposal by the Netherlands to include reference to cross-border geological storage, deletion of a reference to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, as proposed by the US, and Japan`s proposal to delete text elaborating on the OSPAR and London Conventions."
