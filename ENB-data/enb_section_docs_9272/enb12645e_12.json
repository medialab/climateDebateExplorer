      "He said the workshop brought together a unique combination of scientists to provide more links and collaboration between WGI and WGII.",
      "He highlighted recommendations and needs that were identified, saying an information paper would be developed as an input into AR6, and pointed to four outreach activities aimed at reaching: school students, about climate change; Brazilian scientists, to respond to questions on global climate modeling, regional modeling and downscaling; users and practitioners, to examine tools to access information from climate models and simulations; and media, to communicate AR5.",
      "The Panel took note of the report."
