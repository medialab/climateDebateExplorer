      "This agenda item was first taken up in SBSTA plenary on 18 May , and then a contact group and informal meetings.",
      "Discussions, co-chaired by Helen Plume (New Zealand) and William Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana), centered on the initial list of activities for the programme of work, as set out in the report of a workshop held in Vienna, Austria, from 13-15 March 2006.",
      "The list includes tables with modalities, deliverables and timing for nine initial activities on: methods and tools; data and observations; climate modeling, scenarios and downscaling; climate-related risks and extreme events; socioeconomic information; adaptation planning and practices; research; technologies for adaptation; and economic diversification.",
      "Consistent with their initial statements to plenary, AOSIS, China and others expressed concern that the programme of work as it stood added little to work already underway, and called for practical and substantial outputs, while the US emphasized the need for stocktaking.",
      "Over the following days, parties proceeded through the tables in informal group meetings, with the G-77/China adding various proposals to the text, including requests for recommendations on how to address the issues and on practical implementation as part of the deliverables from the various activities.",
      "Some progress was reported when the Co-Chairs presented their draft conclusions.",
      "However, following closed consultations among a small group, parties reported fundamental differences on how they perceived their mandate at this session.",
      "The G-77/China explained that, in accordance with Decision 2/CP.11 (which requests SBSTA to consider and further elaborate additional activities and modalities of the five-year programme of work ), it had sought to define and further elaborate the activities covered under the five-year programme of work.",
      "In contrast, the US said that it had focused on establishing the modalities for the initial list of activities to be delivered in the first two years of the programme.",
      "Although informal consultations continued and the G-77/China and others expressed a willingness to accept the proposed bracketed draft conclusions with minor amendments, other parties expressed reservations.",
      "Unable to agree, they concentrated instead on defining the mandate for SBSTA 25 to continue work on the issue.",
      "This situation was reflected in the conclusions on this matter, which were adopted by SBSTA on 26 May ."
