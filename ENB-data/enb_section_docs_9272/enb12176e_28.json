      "The COP agrees that it is the host Party's prerogative to confirm whether JI/CDM project activities assist in achieving sustainable development, and that Annex I Parties 'refrain' from using Emission Reduction Units (ERUs)/CERs generated from nuclear facilities to meet Article 3.1 commitments.",
      "On JI, the COP agrees to recommend to the COP/MOP the establishment of a supervisory committee to supervise, inter alia, the verification of ERUs. On the CDM, the COP agrees to emphasize that public funding for CDM projects from Annex I Parties is not to result in the diversion of ODA, and is to be separate from and not counted towards the financial obligations of Annex I Parties.",
      "It also agrees to facilitate a prompt start for the CDM and to invite nominations for membership of the executive board prior to COP-7 with a view to electing members at that session. On the CDM executive board, the text states that the board shall comprise ten members with one from each UN regional group, two others from Annex I Parties, two others from non-Annex I Parties, and one representative of SIDS.",
      "The board shall develop and recommend to COP-8 simplified modalities and procedures for small- scale CDM project activities on: renewable energy projects with a maximum output capacity equivalent of up to 15 megawatts; energy efficiency improvement projects that reduce energy consumption on the supply and/or demand side by up to the equivalent of 18 gigawatthours per year; or other projects that both reduce anthropogenic emissions by sources and directly emit less that 15 kilotonnes of CO2 equivalent. On sinks in the CDM, the COP agrees that afforestation and reforestation shall be the only eligible LULUCF projects under the CDM during the first commitment period, with implementation of these projects guided by the LULUCF principles defined elsewhere in the annex and by the definitions and modalities developed by SBSTA for decision at COP-8 including on non-permanence, additionality, leakage, scale uncertainties, and socio-economic and environmental impacts.",
      "LULUCF activities under the CDM in future commitment periods are to be decided in negotiations on the second commitment period."
