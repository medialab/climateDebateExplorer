      "This group met in morning and evening sessions to continue deliberations on the Co-Chairs` draft conclusions.",
      "Several delegates opposed Co-Chair David Warrilow`s suggestion that Parties compile a list of provisional work-programme elements.",
      "They stressed that before considering text on a work programme, agreement was needed on whether to address scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of adaptation and mitigation in one or two SBSTA agenda items, and on the elements of the proposed work programme.",
      "TUVALU, supported by AOSIS, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and SWITZERLAND, suggested deleting reference to a 'work programme' and replacing it with 'elements for future SBSTA work.",
      "' The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU, JAPAN and US, questioned the utility of inter-sessional consultations on the TAR prior to SBSTA-19.",
      "AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND and the US said adaptation and mitigation could be considered as separate agenda items.",
      "CANADA, the EU, JAPAN and SWITZERLAND, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, preferred to consider adaptation and mitigation under one agenda item.",
      "Participants then discussed how adaptation and mitigation would be considered in practice if these two issues were to be included in one agenda item. AUSTRALIA, CANADA, the EU, JAPAN and NEW ZEALAND, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, stressed the importance of considering cross-cutting elements and the integration of adaptation and mitigation.",
      "CANADA and SWITZERLAND supported a proposal made by New Zealand requesting SBSTA to explore the scientific, technological and socioeconomic aspects of how adaptation and mitigation each link to other issues, such as sustainable development and UNFCCC Article 2 (objective).",
      "CANADA, the EU, RUSSIAN FEDERATION and US underscored the importance of the timing of SBSTA activities. SAUDI ARABIA noted that elements of future SBSTA work should exclude adaptive and mitigative capacity, but include spill-over effects.",
      "The EU suggested including, inter alia, no regrets mitigation options and the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations.",
      "The US opposed developing a list of specific programme elements.",
      "Co-Chair David Warrilow said he would hold informal consultations with several Parties."
