      "Definitive judgments on the future of the FCCC process are difficult to make, given the mixed signals emanating from COP-2.",
      "The challenge facing the subsidiary bodies will be to produce a negotiating text that can reconcile divergent interests and maintain credibility and effectiveness.",
      "In environmental negotiations the measure of a successful compromise is primarily a measure of its effectiveness in bringing about the desired and sustainable outcome.",
      "A compromise per se is not an option and not necessarily a solution.",
      "The AGBM will test to the limits the UN system`s ability to broker a deal between those States prepared to invest in a post-fossil fuel era and those who stand to lose on their investment in business as usual.",
      "In these terms COP-3`s significance will be immense. The fulfillment of the Berlin Mandate - set against the failure of most Annex I Parties to fulfill their voluntary commitments under the existing FCCC - will be a significant measure of the degree to which the international community has marshaled the political will required to build on its commitment to sustainable development since UNCED.",
      "The debate on the AGBM will continue to spill over into the entire COP process, with Parties unlikely to give way on vital issues including the effectively-engineered dispute over the rules of procedure until the Berlin Mandate`s fate - together with the future of the global climate system - begins to take shape."
