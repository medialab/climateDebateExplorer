      "In a meeting of the informal group on LDCs held late afternoon, Chair Sibusiso Gamede (South Africa) reported on consultations held in the morning on guidelines on NAPAs.",
      "While noting progress, he said some Parties had proposed enlisting more expert assistance on the guidelines, and indicated that discussions would resume Friday. Delegates then considered a draft proposal by the LDC Group for a COP decision on the establishment of an LDC expert group, including an annex containing terms of reference for the group.",
      "A number of Annex I Parties raised concerns about the proposal, with the US and SWITZERLAND noting similar discussions taking place in the CGE group, and the EU suggesting that the groups might be combined at some point.",
      "Several LDCs highlighted the efficiency and value of an expert group in NAPA preparation and implementation.",
      "Delegates then discussed specific text in the proposed terms of reference on this expert group's mandate, with the EU, supported by other Annex I Parties, bracketing text relating to implementation of NAPAs."
