      "In the decision (FCCC/SBI/2007/L.26 Add.1), the COP emphasizes that the national communications and annual greenhouse gas inventories are the main sources of information for reviewing the implementation of the Convention by Annex I parties.",
      "It welcomes the work of the Secretariat in compiling and synthesizing the information and urges such parties that have not yet submitted their fourth communications to do so as a matter of priority.",
      "It requests Annex I parties to submit their fifth national communications by 1 January 2010 and decides to consider the date for the sixth national communications at COP 15.",
      "Report of national greenhouse gas inventory data for 1990-2005: On Tuesday, 4 December, the SBI plenary took note of the report (FCCC/SBI/2007/30).",
      "Status report of the review of the fourth national communications: On Tuesday, 4 December, the SBI plenary took note of the report (FCCC/SBI/2007/INF.8). NON-ANNEX I PARTIES ` NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS : Three issues were on the COP and SBI agendas relating to non-Annex I communications: the work of the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE), the provision of financial and technical support, and information contained in non-Annex I communications.",
      "As at previous meetings, the G-77/China objected to discussing the item on information contained in non-Annex I communications and the item was therefore held in abeyance and ultimately placed on the provisional agenda for consideration at SBI 28.",
      "Consultative Group of Experts (CGE): This item (FCCC/SBI/2007/10/Add.1, FCCC/SBI/2007/20, 27 and 28, FCCC/SBI/2007/MISC.7) was taken up in SBI plenary on 4 December, in a contact group co-chaired by Kristin Tilley (Australia) and Arthur Rolle (Bahamas), and in a series of informal consultations.",
      "Discussions focused on the new mandate for the CGE.",
      "The US and other Umbrella Group countries stressed the need for a new and different mandate.",
      "The US, supported by others, also proposed that CGE be mandated to examine non-Annex I national communications.",
      "Brazil, for the G-77/China, opposed this and any attempted linkage with the agenda item on the review of non-Annex I communications that was being held in abeyance.",
      "No agreement was reached by the time the SBI closing plenary was held on 11 December, when Canada, the EU and the G-77/China expressed disappointment at the outcome.",
      "Informal consultations on this issue continued until 14 December but no agreement was reached.",
      "The COP took note of the outcome in its closing plenary."
