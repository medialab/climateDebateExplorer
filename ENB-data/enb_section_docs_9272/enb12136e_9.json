      "Some participants have said they will be watching with interest the upcoming meeting of the EU Council of Ministers for clearer indications of the Union's negotiating positions on some of the key issues raised at SB-12.",
      "Several observers have expressed frustration at the EU's performance during the SB-12 discussions, noting an apparent setback on policies and measures and a lack of coherence, which contrasts with that of the Umbrella Group.",
      "Others have suggested that any perceived loss of ground at this stage in the negotiating process is overstated, and that a verdict on the Union's performance is premature prior to the Ministerial meeting, which will take important decisions such as those on sinks and nuclear power."
