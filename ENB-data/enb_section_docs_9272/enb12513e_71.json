      "This item (FCCC/SBI/2011/6 and Add.1) was first considered by the SBI plenary on 9 June.",
      "It includes agenda sub-items on COP 17, COP/MOP 7, future sessional periods, organization of the intergovernmental process and observer organizations in the intergovernmental process.",
      "It was subsequently considered in a contact group chaired by SBI Chair Owen-Jones.",
      "Discussion focused on: organization of the intergovernmental process for COP 17; the possibility of convening an intersessional meeting between Bonn and Durban; and enhancing the engagement of observers.",
      "On convening an intersessional meeting between Bonn and Durban, views were divided on the utility and format of such a meeting.",
      "Some parties maintained that holding this meeting would be contingent on progress in Bonn.",
      "Bangladesh, for the G-77/China, supported a short meeting of only the AWGs.",
      "Australia, Switzerland, the US and the EU proposed considering creative ways of ensuring that work progresses productively, including meetings of expert groups, which could focus on issues that require more substantive work.",
      "The US called for considering the costs and benefits of an additional session.",
      "On enhancing observer participation, parties reflected on the views and recommendations expressed in the in-session workshop on observer participation.",
      "Australia noted a clear sense that the UNFCCC process benefits from the participation of observers and could benefit from enhanced observer engagement.",
      "He urged parties to consider the conclusions outlined in the workshop report.",
      "For a summary of the workshop, see: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12505e.html.",
      "During consideration of draft conclusions on the means of enhancing observer organizations engagement, views were divided on guidance to the facilitators of informal consultations to propose that the meetings be open to observers when they consider that this would not impede negotiations.",
      "Saudi Arabia, India, and Antigua and Barbuda suggested deleting the text or revising the language, noting that this is the current practice and there is no need to reflect it in SBI conclusions.",
      "Australia supported retaining the reference, saying its inclusion would not imply changing the current rules, but rather, provide guidance to facilitators.",
      "He proposed alternative text recognizing the existing rule to close the meetings to observers when required.",
      "On a request to the Secretariat to facilitate interventions by observer organizations without advance submission of written copies, Saudi Arabia objected, noting this should be possible only in exceptional circumstances.",
      "On a request to the Secretariat to enable the replacement of names of nominated representatives of admitted observer organizations during the meeting in the online registration system, Saudi Arabia opposed, underscoring the need to maintain the current six-day time requirement, except for exceptional circumstances.",
      "During the SBI closing plenary on 16 June, the meeting was suspended when Saudi Arabia and the US identified the need for further work on language on observer participation.",
      "After further consultations, parties agreed to recommend that, in cases where there is no contact group on an agenda item, at least the first and last informal meetings can be open to observers, while recognizing the right of parties to keep informal meetings closed.",
      "Saudi Arabia and Antigua and Barbuda, opposed by Mexico, Australia and Colombia, proposed that examination of options for new channels for observer organizations to provide inputs to the COP and COP/MOP be deferred to SBI 36 instead of SBI 35.",
      "Parties eventually agreed to defer the consideration of the issue to SBI 36 and the SBI adopted the conclusions as amended.",
      "Many parties expressed support for the enhanced engagement of observers.",
      "Australia, the Cook Islands and Grenada also welcomed the upcoming UNFCCC special event on observer participation at COP 17.",
      "The SBI adopted conclusions on 16 June."
