      "AUSTRIA, with support from GERMANY, BELGIUM, and others, proposed the addition of a new section in the SPM, which notes that there are gaps in knowledge regarding some aspects of CCS, and that increasing knowledge and experience would reduce uncertainties and facilitate decision making.",
      "Delegates agreed to the proposal. What is CCS and how could it contribute to mitigating climate change?",
      "After a report from NORWAY on the work of a contact group established on Thursday, delegates agreed to text for the opening section of the SPM.",
      "The agreed text states that CCS is an option in the portfolio of mitigation actions for stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations, and that the TAR indicates that no single technology option will provide all of the reductions."
