      "At the morning briefing convened by the AGBM Chair Ra\u00fal Estrada-Oyuela, industry and environmental NGOs were invited to prepare comments on a number of contentious issues. The Chair of the non-group on policies and measures, Bakary Kante (Senegal), reported that consensus had been reached on cooperation among Parties, with some conditions.",
      "There has been a clear statement of views on the issue of coordinated and mandatory policies and measures but it will be difficult, for the time being, to reach consensus.",
      "A number of 'very nice' formulations have been placed in brackets.",
      "No consensus emerged on the issue of compensation, so this will also go forward to the AGBM Chair unresolved. Chair Estrada invited industry NGOs to consider the question of whether the Parties should try to agree mandatory policies and measures, with all countries acting on the same general policies coordinated at intergovernmental level, and convey their views to the AGBM plenary Thursday morning.",
      "An industry spokesman concurred and indicated that business favors implementation at country-level to take account of national economic and energy profiles. The Chair of the non-group on FCCC Article 4.1 reported that a text has been adopted after a constructive round of meetings that cleared a reasonable amount of text.",
      "Two 'hard core' issues will demand the attention of the AGBM Chair.",
      "These are: general commitments applicable to all Parties to achieve mitigation and adaptation measures; and transfer of environmentally sound technology.",
      "Chair Estrada invited developing country NGOs to present short comments on these issues.",
      "The non-group Chair welcomed Parties` readiness to resolve the issue of means of implementation (Article 12) although some technical items remain in brackets. The Chair of the non-group on institutions and mechanisms, Takao Shibata (Japan), was invited to comment on the legal status of the proposed Attachment 1 to register Parties` commitments.",
      "He reported a divergence of views, with many delegations concerned about the amendment procedure that would apply to the Attachment.",
      "He indicated that the outcome of discussions will be linked to the nature of the commitments. Bo Kjell\u00e9n (Sweden) reported on the QELROs-2 non-group.",
      "There has been near total agreement on reporting and review (Article 8).",
      "On voluntary commitments (Article 10), he reported that the G-77 has taken a negative line and Norway is chairing a working group.",
      "On review of adequacy of commitments (Article 11), Chair Kjell\u00e9n said he will be conducting consultations on a bilateral basis and circulating his own draft text.",
      "A contact group involving the EU, the US, and others is considering emissions trading, and consultations are also planned on joint implementation.",
      "Chair Estrada announced that the AGBM Plenary will convene Thursday to begin the process of finishing the AGBM`s work, followed by closed meetings."
