      "Erik Haites, Margaree Consultants, Inc., provided an introduction to emissions trading.",
      "He discussed how emissions trading would reduce costs and noted his assumption that allowances would be allocated to participants at no charge.",
      "An emitter with low control costs can reduce its emissions below the quantity allocated and sell the extra permits.",
      "If the market price is higher than the cost of reducing the emissions, it earns income from the extra reductions.",
      "An emitter with high control costs that needs additional allowances can buy surplus permits from other sources.",
      "If the market price is less than the cost of controlling emissions at its own facilities, it saves money. Regarding compliance, he noted that each participating source must hold allowances equal to its actual emissions and that accurate monitoring and reporting of actual emissions is essential for environmental integrity.",
      "Like any environmental regulation, compliance must be enforced if the environmental goal is to be achieved.",
      "Haites noted that penalties for non- compliance must exceed the financial gains from non-compliance.",
      "This could require loss of permits plus financial penalties.",
      "To work well, emissions trading requires a competitive market for the allowances, which means a large number of buyers and sellers with no single buyer accounting for a large share of total purchases.",
      "He concluded that GHGs are well suited to emissions trading from an environmental perspective and the potential cost savings are large (50 to 80%).",
      "The main issues outstanding in implementing Article 17 are: liability arrangements to provide an incentive for compliance; possible market power by a large buyer or seller; implementation of supplementarity provisions; and treatment of 'hot air.",
      "' Question and Answer Session: Discussion in this session covered a range of issues, including: the participation of legal entities and non-state actors; entitlements to credits; fungibility of CDM credits; supplementarity; and reporting requirements.",
      "Participants also addressed providing incentives for compliance, rather than penalties for non-compliance.",
      "In response to a question regarding participation of non-State actors in the trading regime, Haites said that legal entities would participate in two ways, as brokers or as buyers and sellers.",
      "Another participant noted that if legal entities are excluded, there would only be 39 Parties to trade.",
      "A business representative stressed the importance of the issue for industry and requested its inclusion in the agenda for the upcoming subsidiary bodies meeting. One participant raised questions regarding the basis for the determination of holdings of allowances for emissions trading and stressed that the speaker`s presentation had presumed certain holdings and ownerships.",
      "He noted that the Protocol includes the concept of market based mechanisms, but this does not imply a creation of the requisite right to hold such allowances for the purposes of exchanges.",
      "Another participant noted that assigned amounts have been indicated as provisional rights and questioned if this is morally correct.",
      "This approach puts polluters in the position to make money, even though they are the ones responsible for the problem.",
      "The speaker said the reductions should be characterized as 'savings' rather than 'profits.",
      "' One participant asked if the 50-80% savings figure cited by Haites assumed that the CDM is fungible with other mechanisms.",
      "If so, that would increase global demand for CDM projects, since they would generate tradable reductions.",
      "Concerning fungibility, one observer noted that Protocol Articles 3.10 and 3.11 allow Annex I countries to acquire CERs from the CDM, but do not imply that they would be transferred again.",
      "With emissions trading, he said the fungibility issue should be treated carefully.",
      "Participants also asked: if the speaker assumed the prices were the same with or without supplementarity; if compliance costs would go down in the second period because of increased investments; and whether the speaker envisaged a yearly stocktaking and, if so, whether countries would be required to reduce by a certain amount each year. One participant inquired about the leading models for forecasting and the possibility of the COP placing them on-line to reflect changes in markets to enable better decisions by Parties.",
      "Another noted that emissions trading is intended to cut costs for Annex B countries subject to supplementary, and questioned the need for trading on a global scale.",
      "Noting that CDM activities could begin in the year 2000 while Article 6 activities could not, one participant questioned whether the model took into account the difference between the mechanisms.",
      "He said the difference affects competitiveness, fungibility and comparative advantage between mechanisms.",
      "The speaker noted that the time frames would affect the market mechanisms and noted that most models operate on five- and ten-year time frames.",
      "Recalling that there is to be sharing of proceeds for CDM, one participant asked what that sharing will entail, what the link between the two mechanisms is and how non-Annex I Parties would trade them.",
      "Questions were also raised on compliance reserves, an annual surrender and eligibility requirements for trading. Designing an appropriate international framework for emissions trading, including verification reporting and accountability issues: Jan Corfee-Morlot, OECD, discussed monitoring, reporting and review under the Protocol and focussed on: Article 3, which provides elements of the accounting system that allows a country to choose a base year other than 1990; Article 5, which sets out monitoring requirements and identifies IPCC methods with the possibility of 'appropriate adjustments' to be used for monitoring; Article 7 on reporting to demonstrate compliance, which calls for annual inventories, periodic communication and supplemental information to demonstrate how to ensure compliance; and Article 8 on the review to assess implementation, which calls for expert review of national inventories and communications. She said that national systems for inventories provide a basis for review and should result in quality information to establish compliance and assessment.",
      "Aggregate national inventories that will show the performance of Parties would only be available by the end of the first commitment period.",
      "She stated that the interpretation of Article 5.1 (national inventories) should be closely linked to the 'good practice' work of the IPCC, which consists of elements on: institutional arrangements; choice of methods for GHG estimation; data collection procedures; and expert review, evaluation of uncertainty, quality assessment and control. Annie Petsonk, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), presented case studies and practical experience in reporting, verification and accountability.",
      "She said that environmental markets at international and national levels could improve environmental performance through compliance with total emissions limitation requirements, as well as cut costs and provide flexibility.",
      "She said that emissions trading and related market instruments can drive entrepreneurial forces towards innovation of cheaper, faster and better ways for emissions reductions and preserve full sovereign discretion. She identified the key elements in constructing reporting, verification and accountability systems as: promoting measurements to design systems that encourage quality, integrity, fungibility, consistent rules that do not change radically without prior notice, and transparency.",
      "She addressed types of verification in general and as required for the Protocol, and noted that self-verification or verification through market systems such as ISO 14000 were insufficient, as the Protocol will require independent verification of total emissions performance. She detailed accountability rules whereby a country that exceeds its assigned amounts can: have deductions made from the next budget year; have automatic mandatory discounting of all non- tendered assigned amount units (AAUs) transferred; or Parties can meet and decide on a penalty for the non-complying country. Question and Answer Session: The discussions centered on the feasibility of accountability rules for non-complying parties, the time lag in provision of emissions information, crediting of early action schemes and the applicability of experiences drawn from emissions trading in SO2 reduction. One participant noted the difficulty of reporting national emissions in the absence of a mechanism that retires a portion of assigned amounts on a regular basis, or without considering buyer liability to encourage countries to purchase carefully.",
      "He questioned the value of such reports considering that emissions data comes two years after the year in question and possibly after the budget period is over.",
      "Regarding whether the accountability rules that require deduction of excess emissions from the second budget period, a number of participants inquired whether the second budget period commitments would have to be negotiated before the first budget period.",
      "In response, attention was drawn to the fact that the Kyoto Protocol calls on Parties to start consideration of the second budget period in 2005. One participant said a compliance regime that is mainly based on a system of borrowing from future commitments may reduce mutual confidence between Parties as it would allow Parties to indefinitely postpone emissions reductions.",
      "Another participant stressed the need to look at compliance issues associated with mechanisms separately from compliance with targets in the Protocol.",
      "The problem of early crediting of activities that may not receive COP/MOP approval was also raised.",
      "Petsonk stressed the need for rigorous accountability of emissions and transfers if trading is to start early. Design Options for Emissions Trading, Including Verification, Reporting and Accountability Issues - Panel I: Peter Bohm, Stockholm University, focused on market power, supplementarity and 'hot air.",
      "' He discussed whether efficient emissions trading is threatened by market power by using a 'worst case' example, wherein a single buyer determines all his purchases at a single market price in a period.",
      "The buyer then withholds demand and thus lowers the price.",
      "This results in an inefficiently small trade volume, where the sellers lose and the buyers win.",
      "He said that significant use of buyer or seller market power is unlikely in continuous emissions trading among governments and that even an attempt to exert market power was unlikely.",
      "Regarding binding supplementarity, he noted that abandoning free trade raises the aggregate cost for attaining the emissions reductions agreed in Kyoto.",
      "It could also reduce Parties` willingness to make stringent commitments for future periods and reduce the willingness of new countries to join Annex B.",
      "On the other hand, binding supplementarity would mean higher carbon emissions prices in buyer countries that would stimulate the development of new and less costly abatement techniques. Michael Grubb, Royal Institute of International Affairs, discussed liability, supplementarity and other issues in emissions trading.",
      "Regarding accountability in international emissions trading, he noted the need to separate the question of governmental commitments from the need to include industries.",
      "The system of accountability could work if the COP/MOP only considers government actions and governments individually determine how they will involve industry.",
      "The COP/MOP must make sure the government-to-government component is valid and credible.",
      "He said that the opponents of supplementarity, or constraints on imports of reductions, argue that such a policy would raise the costs of compliance in the first commitment period.",
      "He thought the arguments for supplementarity were stronger and stated that it encourages more consistent leadership by richer countries, puts their emissions on declining trajectories, and induces greater innovation.",
      "He presented options for implementing supplementarity: establishing a 'concrete ceiling' on the percentage of a Party`s assigned amount that can be imported; defining a non-binding guideline; making imports conditional on the adoption of specified policies and measures; and allowing imports related to an assessment of aggregate impact of domestic policies and measures. Question and Answer Session: Many of the questions focused on, inter alia, the treatment and impact of 'hot air' on the Kyoto Protocol process and the costs of technology.",
      "In response to questions regarding 'hot air,' Grubb reiterated that negotiators should consider its overall impact on the Kyoto process.",
      "He questioned what would happen if an allocation proves to be excessive when compared with the 'business as usual' projection and the country`s emissions had naturally decreased to 80% of the 1990 levels.",
      "Could the country sell that 20% allowance that was never needed?",
      "One participant questioned the assumption that prohibiting trade in 'hot air' would result in it being banked and remaining available.",
      "She said this incorrectly assumes that delegates would not take this excess into account when negotiating the second round of targets.",
      "Other participants asked: if 'hot air' would be addressed by Protocol Article 3.6, which allows flexibility in implementation for EIT countries; what counts as a climate-related policy that lowers emissions and what counts as 'hot air;' and should Parties develop a legally-agreed definition for the concept of 'hot air.",
      "' One participant proposed dealing with 'hot air' by allowing JI to begin early, but beginning the actual emissions accounting in the commitment period itself. One participant called for a focus on the implications of transfers and noted that, if one assumes that all offsets are used by other Annex I Parties, the transfers would amount to about US$40 billion a year and would exceed four times the current level of FDI.",
      "Grubb noted the importance of numbers for providing a quantitative perspective, but cautioned against relying heavily on them since the models need further work.",
      "He noted there was a possibility that the costs may turn out to be much lower than indicated by the models and said the history of energy forecasting has been unreliable. Design options for emissions trading, including verification, reporting, accountability and liability issues - Panel II: In his presentation 'Registries - A basic building block for the success of the Kyoto Protocol,' Edward Helm, Center for Clean Air Policy, detailed the use of data reviews, expert reviews and inventories in keeping track of all transactions between Parties, between legal entities, and between entities and Parties.",
      "He stressed that these were basic, technical and non- controversial elements of the Protocol monitoring and compliance system that can track and provide information on AAU transfers, regardless of what system of emissions reduction a country or the COP chooses. He described the working of the registry and noted that it provides public information to facilitate and increase the integrity of trading and help minimize compliance costs.",
      "He distinguished between compliance accounts for those liable to meet targets with given allowances and general accounts for brokers who have no liabilities but hold allowances for companies or are involved in trading transactions.",
      "Regarding who will operate the registries, he said that a secretariat or private contractor would operate a single international computerized registry.",
      "He stressed the need for consistency and compatibility between all the registry systems.",
      "In conclusion, he underscored the importance of registries in facilitating the development of emissions markets by: providing evidence that a seller has AAUs for sale; identifying who has AAUs; indicating the level of trading activity; and encouraging the development of better data systems. Frank Joshua, UNCTAD, presented an overview of the 'Plurilateral GHG Emissions Trading System' project.",
      "The aim of the project is to promote consistency between domestic trading programmes with the international emissions trading system by enabling sharing of experiences on relevant international aspects of emissions trading programmes, strengthening coordination among domestic emissions trading programmes and providing training and capacity building.",
      "He stressed the need for coherence and consistency in the way domestic programmes evolve and the work of the COP.",
      "He identified three approaches to GHG emissions trading: the multilateral approach; the bilateral approach, based on the establishment of a series of domestic programmes in a number of countries and on related bilateral trading agreements; and the commercial approach based on private commercial agreements.",
      "He said that it was essential to understand the links between domestic programmes and how they might affect the multilateral system.",
      "He stated that the challenge to be addressed in the UNCTAD project is to identify the key international aspects of domestic emissions trading systems. Question and Answer Session: Discussions centered on the expected outputs of the UNCTAD project, the implications of domestic emissions regimes on the design of an international emissions trading system and the inclusion of pricing information in registries.",
      "One participant sought clarification on the use of the results.",
      "Joshua said these are meant to facilitate the negotiation process and would be made available to governments to use as they wish. Regarding registries, participants inquired about the reason for not including information on prices noting that such information may be advantageous to governments.",
      "In response, Helm stated that governments may choose to include pricing information.",
      "Another participant said that choosing not to provide pricing information could conceal situations whereby governments provide subsidies under the cover of emissions reduction.",
      "It was mentioned that prices may not be transparent where there is devolution in terms of trading and, that even if disclosed, uncertainty will remain as to the whether they represent the actual prices. Design options for emissions trading, including verification, reporting, accountability and liability issues - Panel III: Nick Aldridge, International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), focused on the role, features and benefits of exchanges, which he defined as 'safe places' that trade standard contracts.",
      "For emissions trading, they could, inter alia, define the carbon unit and permit, how it will be delivered and how rights are transferred.",
      "There are two types of trading: open outcry, which involves face-to-face trades; and electronic trading, which is conducted over computer networks and allows a far wider audience to access the market.",
      "Exchanges are 'safe' because most are regulated by law and can employ sanctions, such as fines and suspension of trading rights.",
      "Exchanges can be used to trade futures and options, as well as spot transactions (such as power exchanges and natural gas hubs) and can also provide price risk management and trading.",
      "The benefits of exchanges include risk management, price discovery, supply pricing flexibility, liquidity and no counter party risk.",
      "It also offers global access, which would be important for emissions trading and imposes no barriers to entry.",
      "He stated that as soon as a framework is established, IPE would launch emissions futures. Garth Edwards, Natsource, discussed the role of the broker in emissions trading.",
      "The broker matches the buyer and seller, and finds the right price, quantity and settlement terms for counter parties.",
      "The broker also develops a transaction structure that reduces price risk and helps capture opportunity.",
      "Regarding the market for GHG emissions, Edwards said there are an increasing number of transactions and major portfolios being developed.",
      "He said that GHG transactions are essentially an insurance policy for emitters.",
      "He described the current state of GHG trading activity including North American transactions and portfolio building and internal trading by BP, Royal Dutch Shell and others.",
      "Current sellers, from Annex B, include companies engaged in landfill/coal mine methane capture, fuel switching or re- powering, capacity upgrades and plant efficiency improvements.",
      "Other sellers include CDM projects related to forest sequestration and renewable energy and JI projects.",
      "Current bids to buy are from Annex B emitters, such as power generators and marketers, chemical industries, steel, metal and cement producers. Question and Answer Session: Discussion centered on buyer and seller liability, the nature and origin of credits that will be traded and the range of contingencies involved in transactions.",
      "Regarding Annex B offers to sell, one participant asked what basis they had for 'putting credits out for sale.",
      "' Edwards clarified that what is being bought is the right to claim credit at a later stage.",
      "Credits are sold in anticipation of an assigned amount by a government.",
      "Some producers predict they will not be exempt from having to make reductions.",
      "Others may think that they have a strong claim to credits to offer.",
      "One participant asked for clarification as to what would be exchanged: emissions allowances in the context of Article 17 and/or credits generated under CDM and JI projects.",
      "She noted that buyer liability is written into Article 6 of the Protocol and added that buyers will have uncertainty as to whether the Party from whom credit is bought will be in compliance at the end of the commitment period.",
      "Another participant recommended re-reading the Protocol, because it consistently refers to commitments, which are obligations to be fulfilled at some point in the future. One participant asked whether buyer liability increases the transaction costs, if it would create a disincentive to trade and whether markets could deal with uncertainties at an acceptable cost.",
      "Aldridge replied that if the international process results in a 'buyer beware' situation, buyers would not trade.",
      "Edwards expected buyers to trade on such a basis, but said the process would become more complicated.",
      "Many participants questioned whether buyer liability would deter trading and debated whether all traders systemically incur liability when engaging in a foreign transaction.",
      "Aldridge noted that much trading is done anonymously, but said that a company with poor credit limits and consistent defaults would not be allowed to trade at an exchange.",
      "It was noted that several countries have had serious economic problems this year, but because the sovereign debt is weaker, it does not add to the transaction costs when trading in debts.",
      "Edwards noted that in a perfect world the price would not increase, but that GHG markets are not the same as debt markets.",
      "Currently, the GHG buyer has to spend a lot of time investigating the product, whereas with debt such information can be found easily. Special Session on registries for emissions trading: Peter Also, New Zealand Ministry of Commerce, and Jennifer Macedonia, US EPA, outlined a possible GHG registry and discussed its background, purpose and system design.",
      "The registry would keep track of adjustments to initial assigned amounts in order to determine compliance at the end of the commitment period.",
      "It would also provide publicly accessible information to facilitate and maintain integrity of trading and promote transparency.",
      "The basic structure would employ a computer database that contains accounts for all holdings of: assigned amount acquired or transferred through emissions trading; CERs generated from CDM projects; ERUs acquired or transferred through joint implementation; and increases or decreases of carbon stocks.",
      "A tradable unit would be one metric tonne of CO2 equivalent emissions with a unique serial number.",
      "There would be at least one account for the Party`s holding at the government level.",
      "The registry would track official changes to the holdings.",
      "The experts also presented a registry prototype that illustrated how an entity-to-entity transfer would work."
