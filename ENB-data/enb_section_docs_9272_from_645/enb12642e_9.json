      "At mid-point in the week-long meeting, some delegates welcomed \"small, but meaningful movements\" in discussions on adaptation, capacity building, transparency, and joint implementation under mitigation.",
      "Yet, even this rather muted enthusiasm did not spread evenly across all the facilitated groups, with some commenting that the inevitable \"binary issues\" keep coming up as soon as negotiators scratch the surface of substance.",
      "The stocktaking session mirrored frustrations, with groups looking upon the first days with regret and to the rest of the week with trepidation.",
      "Many noted the lack of bridging proposals and were surprised at returning to \"storytelling and concept clarifying,\" while others lamented procedural debates.",
      "Although most called for guidance on how work should progress, one delegate called for countries to engage with each other, reprimanding, \"we should not blame each other, but ourselves.\" With continued lack of clarity on how to use the Co-Chairs\u00a7 Tool, many left deeply concerned over the pace of negotiations when only seven negotiating days are left before what Co-Chair Ahmed Djoghlaf called negotiators\u00a7 \"date with history.\""
