      "Dovland stressed that the task in 2008 is to analyze and reach conclusions on means to reach emission reduction targets, including flexible mechanisms, LULUCF, a basket of greenhouse gases and covered sectors.",
      "Parties adopted the agenda ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/1 ).",
      "Switzerland, for the Environmental Integrity Group, highlighted linkages between the AWGs and the need for cooperation.",
      "During the Monday morning plenary, country groups delivered opening statements.",

      "Samoa, for AOSIS, said greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations must be stabilized well below 450 parts per million (ppm) and suggested the inclusion of new gases under the Protocol.",
      "New Zealand stated that rules must be improved and finalized before new commitments are made.",
      "China stressed that if the rules are changed, the 25-40% indicative range of Annex I emission reductions must be increased.",
      "Japan highlighted the potential of sectoral approaches in achieving global emission reductions, and New Zealand supported analyzing other types of commitments in addition to quantified targets.",

      "Tuvalu suggested auctioning Assigned Amount Units (AAUs).",
      "The Climate Action Network stressed that emission reductions in industrial sectors should not be substituted with emission reductions in other sectors, such as LULUCF, and stressed the need to protect biodiversity and indigenous rights.",
      "The International Trade Union Confederation called on parties to consider social and economic dimensions of emission reduction targets."
