      "On Wednesday, delegates discussed freshwater resources and their management.",
      "Concerning water runoff and water availability, the main issues discussed included a draft map showing changes in runoff, and the inclusion of numerical figures.",
      "Algeria, China, Ghana, Mali and others questioned a map that showed a high increase in water runoff in the Sahara.",
      "Co-Chair Parry explained that since the map showed percentage increases, the change appeared significant in a dry region although runoff remained low.",
      "The Lead Authors explained that models do not provide consistent projections for the Sahara, which is why the area could have been masked in the water run-off map.",
      "However, they had preferred to provide a projection by using the mean value of 19 studies.",
      "Co-Chair Parry said alternatives included a map showing millimeter per day changes or omitting the map.",
      "The Russian Federation, South Africa, Togo and others emphasized the importance of having a map.",
      "Consideration of the map continued informally.",
      "On Thursday afternoon, a new map was introduced showing changes in millimeters per day.",
      "Mali proposed deleting it, but was opposed by Austria, Australia, Switzerland, Spain, South Africa, Syria and others.",
      "Agreement was not reached and the final SPM contains no map on water runoff.",
      "India and Saudi Arabia expressed concern over numbers projecting increases and decreases in water availability and runoff, and questioned their scientific basis.",
      "Benin, France, Sudan and others preferred keeping them.",
      "The agreed text retains the figures estimating 10-40% increases in some areas, and 10-30% decreases in others.",
      "Other questions discussed in this context included reference to East and Southeast Asia and other regions, differences between dry and monsoon seasons and inclusion of likelihood statements.",
      "On a statement noting increase in drought-affected areas and flood risk and their negative consequences on sustainable development, WGII agreed to refer only to increased frequency of precipitation events and not to increased intensity.",
      "The US called for making clear links between the SPM and the underlying chapters, emphasizing the need for traceability of statements in the SPM. WGII agreed to remove reference to the implications of increased floods and droughts for sustainable development.",
      "Delegates did not agree to proposals to include a new paragraph on sustainable development.",
      "Argentina asked to have it on the record that this SPM section has shortcomings on water pollution."
