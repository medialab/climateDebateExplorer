      "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2014/L.10), the SBSTA, inter alia : - encourages parties to draw on submissions, the technical synthesis and the report on the workshop; - notes its work on this matter is being conducted without prejudice to the work of the ADP on the 2015 agreement and pre-2020 ambition; - notes the willingness of parties to share information relevant to the design and operation of market-based approaches and non-market-based approaches, and invites further submissions, by 22 September 2014, without prejudging the use or recognition of these approaches under the Convention and its instruments; - suggests that these submissions address, inter alia , whether and how approaches meet standards that are comparable to standards under the UNFCCC, enable the accounting, at the international level, of mitigation outcomes, allow for participation, including through possible eligibility criteria, provide co-benefits, including their contribution to sustainable development, poverty eradication and adaptation, have effective institutional arrangements and governance, and relate to international agreements; and - requests a technical paper from the Secretariat for consideration at SBSTA 41 on how approaches may address these issues.",
      "Non-Market-Based Approaches: This issue was considered in the SBSTA on 4 June, and in subsequent informal consultations co-facilitated by Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Mandy Rambharos (South Africa)."
