   "sentences": [
      "Opening the stocktaking plenary, COP/CMP President Korolec described work under the COP and CMP as progressing smoothly, and drew attention to finance as an area where 'significant progress' has been made and where efforts need to be continued. SBSTA Chair Muyungi informed parties that the SBSTA has successfully concluded, having adopted 15 conclusions.",
      "He indicated parties were unable to conclude three items, which will be forwarded to the COP/CMP President: REDD+ institutional arrangements (joint SBI/SBSTA item); response measures forum and work programme (joint SBI/SBSTA item); and methodological issues under the Protocol relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8.",
      "He noted two items on which no progress was made: report of the TEC and CTCN (joint SBI/SBSTA item); and market and non-market mechanisms, which will be taken up by SBSTA 40. SBI Chair Chruszczow announced that the SBI closed and explained that while important steps had been taken, outstanding issues remained, including: REDD+ institutional arrangements; response measures; loss and damage; and the budget for the biennium 2014-2015.",
      "He reported that parties expressed diverging views on whether consideration of the report of the TEC and CTCN should be forwarded to SBI 40 or COP 19, and remitted this matter to the COP President. ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger reported that draft decision text has been circulated and will be considered in the afternoon.",
      "President Korolec asked the SBI and SBSTA Chairs to continue work on outstanding issues and report to him on Tuesday, 19 November; and announced that Ministers Bomo Edna Molewa (South Africa) and Lena Margareta Ek (Sweden) would assist him on loss and damage.",
      "Fiji, for the G-77/CHINA, requested that those SBSTA items that have not been completed should be allocated appropriate time under the COP and CMP.",
      "Switzerland, for the EIG, welcomed progress on, inter alia, REDD+, noting slow progress on: market mechanisms; budget; enabling decisions for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period; and loss and damage.",
      "Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, called for a strong signal from Warsaw that the ADP is on track to deliver, and said mitigation commitments from all will be necessary.",
      "He also highlighted progress on loss and damage.",
      "Bangladesh, for the LDCs, called for setting up an international mechanism on loss and damage in Warsaw, and lamented lack of agreement on the budget, calling for adaptation activities to be given high priority.",
      "Chile, for AILAC, called for progress on the development and transfer of technologies, and the implementation of the Technology Mechanism.",
      "Nauru, for AOSIS, urged reaching a decision on loss and damage.",
      "Papua New Guinea, for the COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS, said REDD+ is 'a package within reach' at COP 19.",
      "The EU called for concluding work on the budget for 2012-2013."
