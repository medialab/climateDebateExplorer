      "Chair Sadowski noted participants' comments that national circumstances are a significant factor in determining best or good practices, indicating that the most appropriate package of policies or measures will differ between and within countries.",
      "He noted that there had been no agreed view on what the criteria should be for determining best practices.",
      "He observed that the use of historical data and experience had been identified by some participants as being valuable in developing best practices.",
      "He said this session had focused primarily on the transport sector, and suggested that future workshops focus on the residential and commercial sectors.",
      "Further action could include: the establishment of an ongoing programme for exchange of experiences and information through workshops or other appropriate mechanisms; and the elaboration of criteria for identifying or assessing best practices."
