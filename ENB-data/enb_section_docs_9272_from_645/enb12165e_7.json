      "On the intervals between the comprehensive assessments, some countries favored longer intervals in order to have more new information to build on.",
      "One delegate suggested a 10-year interval with a supplement every five years with updates.",
      "Other participants supported maintaining the cycle at five years, noting that research is taking place at an accelerated speed.",
      "One participant wanted the interval to be shorter than five years.",
      "Several participants noted a sense of fatigue among scientists both with regard to the number of reports and the timing of the next assessment.",
      "Stressing that the supply of a high quality product must be ensured, one delegate said a new assessment should be should be issued only when there is something new to report, and suggested the scientists should be consulted about the timeframe. Chair Watson suggested that the timeframe would partly be determined by the amount of new material appearing in the near future, but also by the new Bureau."
