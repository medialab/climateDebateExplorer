      "Fernanda Zermoglio, SEI, presented this group s conclusions and recommendations including: developing an open dialogue between providers and users of information and data in order to balance specific data needs against other potential uses; developing guidance on the translation (analysis) of existing data to provide information relevant to climate change; and establishing appropriate channels to link the climate change policy community to leverage existing knowledge, data, experiences and networks.",
      "She also reported on the next steps that will be required, including identifying relevant actors such as universities, regional centers, national agencies, inter-agency national bodies, partnerships and grassroots organizations; and refining sector-specific data needs.",
      "Following Zermoglio s presentation, participants from this group also stressed: the role of regional organizations as translators of global information for developing countries needs; and the dangers of using the Designated National Authority model, including its tendency to marginalize adaptation planning from the development process."
