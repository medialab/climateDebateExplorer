      "INDIA preferred focusing on deliverables from Cancun and the future of the Kyoto Protocol which is highly threatened, stating that the AWG-KP progress is well behind the AWG-LCA.",
      "He also said that once the substance has been decided, the form will follow. CHINA acknowledged the importance of discussing legal issues, saying that an amendment to Protocol Annex B constitutes a legally-binding outcome under the Protocol track, and that a legally-binding outcome to strengthen the Convention s implementation is acceptable for his country.",

COP/MOP CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM (CDM): CDM Executive Board Chair Clifford Mahlung reported on the Board s work in 2010 (FCCC/KP/CMP/2010/10), highlighting achievements such as: the development and adoption of new procedures for registration, issuance and review, including timelines for each stage; elaboration of a loan scheme to assist countries with fewer than ten registered project activities; and elaboration of an appeals procedure against decisions of the Board.",
