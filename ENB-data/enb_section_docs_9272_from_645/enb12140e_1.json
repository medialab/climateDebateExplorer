      "Presentations: IPCC Chair Bob Watson said the first question relating to project-based activities was whether or not to include sinks in the CDM and, if they are included, which ones to allow.",
      "Sandra Brown, IPCC Lead Author, provided information on, inter alia: development of baselines, which can be project-specific or generic, and fixed or regularly updated; approaches to accounting for and mitigation of leakage; permanence; and measuring, monitoring and verification of selected pools.",
      "Watson noted that these issues must also be addressed in energy projects, while observing that the question of permanence is considered more difficult for LULUCF projects. Question-and-answer session: In the ensuing question-and- answer session, the EUROPEAN COMMISSION drew attention to the possibility of leakage having positive effects.",
      "In response to a question on leakage by the NETHERLANDS, Sandra Brown highlighted the development of 'look-up tables' for leakages covering different types of tree species and based on market supply and demand.",
      "The US underscored the distinction between the cost and price of carbon, and said there may be opportunities to sell at a significant profit.",
      "Brown stressed the current lack of a price, since there is no market and the only information available is on investment costs. In response to a question by the US on baselines, Brown said baselines in some existing projects are now being revisited to add field data.",
      "She noted that, with more projects, there will be added incentive and data to develop generic baselines.",
      "CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC queried what could be done to monitor small-scale projects in rural areas, and Brown said it was a question of encouraging cooperation at a local level, after which standard statistical sampling could be used.",
      "With regard to a possible minimum area size or carbon offset, she said several small projects could be bundled into larger ones. FINLAND drew attention to the complexity of the underlying causes of deforestation, highlighting structural and socio- economic factors, and questioned how much a project approach would actually address the wider problem of deforestation.",
      "Watson replied that, while it is important to identify the root cause and to change policy and institutional frameworks, projects could be of value and are the only feasible approach under the climate change framework. In response to a comment by the UK on the possibility of using sectoral baselines, Watson said this could be a viable option, although it required careful consideration.",
      "AOSIS noted the potential benefits of projects for indigenous peoples."
