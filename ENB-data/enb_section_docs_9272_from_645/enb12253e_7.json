      "This group was co-chaired by Bubu Jallow (the Gambia) and Ricardo Moita (Portugal).",
      "Delegates discussed guidance to the GEF on the LDC Fund and the LDC Expert Group (LEG).",
      "CANADA commended the LEG`s work, and TANZANIA, for the LDCs, proposed extending the LEG`s mandate to support the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs).",
      "On guidance to the GEF, LDCs, SAMOA and MALAWI expressed concern over co-financing requirements, noting that decision 6/CP.9 (guidance on the operation of the LDC Fund) provides for full funding of NAPAs.",
      "The GEF said that, since decision 6/CP.9 requires the GEF to develop criteria for full funding, some activities would qualify for full funding, while others would build on existing development projects and require co-financing from other sources, or in-kind contributions by recipient governments.",
      "The EU said co-financing emphasizes countries` sense of ownership over projects."
