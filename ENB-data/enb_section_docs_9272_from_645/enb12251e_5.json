      "ARGENTINA, with PANAMA, welcomed the pledges to the SCCF, but noted that these are insufficient for effectively supporting adaptation and disaster response.",
      "AOSIS, supported by the AFRICA GROUP, LDCs, NAMIBIA, CUBA and UGANDA, expressed concern over the interpretation of COP guidance by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), underlining that the most vulnerable countries face difficulty in accessing GEF funds due to the burden of co-financing requirements, the existence of additional criteria and indicators not adopted by the COP, and the narrow scope of adaptation projects eligible under the GEF.",
      "SWITZERLAND noted that the new criteria seek to simplify the incremental cost principle and the US welcomed the differentiation in criteria applied to the General Trust Fund and SCCF.",
      "SAMOA urged that more innovative approaches be used and that the COP, not the GEF, should determine eligibility criteria."
