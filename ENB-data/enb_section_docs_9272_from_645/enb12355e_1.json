      "Joel Smith, Stratus Consulting, provided an overview of the use of frameworks, methods and tools.",
      "He stated that the analysis of vulnerability and adaptation must be appropriate for the questions being asked, such as whether a system, region or village is vulnerable to climate change, as well as how vulnerabilities can be reduced through adaptation.",
      "He highlighted differences between vulnerability and adaptation analyses, and discussed the importance of understanding what information is needed, and the necessary degree of accuracy.",
      "He discussed the pros and cons of top-down and bottom-up approaches and stressed that there is no right or wrong method.",
      "Smith concluded that while methods provide insight, they do not provide all the answers, but can effectively inform the process."
