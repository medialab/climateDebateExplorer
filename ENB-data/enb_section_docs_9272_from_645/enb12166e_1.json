      "In March 2001, the US administration declared its opposition to the Protocol, stating that it believed it to be 'fatally flawed', as it would damage its economy and exempted developing countries from fully participating. Since the US announcement, the EU has sent diplomatic missions to several Parties, including Japan, Australia, Canada, the Russian Federation and Iran, in an effort to maintain support for the Protocol and its entry into force by 2002.",
      "In attempting to persuade the US to alter its position, the UK, some other EU countries and Japan have recently made attempts to demonstrate a willingness to compromise by leaving the door open for a possible amendment of the Protocol.",
      "One suggestion raised in early July by President Pronk and others is a possible two-year delay to the start of the first commitment period.",
      "The US has stated that it will participate at COP-6 Part II in negotiations on the Protocol in cases where talks might lead to outcomes affecting US trade, or if negotiations could set precedents for other international agreements.",
      "The US will be fully involved in all discussions relating to their commitments under the UNFCCC."
