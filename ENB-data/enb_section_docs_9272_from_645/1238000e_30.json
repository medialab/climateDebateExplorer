      "The Chair accepted a Saudi Arabian proposal to replace a reference to the possible design of a MCP with one on reporting to the COP as instructed.",
      "The meeting adopted the draft decision. The meeting then adopted the Chair`s draft text on linkages between AG-13 and AGBM, as amended by the US and SOUTH AFRICA, asking the COP to decide that the AGBM may, in its consideration of a MCP, seek such advice as may be deemed necessary from AG-13. Both of these draft decisions were incorporated into the Report of AG-13 (FCCC/CP/1996/L.1) and adopted by the COP."
