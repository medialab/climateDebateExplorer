      "On the structure, purpose and principles of JI, the G-77/CHINA noted its submission on elements that should be addressed to enable the COP/MOP to elaborate guidelines.",
      "They include, inter alia, participation of Parties in Article 6 (JI) projects, supplementarity, climate change effectiveness, transparency, criteria for project baselines and guidelines for monitoring, verification and reporting.",
      "CHINA suggested focusing on cluster issues, including: principles, purpose, nature and scope; methodological issues; and institutional issues.",
      "The EU suggested including appendices on technical issues such as baselines and monitoring.",
      "SWITZERLAND inquired about a date for early crediting, noting the lack of clarity in the case of JI.",
      "The EU stated that there is no provision for it in the Protocol.",
      "JAPAN noted convergence on environmental and cost effectiveness, equity and transparency.",
      "The US emphasized that JI differed from the CDM, since it does not share the goal of promoting sustainable development. On Parties participating in JI, the EU said they should have ratified the Protocol and be bound by a compliance regime.",
      "On the involvement of legal entities, she noted the impact they may have on a Party`s responsibilities under Protocol Article 3 (QELROs). Regarding project eligibility, the EU identified convergence on a two-step approach in JI, validation before implementation and certification of emissions reductions, and in elements relating to assessment of additionality.",
      "However, she noted diverging views on the methodology for determining baselines.",
      "JAPAN preferred addressing initiation of JI projects along with project eligibility and said many countries did not concur with the two-step approach.",
      "The US underlined the need to ensure environmental additionality of JI projects. Concerning project monitoring, the EU said participants should provide information on their provisions for systematic, accurate and periodic monitoring and submit the necessary monitoring data to show that the project has resulted in quantifiable and long- term reductions. On the definition of emissions reduction units (ERUs), the US noted convergence on how to denominate, serialize and track ERUs, and reiterated the need to recognize that procedures used elsewhere may not be appropriate for constructing JI.",
      "The US also said the registry was an important element to ensure accurate reporting, tracking, and compliance. On the relationship of JI to the AIJ pilot phase, the US, supported by the EU, said AIJ activities might be eligible for JI if they fulfill the rules and requirements set for such projects.",
      "Regarding supplementarity, the EU restated its proposal for a concrete ceiling on the use of all three mechanisms."
