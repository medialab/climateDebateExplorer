      "Tariq Banuri, Senior Research Director, Tellus Institute, discussed climate change models and policies from a broader sustainable development perspective.",
      "He said a lesson from using earlier frameworks/models is that they need to be participatory at both the international and national level, and include an effective and inclusive policy process.",
      "He said it may be necessary to rework current models or develop complementary models.",
      "Noting the global income inequity, he also addressed the issue of economic rents and the need for their more equitable distribution. In the ensuing discussion, AUSTRALIA expressed doubt that a reconstruction effort of current climate change models was necessary.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA noted the vulnerability of developing countries that are heavily dependent on the export of fossil fuels.",
      "He said the FCCC recognizes that no country should bear a disproportionate share of the burden of the impacts of climate change.",
      "In response to a question from BOLIVIA on the CDM, Banuri said it could provide incentives for investment in developing countries, but that much work remained to ensure that it contributed to sustainable development."
