      "While speeches by Kofi Annan and Nicholas Stern had delegates crowding plenary rooms and congregating around television monitors at Gigiri in the morning, the UNFCCC Dialogue afternoon session did not meet all expectations.",
      "More like a monologue, suggested one delegate, who noted too little time for interactive discussions.",
      "However, optimists observed that this was the first time some new proposals were formally presented.",
      "Meanwhile, the question over which entity might host the Adaptation Fund was also being discussed.",
      "While some predict that a decision is unlikely until 2007, insiders report that one prominent candidate to host the Fund has pushed the matter back onto the Nairobi agenda, in the corridors at least, with some forceful lobbying."
