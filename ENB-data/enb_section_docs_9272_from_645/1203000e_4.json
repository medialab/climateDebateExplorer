      "The Climate Action Network has been actively lobbying G-77 countries to endorse the AOSIS draft protocol, which calls for a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 20% by the year 2005.",

      "The fate of the protocol is still uncertain both within the G-77 and in the Committee as a whole.",
      "With so much concern over the adequacy or inadequacy of commitments, as evidenced by the crowds in Working Group I, many are looking forward to the discussion on this matter."
