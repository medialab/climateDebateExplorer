      "On further work on emission scenarios, the Panel agreed to: recognize that the development of scenarios for a fifth assessment report would be undertaken by the scientific community and that the IPCC may catalyze such work; call for the IPCC Chair, assisted by the Working Group Co-Chairs, to prepare a scoping document for a Technical Paper following the release of the AR4; request that the IPCC Chair form a steering committee to organize an IPCC meeting in 2007, to be attended by members of the TGICA and the former TGNES, and the Co-Chairs of the three Working Groups or their representatives; hold a meeting in 2007 to consider: the desirable and feasible characteristics of emission scenarios including consistency, comparability, transparency, and the enhancement of developing country involvement; information exchange on plans for developing scenarios and coordinating activities among the scientific community; enhancing the involvement of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in scenario development; and relevant issues for the assessment of scenarios; and request the IPCC Chair send a letter one year before the meeting in 2007 to groups involved in the development of scenarios inviting them to provide information on plans and activities supporting coordination."
