      "BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, presented basic principles for Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4 (additional activities).",
      "He said that, inter alia: activities should not change the Protocol's global climate change mitigation effect; forest conservation and rehabilitation of degraded lands should be recognized as adaptation activities and receive a share of the mechanisms' proceeds; a transfer of commitments to a future commitment period should not be allowed; carbon removed through LULUCF activities shall be considered temporary; and the simple presence of carbon stocks in national reservoirs shall not result in credits in line with Article 5.2. In response to the presentation, NEW ZEALAND called for consistency with Protocol language, and said the issue of share of proceeds for adaptation should be addressed later, and elsewhere.",
      "The US noted that issues of permanence will be addressed in Annex I countries because of inventory requirements.",
      "BOLIVIA called for an operational link to the CDM. Co-Chair Gwage said the principles outlined by the G-77/China would provide the basis for a preamble for a decision on Article 3.3 and 3.4.",
