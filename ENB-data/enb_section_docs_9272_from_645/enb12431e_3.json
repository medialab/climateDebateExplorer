      "AUSTRALIA, the EU, JAPAN, CHILE and others welcomed the table as useful.",
      "Many parties suggested corrections to have their views properly reflected.",
      "Facilitator Flores said the table should be seen as a reference tool and not a negotiating text, and that the intention was to have a document for discussion, as well as to hold a broader discussion.",
      "She said she would also raise the issue of additional meeting time with the AWG-LCA Chair."
