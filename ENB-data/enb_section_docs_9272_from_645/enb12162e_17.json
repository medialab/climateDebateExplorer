      "With President Pronk's new proposal on the table, and his call for careful reflection before making a judgment still fresh in delegates' minds, many were cautious in their reactions late Thursday/early Friday.",
      "NGO observers expressed concern at text on issues such as additional activities and funding, suggesting that Umbrella Group positions were visible on a number of issues.",
