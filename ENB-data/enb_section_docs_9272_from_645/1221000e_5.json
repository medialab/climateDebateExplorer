      "On Thursday, 30 March 1995, the COW considered the report of the GEF to the COP (FCCC/CP/1995/4).",
      "The Secretariat introduced the document and noted that the report was divided into two sections, the development of an operational strategy and the initial activities undertaken by the GEF, including enabling activities for national communications and projects.",
      "The first section describes a two track approach.",
      "COP-1 may adopt a strategy of maximizing short-term cost effectiveness, long-term cost effectiveness, or a mixed strategy of short- and long-term priorities.",
      "The second section describes the initial activities undertaken by the GEF on climate change.",
      "The Chair noted that COP-1 had to decide between the various approaches described and that he would hold consultations on these matters. On Friday, 31 March 1995, the Chair introduced document FCCC/CP/1995/L.1, a draft decision on the report of the GEF to the COP on the development of an operational strategy and on initial activities in the field of climate change.",
      "The Committee agreed to recommend that the COP adopt this decision, which accepts the GEF Council's two-track approach in 1995.",
      "Under track one, the GEF Secretariat will work to develop a long-term comprehensive operational strategy, and under track two, some project activities will be undertaken to allow a smooth transition between the pilot phase and the restructured GEF.",
      "The decision also includes a 'mixed strategy' wherein projects will be selected on the basis of either long-term or short-term programme priorities."
