   "sentences": [
      "In opening plenary on Monday, 2 November, COP-3 President Hiroshi Ohki (Japan) recalled the important role played by COP-3 in responding to the Berlin Mandate and said COP-4 faces the challenge of maintaining the political momentum created in Kyoto.",
      "He noted the need to review existing economic structures and re-examine lifestyles. Maria Julia Alsogaray, Secretary of Natural Resources and Sustainable Development of Argentina, was elected President of COP-4.",
      "She noted that while Argentina was not one of the countries that has 'historic responsibilities' for the climate change problem, it wished to belong to the group holding future responsibilities for commitment leading to a solution.",
      "She said she wanted COP-4 to signal a new momentum in the process and said an action plan for future work should be established.",
      "She stated that developing countries share some responsibility for climate change and they have an ethical duty to ensure sustainable development. Michael Zammit Cutajar, Executive Secretary of the FCCC, noted that this was the first COP to be held in a developing country.",
      "He anticipated that an action plan with ambitious and politically firm deadlines would be created as a result of this meeting.",
      "He said COP-4 presented an opportunity to revitalize the FCCC, perhaps through strengthening the transfer of technology and know-how and financial support.",
      "COP-4 could mark the occasion where the business community increased its role in combating climate change through efficient programmes conducted in an equitable way. The following delegates were then elected as officers of the COP: Papa Cham (The Gambia); Mohamed Al Sabban (Saudi Arabia); Tengiz Gzirishvili (Georgia); Harald Dovland (Norway); Ole Plougmann (Denmark); Espen R\u00f8nneberg, (Marshall Islands); John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda); Bakary Kante (Senegal); Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia); and Maciej Sadowski (Poland). On organizational matters, the Executive Secretary proposed changes to the provisional agenda (FCCC/CP/1998/1).",
      "SAUDI ARABIA, supported by KUWAIT, proposed addressing Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 (adverse impacts) as a separate item on the agenda.",
      "MAURITANIA noted that no objections were raised to the proposed agenda changes during informal consultations on 1 November.",
      "As a compromise, the Executive Secretary proposed adding Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 in parentheses to the agenda item on FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse impacts).",
      "SAUDI ARABIA, supported by VENEZUELA, accepted the proposal, but stressed that discussion under Item 5 (matters related to the Kyoto Protocol) should allow time for Articles 2.3 and 3.14.",
      "The plenary adjourned to allow the subsidiary bodies to begin their work. On Friday, 6 November, delegates met in a 'stock-taking' plenary.",
      "COP-4 President Alsogaray offered condolences to the Caribbean and Latin American countries devastated by Hurricane Mitch.",
      "She noted that floods, fires, droughts and hurricanes had profoundly affected countries around the world and suggested that 'Mother Nature' was reminding delegates that urgent action was needed.",
      "Delegates observed a moment of silence for the recent tragedies at the request of INDONESIA, on behalf of the G-77/China.",
      "He also proposed that the Secretariat draft a statement of sympathy for the affected countries.",
      "The President also reported that Antigua and Barbuda ratified the Kyoto Protocol on 3 November. Delegates also heard reports from the Chairs of the Subsidiary Bodies.",
      "The Chair of AG13, Patrick Sz\u00e9ll (UK), presented the draft decision on the Multilateral Consultative Process (FCCC/CP/1998/L.3).",
      "He reported that Parties had accepted the thrust of the proposal.",
      "However, delegates did not agree on the size and composition of the Multilateral Consultative Committee.",
      "The President said she would hold intersessional meetings to tackle outstanding issues. Delegates also heard statements from: Hama Arba Diallo, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD); William Kennedy, Senior Officer for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD); Prodipto Ghosh, Senior Environment Specialist from the Asian Development Bank (ADB); and Walter Arensberg, Chief of the Environmental Division of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB); and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat. Voluntary Commitments: During the plenary on Monday, 2 November, delegates discussed voluntary commitments by non-Annex I Parties (Agenda Item 6) when considering the agenda.",
      "ARGENTINA recalled its request to include this item on the agenda and noted that no consensus had emerged despite its efforts to encourage consultations. INDONESIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, said this issue had been deliberated at length, but no consensus had been reached.",
      "He proposed adoption of the agenda without Item 6.",
      "INDIA recalled that the debate at Kyoto rejected the idea of voluntary commitments, stating it was not implied in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, VENEZUELA and ALGERIA cautioned that discussion of the issue at this stage would be divisive and distract from discussions of compliance and continuing increases in developed countries' emissions.",
      "BRAZIL described the FCCC as an exercise in burden sharing, recognizing differentiated responsibilities between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties.",
      "He noted that non-Annex I Parties are well ahead in meeting their existing commitments and, with CHINA, cautioned that this item was not intended to promote the FCCC, but to help some countries avoid existing commitments.",
      "IRAN and UNITED ARAB EMIRATES noted that neither the FCCC nor the Kyoto Protocol provides for voluntary commitments and cautioned that the discussion could lead to the imposition of commitments on developing countries. CHINA noted that developed country emissions were projected to be 5% above 1990 levels by 2000 and 13% above 1990 levels by 2010.",
      "He distinguished developing country 'survival emissions' from developed country 'luxury emissions' and said developing countries risked losing financial assistance and technology transfer under the FCCC.",
      "He said voluntary commitments would create a new category of Parties under the FCCC and could destroy the unity of the G-77/China.",
      "He said the COP Presidency should remain neutral.",
      "QATAR, TOGO, CUBA, THAILAND and UGANDA supported the G-77/China. ZIMBABWE, TANZANIA and SOUTH AFRICA said methodological and institutional issues relating to the flexibility mechanisms, such as the CDM, should be the focus of deliberation.",
      "SAMOA acknowledged that the Convention and its objectives stood to gain from a further discussion of voluntary commitments, but discussion at this stage would be detrimental.",
      "Discussions should focus on what could be expected from developing countries and initiatives Annex I countries could take to assist developing countries.",
      "COLOMBIA suggested that the vulnerability of developing nations, rather than their commitments, be discussed.",
      "CHILE said several developing countries were making serious efforts to limit GHG emissions and favored an exchange of views on voluntary cooperation, without entailing binding obligations or ignoring the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. AUSTRALIA noted that Annex I countries alone cannot fulfill the goals of the FCCC and said it was a sensitive issue that should be discussed in a non-controversial manner.",
      "With JAPAN, she said that non-Annex I Parties wishing to adopt voluntary commitments must be given an opportunity to consider their options under the Kyoto Protocol. The US expressed regret that divisions among Parties would prevent delegates from putting all the issues on the table at this session.",
      "An open and full discussion on options could clarify a number of questions, including: how Parties would join Annex B; how base years would be determined; how Parties would develop targets; and whether Parties would still be able to host CDM projects.",
      "With JAPAN and CANADA, NEW ZEALAND supported a discussion on this item.",
      "He said if this were not done, the President should use her prerogative to facilitate informal consultations.",
      "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION reminded delegates that within 15 years, emissions from non-Annex I countries would exceed those of Annex I countries.",
      "The CZECH REPUBLIC, with HUNGARY and SLOVENIA, supported the inclusion of Item 6 and noted that it could foster useful debate and dialogue.",
      "POLAND said if Parties wanted to adhere to FCCC goals, they should be encouraged to assume voluntary commitments.",
      "This dialogue would reflect the dynamic situation in the global economy and changes within Parties. AUSTRIA, on behalf of the EU, said the question of broadening commitments in the long term is necessary and unavoidable.",
      "He recognized the achievements of many non-Annex I countries.",
      "He said it may not be possible to resolve this issue in plenary and proposed that the COP President take a decision on how to proceed. ARGENTINA said no aspect of the FCCC and the Protocol limited its ability to raise the issue of voluntary commitments.",
      "He said the manner in which delegates address the issue would require discussion.",
      "Delegates adopted the provisional agenda without Item 6, as no consensus existed on its inclusion.",
      "The President noted that as several Parties had expressed interest in continuing discussion, she would facilitate informal consultations.",
      "CHINA cautioned against the proposed informal consultations, stating they could jeopardize the neutrality of the presidency.",
      "INDIA and SAUDI ARABIA observed that the item had been deleted because there was no consensus on further discussion.",
      "Voluntary commitments should not be considered and the President should not participate in consultations."
