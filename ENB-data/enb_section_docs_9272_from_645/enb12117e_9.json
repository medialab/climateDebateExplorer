      "This contact group considered draft conclusions on national systems, adjustments and guidelines under Protocol Articles 5 (methodology), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information).",
      "It also considered a draft annex setting out basic elements of national systems under Protocol Article 5.1 (national systems for GHG emissions and removals) that had been presented by JAPAN and amended after informal consultations by a smaller group of Parties.",
      "Discussion focused on a paragraph relating to adjustments under Protocol Article 5.2 (methodology).",
      "After considerable discussion, the group agreed to wording noting that the SBSTA 'considered' rather than 'agreed' that adjustments referred to in this Article should only be applied when inventory data submitted by Parties are incomplete and/or are calculated in a way that is not consistent with the IPCC 1996 Revised Guidelines as set out by any good practice agreed on by the COP.",
      "The group concluded its work on both documents, which will be submitted to SBSTA for its consideration."
