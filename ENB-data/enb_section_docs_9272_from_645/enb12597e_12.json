      "Participants approved paragraphs on: transport sector emissions, growth projections and overall potential sectoral emissions reductions ; and mitigation measures for transport modes and infrastructure , and related mitigation potential without or with only minor editorial changes.",
      "On a paragraph on potential and constraints of strategies to reduce carbon intensity in transport , relating to a sentence stating: 'Mitigation potential of biofuels will depend on technology advances and on the level of emissions associated with the availability of sustainable feedstock supplies', Norway, supported by Germany, suggested adding 'in the production of' biofuels after 'technology advances'.",
      "Brazil suggested removing the sentence given similar language elsewhere in the SPM.",
      "This was opposed by the CLAs who felt it was important for the 'transport story'.",
      "After consultations between the CLAs, Brazil and Norway, participants agreed to the following sentence: 'Commercially available liquid and gaseous biofuels already provide co-benefits together with mitigation options that can be increased by technology advances'.",
      "On a sentence on reducing black carbon and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, the US, supported by Switzerland, suggested replacing black carbon and NOx with particulate matter and ozone and aerosol precursors.",
      "Switzerland also proposed adding tropospheric ozone.",
      "Mexico called for keeping black carbon.",
      "Norway, supported by Luxembourg and the US and opposed by Saudi Arabia, stressed the importance of keeping NOx, stating that it was better understood by policymakers.",
      "The CLAs proposed, and participants approved, the following reformulation: 'Reducing transport emissions of particulate matter (including black carbon), tropospheric ozone and aerosol precursors (including NOx) can have human health and mitigation co-benefits in the short term'.",
      "Participants agreed to a paragraph on variations in the cost-effectiveness of different carbon reduction measures in the transport sector .",
      "On the influence of regional differences in the choice of transport mitigation options , the Philippines and Saudi Arabia suggested, and participants agreed to, revisions reflecting how recommendations on transport measures apply to countries in different situations.",
      "Participants also approved a paragraph stating that mitigation strategies can help decouple transport GHG emissions from economic growth .",
      "Buildings: On a sentence on final energy use and GHG emissions in buildings , Norway suggested adding text on mitigation potentials.",
      "A CLA said this information was already elsewhere in the text.",
      "Participants approved the sentence as is and agreed to the remainder of the sub-section.",
      "Industry: The majority of this section was approved with minor editorial amendments.",
      "Only a sentence on the reduction of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions by process optimization and refrigerant recovery, recycling and substitution as key mitigation opportunities prompted discussion, with China noting that the section was not comprehensive enough and calling for including mention of barriers to these mitigation opportunities.",
      "Switzerland suggested adding reference to barriers at the end of the sentence, followed by a reference from the underlying report, as suggested by China.",
      "Participants agreed to this insertion."
