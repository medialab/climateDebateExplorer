      "This issue was first taken up in the COP/MOP plenary on Wednesday, 1 December.",
      "Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee (JISC) Chair Beno\u00eet Leguet presented the JISC s annual report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2010/9).",
      "The matter was subsequently considered in a contact group and informal consultations co-chaired by Washington Zhakata (Zimbabwe) and Helmut Hojesky (Austria).",
      "During the contact group s first meeting, Co-Chair Hojesky outlined six issues: the financial situation; continuation of joint implementation (JI) in the post-2012 period; participation by countries in the process of becoming Protocol Annex B parties; JI s future and possible merger of the two JI tracks; review and revision of JI guidelines; and further guidance to the JISC.",
      "Discussions in the contact group were based on a draft COP/MOP decision produced by the co-chairs based on parties views and comments.",
      "On the proposed fee, the EU expressed a willingness to discuss ways to ensure the JISC s financial sustainability and highlighted the need for transparency concerning the JISC s needs.",
      "Ukraine identified the need to consult on the level of the proposed fee and Japan said the proposed fee could discourage JI activities.",
      "Parties discussed: the level of a fee; the possibility of differentiated fee levels for large and small-scale projects; and the point at which the fee would be payable.",
      "Some parties proposed, and other opposed, insertion of text referring to the fee becoming applicable after the adoption of a second Kyoto Protocol commitment period.",
      "Consensus eventually emerged on this matter.",
      "Regarding Annex I parties whose quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives (QELROs) have not yet been inscribed in Protocol Annex B but who wish to host JI projects, parties considered whether credits can be issued from projects in such countries, such as Belarus.",
      "Belarus highlighted that his country is ready to implement a number of JI projects using the Track 2 procedure, indicating that they are only waiting to achieve Annex B status.",
      "On the post-2012 JI, Ukraine identified the need for further explanations concerning the proposal to issue credits during the possible gap period.",
      "Parties discussed a paragraph allowing crediting from JI projects after the first commitment period, using Assigned Amount Units (AAUs) from the first commitment period.",
      "Several parties objected to this paragraph, stating that a conversion of first commitment period AAUs to Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) must be based on emission reductions achieved in the first commitment period.",
      "Regarding a new JI operational model, parties discussed two options, which are to formulate a new single JI track or maintain but strengthen the separate tracks.",
      "The EU stressed that any discussion on the JI operational model must not prejudge the design of the post-2012 climate change framework.",
      "On the paragraphs in the draft decision taking note of the JISC s view on the need for a new JI operational model beyond 2012 and the scenarios for improving JI beyond 2012, some parties objected to these paragraphs, highlighting the need for clarity regarding references to beyond 2012 and the relationship with the Kyoto Protocol.",
      "The COP/MOP adopted its decision on 10 December."
