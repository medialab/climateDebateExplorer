      "It requests JI Supervisory Committee to develop, as a priority, standards and procedures for accrediting independent entities, accredit such entities, and develop a management plan and guidelines for small-scale JI projects. The COP/MOP decides that the CDM`s designated operational entities may be provisionally and conditionally used in determining JI projects, and that the CDM Executive Board`s small-scale methodologies and the CDM project design document may be applied to JI projects, as appropriate."
