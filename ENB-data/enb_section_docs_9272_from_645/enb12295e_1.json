      "Sok Appadu, Mauritius Meteorological Service, opened the session and welcomed delegates.",
      "In thanking Mauritius for hosting the meeting, IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri (India) noted the importance to Mauritius of assessing climate change because of potential sea level rise and the role of agriculture in its economy.",
      "He highlighted the benefits of holding IPCC meetings in different locations, including the opportunity for IPCC members to interact with local scientific and governmental experts. Hong Yan, Deputy Secretary-General, WMO, said the IPCC has become an authoritative voice on the science of climate change and added that several decisions taken at the eleventh Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 11) and the first Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 1) were based on IPCC findings.",
      "He also indicated the readiness of WMO bodies to cooperate with the IPCC. Alexander Alusa, Division for Environmental Conventions, UNEP, underscored UNEP`s intention to support the IPCC in disseminating the results of the AR4 as widely as possible and noted that UNEP`s Information Unit for Conventions is already disseminating the Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage. Halldor Thorgeirsson, Deputy Executive Secretary, UNFCCC, noted important areas for the interplay of science and policy, such as the five-year programme of work on adaptation of the UNFCCC`s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the proposal under the UNFCCC to address emissions from deforestation.",
      "Thorgeirsson drew attention to the reference to the IPCC in the COP`s decision on long-term cooperative action on climate change under the UNFCCC and stressed the IPCC`s role in directly influencing national positions. Anil Bachoo, Minister of Environment and National Development Unit of Mauritius, urged the IPCC to provide regionally relevant information to developing countries and cautioned that the full impacts of climate change on the ecosystems of small island developing states may not be appreciated, due to lack of information and scientific research. Delegates approved the agenda for the meeting (IPCC-XXV/Doc.",
