      "Ecuador drew attention to serious procedural problems, highlighting lack of transparency and inclusiveness.",
      "South Africa recalled the COP Presidency s undertaking to ensure a party-driven process.",
      "Bolivia said the problem was one of substance, not just procedure, highlighting that the Danish texts did not reflect the outcome of a democratic or participatory process.

      "He reminded parties that the COP plenary would convene in the afternoon and parties could then decide how to proceed."
