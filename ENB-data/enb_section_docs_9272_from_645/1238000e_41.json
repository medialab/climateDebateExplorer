      "There were heated discussions as Parties exchanged views on the adoption of the Ministerial Declaration, or 'Geneva Declaration' as it was christened during the Closing Plenary.",
      "The Declaration endorses the IPCC`s conclusions, including the finding that the continued rise in GHG concentrations will interfere with the climate system, and calls for legally binding objectives and significant reductions in emissions.",
      "However, environmental NGOs quickly noted that the Declaration does not specify that reductions should be well below the 1990 level set in the FCCC, fails to call for binding coordinated measures, and does not specify an upper-bound concentration level of GHGs.",
      "Sixteen delegations, including many oil producers, objected to both the Declaration`s content and handling, as well as the transparency of the process that produced it."
