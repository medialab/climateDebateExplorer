      "The most significant issue taken up during the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali was the question of a multilateral framework to address climate change during the post-2012 period, when the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period expires.",
      "Negotiators spent much of their time seeking to agree on a two-year process - or Bali roadmap - to finalize a post-2012 regime by December 2009.",
      "Negotiations were conducted in a number of groups under the aegis of both the Convention and the Protocol.",
      "Under the Convention, the discussions focused on how to follow up on the Dialogue on long-term cooperative action to address climate change by enhancing implementation of the Convention.",
      "Under the Protocol, the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Protocol Annex I Parties (AWG) discussed its work programme and timetable for completing its work.",
      "Protocol parties also considered preparations for the second review of the Protocol under Article 9 at COP/MOP 4.",
      "Delegates also held consultations on the Russian proposal on voluntary commitments.",
      "During the negotiations, several issues proved difficult to resolve, especially during the talks on long-term cooperative action under the Convention.",
      "Text on mitigation by developed and developing countries was particularly contentious, with ministers and other senior officials continuing to meet well beyond the scheduled close of the meeting at 6:00 pm on Friday, 14 December.",
      "After meeting in a small-group setting until shortly after 2:00 am on Saturday morning and reaching a tentative agreement, the plenary reconvened at 8:30 am.",
      "However, some parties were still unable to agree on text on developing countries ` mitigation actions, and it appeared that discussions were on the verge of a breakdown.",
      "At 10:30 am, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono returned to the conference, urging delegates to reach a compromise.",
      "Agreement remained elusive until Saturday afternoon, when parties finally agreed to a proposal by India and other developing countries to text referring to nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country parties in the context of sustainable development, supported by technology and enabled by finance and capacity building in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner.",
      "After the EU and all other parties had accepted this language, the US agreed to join the consensus, and the decision on long-term action under the Convention was adopted.",
      "The AWG and COP/MOP then adopted decisions on the other elements of the Bali roadmap, with the meeting finally ending 24 hours past its scheduled finish.",
      "These decisions establish a process and set out guidance and direction for a series of meetings over the next two years under both the Convention and Protocol, with the aim of producing a comprehensive outcome on post-2012 issues at COP 15 and COP/MOP 5 in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009."
