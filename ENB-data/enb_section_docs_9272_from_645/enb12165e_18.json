      "Leo Meyer, Co-Chair of the Financial Task Team, introduced the agenda item on the budget on Friday, 6 April.",
      "He noted that the current budgetary situation was stable, and that one country had committed to substantially increased contributions.",
      "He mentioned that the WMO had submitted an analysis on IPCC financial matters, and suggested measures that should be taken to improve financial reporting and transparency.",
      "He called attention to high shipping and mailing costs.",
      "He noted that the budget proposal for 2002 was still in draft form, and that there were no certain figures for the post- TAR period, since the work programme remains to be agreed upon.",
      "In the ensuing discussion, the need to ensure that the IPCC stays on a sound financial basis was brought up, and the need to broaden the budgetary base was underscored, as the funding situation is likely to change in the future.",
      "Some participants expressed concern over the uncertainty with regard to funding."
