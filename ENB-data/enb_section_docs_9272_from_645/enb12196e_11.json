      "Co-Chair Rawleston Moore introduced updated draft conclusions, which he said attempted to incorporate the various views expressed by Parties during previous contact group meetings.",
      "A number of Parties, including the G-77/CHINA, EU, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, US and JAPAN, said the text was a good basis for their work, and stressed the need for a balanced approach. Parties then considered the draft conclusions paragraph-by- paragraph.",
      "On text requesting the Secretariat to prepare a document on using the TAR to facilitate consideration of routine agenda items in the future, the G-77/CHINA proposed an amendment to request submissions from Parties instead.",
      "With the SEYCHELLES, he suggested that an additional six months would allow for a more careful consideration of the TAR by developing countries.",
      "JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND and other Annex I Parties questioned the necessity of a further round of submissions, and preferred text supporting action by the Secretariat in time for SB-17. Following extensive comments by Parties on several of the remaining paragraphs, Co-Chair Moore said a revised text taking Parties` views into account would be presented on Tuesday."
