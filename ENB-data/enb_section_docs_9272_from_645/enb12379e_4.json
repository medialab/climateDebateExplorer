      "The contact group, co-chaired by Figueres and Lacasta, met twice on Friday.",
      "Co-Chair Figueres explained that the focus of the group s work would be Annex II of document ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/3 ), containing parties views on means available to Annex I Parties to meet their emission reduction targets.",
      "She proposed that the group focus on those items in Annex II, which could have a significant impact on Annex I Parties reduction targets.",
      "Co-Chair Figueres suggested categorizing the items as either big ticket or non-big ticket, and beginning consideration of the big ticket items.",
      "AUSTRALIA, NORWAY, the EU, CANADA and others supported this approach.",
      "South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, opposed this strategy, stating that some of the items enumerated in Annex II are beyond the group s mandate, as they would require amendments to the Kyoto Protocol.",
      "He proposed dividing the issues into: items being considered elsewhere, such as under SBSTA; items which would require amendments to the Kyoto Protocol; and rule-based items, which he said are within the group s mandate.",
      "Co-Chair Figueres proposed using both approaches, which the group accepted.",
      "Parties carried out the classification, and the Co-Chairs undertook to prepare a document reflecting these categorizations."
