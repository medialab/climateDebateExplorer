      "During informal consultations, parties were invited to identify the key elements to include in a consolidated text from the facilitator s note, the work undertaken in Copenhagen (FCCC/CP/2010/2), the Tianjin negotiating text (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/14), and the AWG-LCA Chair s text (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/CRP.1).",
      "Many parties opposed this approach, noting that the Tianjin text already reflects varied parties views, highlighted the lack of time to provide a concrete outcome in Cancun and the danger of engaging in an exercise of cherry picking paragraphs, especially for specific sector issues such as agriculture.",
      "On key elements, many parties identified: a general framework; agriculture; and international aviation and maritime transport.",
      "Many parties also opposed proposals to include hydrofluorocarbons as a key element, saying this issue is not within the mandate of the group and does not constitute a specific sector previously addressed.",
      "Many countries highlighted that discussions should focus on a general framework to enhance the implementation of Convention Article 4.1(c) (technology transfer), bunker fuels and agriculture in depth and then move forward to address specific sectors.",
      "Some parties made proposals on text that should be included in the general framework.",
      "One party questioned whether the general framework should be addressed by the shared vision group."
