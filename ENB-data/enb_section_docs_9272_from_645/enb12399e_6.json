      "South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, proposed classifying impacts in a way that leads to action, i.e.",

SAUDI ARABIA highlighted impacts on international trade and suggested, inter alia , elimination of green protectionism in Annex I countries, removal of subsidies, a comprehensive approach without targeting specific sectors, and support for economic diversification.

KUWAIT drew attention to the negative effects of uncertainty regarding oil demand and called for support mechanisms and technological options such as carbon capture and storage. QATAR highlighted the deficit of methodologies for assessing negative consequences and called for policy selection criteria based on environmental protection goals and the prevention or minimization of negative impacts.",
