      "SBI Chair Ashe opened the joint meeting and invited Jukka Uosukainen, with whom he had co-chaired a contact group on capacity building in countries with economies in transition (EITs) and in developing countries, to report on the work of the group. On capacity building in EITs, Co-Chair Uosukainen said the group had agreed on a framework that sets out the scope and basis for action in EITs, identifies EIT priorities, and outlines responsibilities of EITs in implementing the framework and those of Annex II Parties in assisting EITs. He said the group agreed that the framework should guide capacity- building activities related to UNFCCC implementation.",
      "He noted the cross-cutting nature of the outstanding issues relating to financial issues, which had been conveyed to the group working on the financial mechanism, and to the implementation of adaptation measures and national programmes of action, currently being considered under Article 4.8 and 4.9.",
      "In response to a question by G-77/CHINA on how the financial issues will be resolved, Co-Chair Ashe said these would be discussed by the ministers next week.",
      "Delegates agreed to forward the SBSTA/SBI draft conclusions on capacity building in EITs (FCCC/SB/2000/CRP.17) and in developing countries FCCC/SB/2000/CRP.16) to the COP for its consideration."
