      "As negotiations resumed on Monday, informal consultations in the Friends of the Chair group continued on the SBI agenda without reaching a successful outcome.",
      "Emerging from the room, one delegate said enough is enough, proclaiming that the only way forward now would be to resume discussions in a plenary setting.",
      "While delegates continue attempts to thrash out how to continue work under the SBI and ADP, international media attention, notably absent from Bonn, focused on the new International Energy Agency report, indicating that GHG emissions from fossil fuel use rose to record levels in 2012 and warning that the world is heading for between 3.6 \u00b0C and 5.3 \u00b0C warming - way above the agreed UNFCCC target of keeping the global average temperature rise below 2 \u00b0C from pre-industrial times.",
      "The report also urges countries and companies to, among other things: implement aggressive energy-efficiency measures; reduce the release of methane in oil and gas operations; and phase out fossil-fuel subsidies.",
      "On a lighter note, a GRULAC lunchtime meeting was successful in agreeing that Peru will host COP 20 and the pre-COP will be held in Venezuela.",
      "This led a few delegates to joke about the post-meeting rush to Machu Picchu to wind down after what may well turn out to be a hectic 2014 meeting."
