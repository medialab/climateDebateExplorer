      "During the first week of negotiations, delegates met several times in contact group meetings and 'informal informal' consultations co-chaired by SBI Chair John Ashe and Kerry Groves (Australia) to consider draft text on additional guidance to the GEF.",
      "Discussions cleared some bracketed text, however disagreements remained on several paragraphs, including sources of information on which to base funding for Stage II adaptation activities.",
      "Draft conclusions were forwarded by the SBI to the COP-6 on Monday, 20 November.",
      "Also during the first week, a group on financial issues - mandated by President Pronk - met on 17 and 18 November to begin discussions on cross-cutting financial and funding issues being considered in parallel negotiations on capacity building, technology transfer and adverse effects.",
      "Due to process-related objections raised by the G-77/China, the financial issues group failed to make substantive progress.",
      "During the second week of negotiations, the financial mechanism and broader issues related to funding were addressed in high-level informal discussions as part of President Pronk's 'Box A' cluster of 'crunch' issues.",
      "Since there was no final agreement in these negotiations, the discussions and draft conclusions were referred to the resumed session of COP-6 for further consideration."
