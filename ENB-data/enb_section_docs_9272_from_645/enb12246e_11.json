      "Chair Pachauri outlined the proposal for an AR4 SYR (IPCC- XXII/Doc.5), describing the need for such a report, highlighting the suggestion that its length be limited to about 30 pages, and explaining that the proposed writing team would consist of four to six writers from each WG and be selected by the IPCC Chair in consultation with the WG Co-Chairs.",
      "IPCC Secretary Christ introduced two possible timelines, noting that both options take into account IPCC-XIX/Decision 6, whereby the SYR must be finalized in the last quarter of 2007. Martin Manning (US), WG I Technical Support Unit (TSU), expressed concern regarding the proposed timeline for the presentation of an advance copy of AR4 SYR at UNFCCC COP-13 in November 2007.",
      "Supported by several others, he urged postponing a decision on timing.",
      "AUSTRIA suggested that the SYR writing team should be consulted to determine timing. With AUSTRIA, MOROCCO, SUDAN, the UK, AUSTRALIA and others, NEW ZEALAND supported the production of AR4 SYR.",
      "He stressed the need for agreement on management, scope and timing of the SYR.",
      "Recalling discussions at IPCC-19, the US asked whether the SYR would address topics or questions.",
      "He pointed to potential problems related to drafting the SYR prior to approval of the WG reports.",
      "In response, Chair Pachauri noted that IPCC-19 had indicated general consensus on having topics rather than questions, but noted that this issue may not be substantive. FRANCE suggested that AR4 SYR should review whether questions from TAR SYR have been answered.",
      "SWITZERLAND said AR4 SYR should present findings since TAR. Numerous speakers stressed that the SYR should not be finalized in time for COP-13 at the expense of its quality.",
      "WG III Co-Chair Davidson stressed that quality is a given parameter, and, with the UK and BRAZIL, emphasized the importance of completing the report by COP-13 for its findings to reach policymakers.",
      "Noting the IPCC`s 'main customer' is the UNFCCC, GERMANY said the SYR must be finalized before COP-13.",
      "The UK said no SYR by COP-13 would represent a 'retrograde step' and make the IPCC 'irrelevant' in the views of some.",
      "BRAZIL noted that it should not be presumed that timing will affect quality. ITALY said the SYR should add value to the work of the WGs, provide an integrated vision and focus on cross-cutting elements.",
      "NORWAY supported employing a communications expert for producing text that is easily accessible to a broader audience.",
      "Discussions on AR4 SYR will continue in Plenary on Wednesday."
