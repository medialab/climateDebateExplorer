      "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2015/L.7), the SBI, inter alia: - welcomes the collaboration between the CTCN and the regional technology transfer and finance centres supported by the GEF under the Poznan strategic programme, and invites the GEF to provide more details in its future reports on its ongoing collaboration with the CTCN; - invites the GEF to provide financial support to non-Annex I parties to conduct their technology needs assessments (TNAs), and to support the implementation of the TNAs\u00a7 results; - encourages those providing inputs to the Poznan strategic programme\u00a7s evaluation to consider how it may support technologies for adaptation and take into account gender responsiveness; and - encourages the TEC, in evaluating the programme, to continue to consult parties, the GCF, GEF implementing agencies and other relevant entities on how to enhance the effectiveness of the Technology Mechanism."
