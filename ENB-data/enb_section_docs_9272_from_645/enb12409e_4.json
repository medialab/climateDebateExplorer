   "sentences": [
      "Lydia Elewa reported that the group had discussed the definition of resilience, indicators of economic resilience, gaps and barriers, methods and tools that may enhance resilience, including through economic diversification, and recommendations.",
      "She said indicators related to markets (competitiveness, available capital), finance (access to credit and saving mechanisms), access to information (translation into local languages, relevance to communities), and gender (equitable access to resources).",
      "She also highlighted indicators related to governance (transparency, flexible and adaptive management institutions), health (healthy labor force), education (financial literacy, flexible learning systems), and infrastructure (transport and communication systems).",
      "Elewa also reported on gaps and barriers to economic resilience, including lack of: education and knowledge; access to adaptation technologies; access to information, finance, insurance and credit; infrastructure, such as telecommunications and transport systems; communication and cooperation among stakeholders; protection of indigenous peoples rights; and effective social safety nets and social protection.",
      "The group recommended: enhancing microinsurance opportunities at the community level through, inter alia : increasing availability of reinsurance; developing incentives for local/national insurers to enter markets; and identifying measures to link microinsurance with existing social protection measures; mainstreaming indigenous and local knowledge into planning, policy and coping strategies through, inter alia , facilitating documentation of knowledge, and developing mechanisms for interfacing indigenous and scientific knowledge; developing mechanisms to assess co-benefits of economic diversification options at the community level, creating tools for assessing investment, and promoting tools that facilitate discussion of stakeholder interests; enhancing women s access to resources for economic resilience, and ensuring their participation in decision making and gender budgeting; identifying incentives for the private sector to develop markets to facilitate access to technologies, such as renewable energies, and developing cost-effective distribution channels; and facilitating sharing and dissemination of best practices on economic resilience options and tools, through establishing a case study library of successes, failures and lessons learned.",
      "During the ensuing discussions, Bangladesh lamented a lack of reference to mobilization of an international resource pool for microinsurance for the poor.",
      "Participants diverged on the extent to which the international community should play a role in delivering finance and technology at the community level.",
      "Oxfam called attention to the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative, as well as proposals under the UNFCCC from the Alliance of Small Island States on financing risk reduction, including compensation for noninsurable risks.",
      "CARICOM highlighted the role of youth at the community level, as well as waste management, particularly in coastal areas."
