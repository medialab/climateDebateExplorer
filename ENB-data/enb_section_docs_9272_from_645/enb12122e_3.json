      "Participants were expressing a sense of pleasant surprise at the prospect of an early finish to COP-5.",
      "Many observers felt that the frank exchange of views in the high-level segment had acted as a catalyst by providing the political impetus needed to complete negotiations and ignite intensified efforts in the lead-up to COP- 6.",
      "However, while many felt satisfied with technical progress made in Bonn, others were concerned that discussions on substantive and complex issues lagged behind and would require intensified intersessional work if COP-6 was to be a success and the Protocol was to come into force in time for Rio+10 in 2002."
