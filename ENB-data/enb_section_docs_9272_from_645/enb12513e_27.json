      "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/ 2011/L.8), the SBSTA acknowledges that alternative common metrics and shortcomings in the use of global warming potentials (GWPs) are still being assessed by the IPCC, and that although GWPs are a well-defined and useful metric, they were not designed with a particular policy goal in mind and that, depending on the specific policy goals, alternative metrics may be preferable.",
      "It also acknowledges the limitations in the use of GWPs in certain situations.",
      "The SBSTA further requests the Secretariat to organize, subject to the availability of resources, a workshop on common metrics and agrees to continue its consideration of this issue at SBSTA 36."
