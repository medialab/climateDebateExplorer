      "A shared vision on long-term cooperative action was first considered by the AWG-LCA contact group on 3 June, based on questions by the AWG-LCA Chair ( http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/ad_hoc_working_groups/lca/application/pdf/indicative_questions_for_cg_shared_vision.pdf ).",
      "AWG-LCA Vice-Chair Reifsnyder facilitated informal consultations on review/assessment of a shared vision.",
      "Key issues discussed included: scope of the preamble; whether a shared vision should be articulated for each of the building blocks and, if so, how; how a long-term global goal for emission reductions should be expressed; and how overall progress in implementation, including the long-term global goal for emission reductions, should be reviewed.",
