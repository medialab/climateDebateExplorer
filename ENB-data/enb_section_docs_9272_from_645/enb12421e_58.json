      "During the contact group and informal discussions, debate revolved around the scope of the SCCF assessment.",
      "The EU supported a broad assessment that includes all the funding windows.",
      "The G-77/China opposed, arguing that this would go beyond the scope mandated in decision 1/CP.12 (further guidance for the operation of the SCCF), saying it only mandates assessment of response measures and economic diversification.",
      "There was also discussion about whether to include the SCCF assessment in the fourth review of the financial mechanism, with some preferring it be done at SB 32 to ensure more information would be available.",
      "Informal consultations continued throughout the day and into the evening before the SBI closing plenary.",
      "In the end, delegates agreed that the assessment of the SCCF will proceed as mandated.",
      "To take into account concerns of those requesting a broader review, parties agreed to insert a paragraph in the conclusions on the review of the financial mechanism ( FCCC/SBI/2009/L.15/Rev.1 ) stating that parties would be invited to submit their views on the operation of funds under the climate change focal area of the GEF and other funds under the Convention, including the SCCF and the LDC Fund."
