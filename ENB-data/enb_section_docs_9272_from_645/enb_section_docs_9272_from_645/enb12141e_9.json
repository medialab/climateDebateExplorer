      "Following these presentations and question-and- answer sessions, delegates discussed key issues relating to Article 3.4.",
      "On activities under Article 3.4, Poland said a wide range of activities should be promoted through the framework of sustainable forest management.",
      "Finland emphasized the role of biofuels and called for national circumstances to be considered when deciding on additional activities.",
      "Emphasizing the importance of carbon in agricultural soils, Canada supported the inclusion of cropland and grassland management and agro-forestry.",
      "Uganda stressed that credits should not be awarded for business- as-usual. Germany, supported by the Netherlands, said activities should not be included under Article 3.4 during the first commitment period unless concerns related to the scale of the use of sinks, scientific uncertainty and risks related to permanence were addressed.",
      "He suggested a pilot project period for activities under Article 3.4 to gain a better understanding of them.",
      "AOSIS recommended Article 3.3 as the key pilot phase in the first commitment period. On accounting approaches, Norway supported full carbon accounting that includes soil carbon and non-CO2 greenhouse gases in the long term.",
      "The Netherlands agreed, but called for careful consideration of short-term implications.",
      "Canada and Japan supported a broad land-based approach.",
      "Australia said its aim was to continue working on a framework approach to accounting, across Article 3.3 and 3.4. On wood products, Canada and France drew attention to opportunities relating to construction products.",
      "Finland noted the environmental soundness of wood products, while observing that discussion on their inclusion is scheduled for 2001. The US National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners supported FAO-based definitions and an accounting framework that reflects land-based human activities. IPCC Chair Bob Watson summarized key issues emerging from the discussions, which he said included: recognition of the difficulty of including aggradation/degradation and the harvest-regeneration cycle under Article 3.3 and implications for the links between Article 3.3 and 3.4; the possibility of using a single threshold that could vary between countries and biomes; the potential role of wood products under either Article 3.3 or 3.4; recognition that the magnitude of a windfall would be very high compared with sequestration achieved through management practices under Article 3.4; and an interest in associating sustainable forest management with carbon enhancement."
