      "Things are starting to get interesting, was how one delegate described the negotiations at the Moon Palace on Wednesday, following the afternoon COP and COP/MOP plenaries.",
      "During the plenaries, dedicated to the proposed new protocols under the Convention and various proposals to amend the Kyoto Protocol, delegates intense interest was hardly surprising given that uncertainty over the legal form of the AWG-LCA s outcome has cast its shadow over the negotiations since COP 13 in Bali, and that the Kyoto Protocol s future seems to be hanging in balance.",
      "Many of those having witnessed the COP s acrimonious discussions on the proposed new protocols in Copenhagen last year were positively surprised by the session.",
      "Parties agreed to the AOSIS proposal to establish a contact group on the legal outcome without any debate or dissent.",
      "Some also observed that positions of key G-77/China countries had shifted towards openly supporting a legally-binding outcome under the AWG-LCA.",
      "This is definitely a positive step towards the right direction - but we may still have different views on what a legally binding outcome means, analyzed one seasoned negotiator after the session.",
      "I m surprised - positively!",
      "What just happened?",
      "exclaimed one observer.",
      "At the same time, some delegates, still traumatized by Copenhagen, expressed concerns over transparency and speculated that many discussions were taking place behind closed doors.",
      "Those in the know confirmed that the green room discussions, convened by the Mexicans, were becoming a regular thing with mitigation being one of the key issues discussed.",
      "Some of the parties concerns crystallized during the evening s AWG-LCA meeting on mitigation with one delegate expressing alarm that this process will be undermined if core issues related to mitigation are the subject of consultations in which all parties can t participate.",
      "Others, however, were encouraged by the consultation process: Someone has to focus on the broad mitigation issues that are common to both tracks and the COP Presidency has reaffirmed that these complementary consultations will support the work of the AWGs.",
      "Rumors were also circulating concerning texts that were being prepared or supposedly scheduled for release: Someone said the COP Presidency might present some concrete ideas in the coming days, it will be interesting to see what form they take, said one seasoned delegate."
