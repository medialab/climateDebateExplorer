      "After what many had qualified as a 'slow start', the second day of ADP 2-6 opened with a call to switch gears.",
      "As discussions on adaptation began, however, a stream of lengthy statements unfolded, and even the Co-Chairs' initiative to allow mixed seating did little to speed up the pace.",
      "While delegates recognized that a constructive dialogue did take place, some lamented that a lot of time was lost in 'repeating the obvious', with accumulating delays in addressing items on the ADP's busy agenda.",
      "With negotiations sliding back to familiar patterns, many remarked that it was clear that more negotiating time would be needed to meet the April 2015 deadline announced by the Co-Chairs.",
      "The contact group on ADP item 3 took the lion's share of delegates' attention, with the full-day TEM on CCUS attracting limited participation.",
      "Some delegates lamented that, while the TEM format is useful for awareness raising, it allows little time for in-depth discussions.",
      "Many noted however, that this was a golden opportunity to make an entry point for CCS in the 2015 agreement."
