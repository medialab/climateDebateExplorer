      "The conclusions on cooperation with UN bodies note a project proposal prepared by the Secretariat in conjunction with UNEP, UNCTAD, UNIDO and UNDP, request the Secretariat to take account of all relevant COP decisions in relation to the project, and invite the WHO to report to SBSTA-12 on its activities related to the risk to human health from climate change, in order to identify how cooperation could be strengthened. In its conclusions on cooperation with other relevant international organizations, SBSTA requests the Secretariat to explore possible ways of strengthening cooperation with other conventions on issues of common interest."
