      "There was a palpable sense of renewed optimism at COP-5's close, encouraged by a determination to inject a quicker pace into the process of fulfilling the BAPA mandate at COP-6.",
      "As the tortoise once taught the fabled hare, however, speed is not the only requirement for success.",
      "For each question clarified at COP-5, others were deferred or not raised at all.",
      "For each attempt to keep interest groups, such as OPEC, on board, there will be new fissures for laggards to exploit in pursuit of delay and obfuscation.",
      "For every powerful signal of political intent, there will be outbursts of systemic inertia in political capitals, no more so than when Washington becomes a well-lit stage for the numbing spectacle of a Presidential election.",
      "From the humble tortoise we might learn that success must also be guided by pace, concentration, and perseverance, backed up by a steady nerve and rock solid defenses to help endure the inevitable arrival of extreme events along the way."
