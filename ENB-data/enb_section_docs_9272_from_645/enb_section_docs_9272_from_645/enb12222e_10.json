      "He outlined solutions and opportunities in which adaptation and mitigation can contribute to sustainable development.",
      "MALAYSIA, for the G-77/China, expressed hope that the new agenda items will not introduce new commitments for developing country Parties, and emphasized that SBSTA should not focus on long-term planning of adaptation and mitigation issues given the urgency of adaptation needs. The EU said SBSTA should use a wide range of approaches and methodologies, including case-studies, technical papers, and workshops, and draw on activities being developed by stakeholders.",
      "JAPAN said the process should be based on a stepwise practical approach.",
      "NORWAY noted the level of convergence and optimism in the pre-sessional consultations and, with NEW ZEALAND, stressed the importance of keeping a balance between bottom-up and top-down approaches. SAUDI ARABIA stressed that SBSTA not go beyond its mandate, and stay within the context of UNFCCC Article 4 (commitments).",
