      "On Tuesday evening, Acting IPCC Secretary Stewart summarized the document on this item (IPCC-XLII/Doc.4), saying that 16 error claims related to AR5 had been reported through the IPCC Error Protocol since IPCC-41.",
      "He noted that the document provides links to lists of errata for each WG report and the SYR that can be accessed online.",
      "He also said it provides additional processes and procedures for addressing errata corrected before publication, for reflecting post-publication errata in electronic publications, and for addressing errata related to translations.",
      "Germany called for amending the proposal for addressing translation errors to give final decisions on such errors to experts rather than to translators.",
      "The Panel agreed to this suggestion."
