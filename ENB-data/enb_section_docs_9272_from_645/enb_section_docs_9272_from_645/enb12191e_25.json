      "Rapporteur Nabil Mina (Lebanon) reported that the group had identified various barriers and constraints, including: limited resources for countries to undertake comprehensive work; lack of data, information, and tools for analysis; and inadequate in-country capacity.",
      "Possible means to overcome these barriers identified by participants included more research and development, increased public awareness, and the establishment of institutions to utilize resources more efficiently.",
      "On capacity building, he said participants had highlighted the need to develop endogenous capacities, the importance of capacity building for adaptation, and the value of permanent cooperative research programmes.",
      "On follow-up activities, his working group had suggested: broader dissemination of information on technical needs assessment and training on their use; the establishment of a fund for coordination and training; and the efficient use of the funds that are already available."
