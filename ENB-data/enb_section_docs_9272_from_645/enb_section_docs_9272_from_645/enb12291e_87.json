      "In this decision on dialogue on long-term cooperative action to address climate change by enhancing implementation of the Convention (FCCC/CP/2005/L.4/Rev.1) the COP reaffirms that development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of developing country parties, and recognizes that there is a diversity of approaches to address climate change and the essential role of technology in addressing climate change.",
      "The COP, inter alia: resolves to engage in a dialogue to exchange experiences and analyze strategic approaches for long-term cooperative action to address climate change including advancing development goals sustainably, adaptation, technology and market-based opportunities; further resolves that the dialogue will be non-binding and will not open any negotiations leading to new commitments; agrees that the dialogue will be informed by the IPCC; agrees that the dialogue should identify actions to promote sustainable development, mitigate and adapt to climate change, and explore ways to promote access by developing countries to climate- friendly technologies; and decides that the dialogue will take place in workshops and will report to COP 12 and COP 13."
