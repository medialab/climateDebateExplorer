      "Vute Wangwacharakul (Thailand) presented an overview of the reported greenhouse gas abatement options.",
      "He noted that all Parties had reported some information about abatement, but that the comprehensiveness of this information and the methodologies applied varied.",
      "He outlined some gaps in the reporting relating to methodological and data issues, including: problems with generation of scenarios; estimation of future emissions; evaluation of abatement options and measures; availability of data and accessibility to models; and the limited exchange of information and experiences.",
      "He highlighted that good efforts had been made despite the fact that there was no requirement to report this information, and said capacity, resources, databases and information were lacking.",
      "He indicated that possible improvements in methodological issues include the use of socioeconomic scenarios, economic tools for cost-benefit analysis, and information networking and exchange on a regional basis.",
      "In conclusion, he stressed the need for human resource and institutional development, financial assistance and access to technologies."
