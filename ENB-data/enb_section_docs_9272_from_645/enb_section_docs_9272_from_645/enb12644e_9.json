      "The group on section H (Capacity Building), which was co-facilitated by Artur Runge-Metzger (EU) and Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu (Democratic Republic of the Congo), met Tuesday through Friday.",
      "On Tuesday morning, parties exchanged views on the placement of text in the Tool and missing elements.",
      "Many parties emphasized the importance of enhancing capacity building, including in the pre-2020 period, which could be done through COP decisions.",
      "Many developing countries called for the agreement to establish a new capacity-building mechanism, stressing the need for coordination and coherence of capacity-building efforts.",
      "Many developed countries opposed creating a new mechanism, with the US suggesting the Durban Forum on Capacity-building could be enhanced instead.",
      "Co-Facilitator Runge-Metzger requested that Swaziland facilitate a spin-off group on Tuesday afternoon on the elements for COP decisions on a pre-2020 functional capacity-building work programme.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Swaziland reported from the pre-2020 spin-off.",
      "Parties noted convergence on the need for enhanced capacity building and started to engage on the question of \"how.\" Parties agreed the pre-2020 spin-off would convene again on Thursday morning, and would be led by Saudi Arabia.",
      "The EU proposed strengthening institutional arrangements through COP decisions based on the outcomes of the third comprehensive review of the capacity-building framework.",
      "China, for the G-77/China, asked for assurance that the proposal for a new capacity-building mechanism would be moved from part 3 to part 1 of the Tool in order to start negotiations with a balanced text.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, a spin-off led by Japan addressed enhancement of institutional capacity-building arrangements.",
      "On Thursday afternoon, both spin-off groups reported that they had not reached the \"bridging\" stage.",
      "Some countries called for a specific discussion on which existing institutions could be strengthened and how, with many developing countries questioning whether the Durban Forum on Capacity-building could address existing gaps.",
      "Parties agreed the Co-Facilitators would capture the discussion in text and gather parties\u00a7 reactions on Friday.",
      "On Friday afternoon, Co-Facilitator Runge-Metzger presented the Co-Facilitators\u00a7 working paper, which he stressed had no status.",
      "He explained that the paper attempts to capture the focus of the negotiations on two options: enhancing and intensifying the capacity-building work of the institutional arrangements established under the Convention; and/or establishing an international capacity-building mechanism.",
      "The working paper also offers the Co-Facilitators\u00a7 reflection of discussions around a pre-2020 capacity-building work programme in the form of a textual proposal.",
      "The proposed text, inter alia: invites parties to assess their capacity-building needs for the implementation of all elements of the agreement, taking into account a long-term perspective; decides that the work programme will address current and emerging gaps and needs, as well as enhancement of coordination and coherence in the provision of capacity building, including within existing institutional arrangements; and creates a means of considering additional activities and modalities of the work programme, taking into account the outcome of the third comprehensive review and the summary reports of the Durban Forum on Capacity-building.",
      "Mexico stressed that regardless of whether the institution is new or old, its ability to meet the capacity-building needs of developing countries will be defined by its work programme.",
      "Several parties suggested insertions or deletions, with the G-77/China adding that the work programme should end in 2020, when a new institution would take its place.",
      "Co-Facilitator Runge-Metzger said the working paper would be updated to reflect these initial reactions, stressing that the Co-Chairs would be informed that parties did not have time to fully discuss it."
