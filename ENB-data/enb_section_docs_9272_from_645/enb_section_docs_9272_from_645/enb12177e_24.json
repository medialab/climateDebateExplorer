      "This decision concerns the timing of the Fourth Assessment Report.",
      "Some delegates called for the Fourth Assessment Report to be completed by 2006, emphasizing the needs of policy- makers for updated information and noting that negotiations on second period commitments under the UNFCCC are due to start by 2005.",
      "Others proposed a later date, noting that scientists must not be overloaded, and that new scientific findings must be available before a new assessment is prepared.",
      "Several participants proposed to defer a decision, stating that the IPCC needs to first consider its overall work programme and consult the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) on its requirements.",
      "Delegates decided to invite the current IPCC Bureau to consult with the expert community and the SBSTA as an input for further consideration of this issue at IPCC- 19."
