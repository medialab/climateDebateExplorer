      "Parties adopted the report for the first two parts of ADP 2 (FCCC/ADP/2013/L.1).",
      "Co-Chair Mauskar indicated that the Co-Chairs had aimed to lay a solid foundation for the 2015 agreement and addressing pre-2020 ambition, stating that, in his view, such a foundation had been established.",
      "He concluded that a ten-thousand-mile journey starts with one step and we have taken several, but the real difficulties start now.",
      "Co-Chair Mauskar expressed confidence that with the new ADP Co-Chairs and with parties continuing constructive spirit, the outcome will be successful.",
      "Co-Chair Dovland recalled that when starting their work, the Co-Chairs came up with the idea of proceeding through roundtables and workshops, and indicated that while this approach has served the ADP well, time has come to move some activities to a more formal setting and noted that there is some repetition in the workshops and roundtables.",
      "Thanking the Secretariat and the parties, Dovland noted that he is retiring from the process for the third time, saying he always misses the people involved, but is getting tired of some of the finger-pointing around climate change.",
      "He urged for a cooperative spirit and suspended ADP 2 at 6:09 pm."
