      "On Monday morning, 15 May, Richard Kinley, Officer-in-Charge of the UNFCCC Secretariat, welcomed delegates, noting that this session marked the beginning of two weeks of UNFCCC-related events, including SB 24, the UNFCCC Dialogue and the Ad Hoc Working Group.",
      "Regarding the Dialogue, he noted submissions from a number of parties, and drew attention to general agreement on the need to strengthen action and to comments on market-based mechanisms.",
      "He explained that implementation of the Kyoto Protocol is moving ahead 'full steam,' with significant actions to achieve the Kyoto targets, although some parties may still need to intensify their efforts.",
      "He also noted approval of 180 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects, with 600 in the pipeline.",
      "He added, however, that funding pledges made at COP/MOP 1 to support the CDM Executive Board had not all yet been honored, and that the Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee had also not received all of its funding.",
      "Highlighting recent progress in work on adaptation, he wished delegates success in their work. Sigmar Gabriel, Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety of Germany, drew attention to discussions at the recent 14th session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD-14), which had highlighted that over 1.6 billion people still lack proper access to energy, and the need to support developing countries to adopt environmentally- friendly energy sources.",
      "He identified the CDM as a good example of North-South cooperation, stressed that recent fluctuations in carbon markets will not affect the market`s importance and viability, and emphasized the European Union`s (EU) goal of restricting climate change to 2o Celsius or less. Rona Ambrose, Canada`s Environment Minister and President of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1, emphasized climate change impacts in Canada`s Arctic regions.",
      "She said that future international cooperation has the possibility to do more than just reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also ensure cleaner air and improved human health.",
      "She underlined the need for a global approach focusing on adaptation, technology and policy instruments, and stressed that all parties must be involved."
