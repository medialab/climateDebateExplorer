      "AWG-KP Chair John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) opened the informal session and introduced the documents (FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/10 and Adds.",
      "He explained that the work would be carried out by informal groups focusing on: Annex I aggregate and individual emission reductions; other issues, including LULUCF and the flexibility mechanisms; potential consequences; and legal matters.",
      "He said the legal matters group would meet as needed.",
      "Chair Ashe highlighted that no informal group meetings would overlap and as many as possible would be open to observers. NEW ZEALAND announced a mid-term target to reduce emissions by 10-20% below 1990 levels by 2020.",
      "He explained that the ambitiousness of the target was contingent on a global agreement to limit temperature rise to 2\u00b0C, comparable commitments from developed countries, efforts from advanced developing countries commensurate with their capabilities, an effective set of rules for LULUCF and full recourse to a broad and efficient carbon market."
