      "The G-77/CHINA stressed that Annex I parties should take economy-wide quantified emission reduction commitments that are ambitious, comparable and compatible with a long-term goal.",
      "He mentioned criteria such as historical responsibility and national capability.",
      "The EU called for a collective reduction of 30% below 1990 levels for developed countries.",
      "He suggested that non-Annex I parties with comparable levels of development consider similar commitments, and supported reviewing progress no later than in 2016.",
      "Highlighting recent science, AOSIS urged stabilization well below 350 ppm to avoid warming of over 1.5\u00b0C, and supported 1990 as the base year.",
      "BOLIVIA identified the need for compensation for climate impacts in developing countries and penalties for non-compliance. NEW ZEALAND presented an Assessing Comparable Efforts Framework to estimate mitigation costs for individual countries, based, inter alia , on mitigation potential and baseline emissions.",
      "SOUTH AFRICA proposed enhancing the compliance system through a new technical panel, and said comparable mitigation efforts should be considered by the COP and COP/MOP for compliance assessment to cover both Protocol parties and non-parties.",
      "INDIA called for agreement on an overall emission reduction target for all Annex I countries under the AWG-LCA, and proposed reductions of at least 40% from 1990.",
      "He said the AWG-LCA should also define quantified emission reduction commitments for Annex I countries that are not Protocol parties, and proposed basing MRV on Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8 (methodological issues, reporting and review).",
      "The US emphasized that there are multiple emission pathways to reach 450 ppm, and highlighted that the US takes a long-term perspective through the development of a comprehensive national cap-and-trade programme with binding interim goals.",
      "He said several criteria can be considered in assessing comparability of efforts, including: per capita emissions; total cost; absolute value; difference from business-as-usual emissions; and multiple baselines.",
      "The US noted that if only the EU and the US were to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050, such actions would still result in 630 ppm, and stressed the need for additional efforts and consideration of the financial component.",
      "The US also specified that their mid-term goal would mean stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels by 2020. TURKEY noted her country s plans to adopt no-lose targets and NAMAs, and stressed differentiation among Annex I parties.",
      "CHINA highlighted increases in Annex I countries emissions since 1990 and high per capita emissions.",
      "He said comparability of efforts should consider policies and measures, actions and targets.",
      "He said targets should be quantified and binding, and that MRV should be conducted through national inventories and communications, and through the relevant Protocol procedures. SUSTAINABLE MARKETS FOUNDATION called for considering the youth in a Copenhagen agreement, moral leadership, and targets for emission reductions which do not compromise the future."
