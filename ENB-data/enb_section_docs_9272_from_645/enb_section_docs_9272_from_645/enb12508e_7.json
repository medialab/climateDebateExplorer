      "At the end of the first week of the Bonn Climate Change Conference, the mood at the Maritim Hotel was noticeably more animated than earlier in the week.",
      "With some 30 contact group meetings and informal consultations scheduled for the day, delegates were no longer complaining about having nothing to do.",
      "Instead they were juggling, as in similar meetings before, trying to be in several places at the same time.",
      "Discussions also continued on ways to enhance the engagement of observer organizations, including by giving them access to certain informal meetings.",
      "Already, some informal groups, including the SBSTA group on methodological guidance for REDD+ and the SBI group on revision of UNFCCC reporting guidelines for Annex I annual inventories, decided to open their doors to observers.",
      "South Africa also welcomed everyone to its informal consultations on parties expectations for Durban.",
      "In certain other groups, however, some parties reportedly preferred to keep the doors closed.",
      "Overall, many, leaving the conference venue in preparation for the NGO/Security party and a Sunday off, seemed more optimistic, albeit cautiously so, about the prospects for Durban.",
      "One insider was enthusiastic about what he described as a new working method: I like this idea of the incoming Presidency involving the chairs of all the groups more than has been done in the past.",
      "Many were also impressed by the number of meetings at different levels scheduled by South Africa between Bonn and Durban .",
      "One commented, however, that, the workload might feel like being in a pressure cooker during the next five months.",
      "Things are definitely looking brighter than they did a couple of days ago, but I still have tempered expectations for Durban, said one negotiator."
