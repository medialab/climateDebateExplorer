      "Chair Karsten Sach said the contact group`s discussions would focus on two sets of issues: preparations for COP/MOP-1; and COP-9, future sessional periods, and effective participation in the UNFCCC process. Regarding preparations for COP/MOP-1, NORWAY said that while it respected the legal distinction between the UNFCCC and the Protocol, it favored as much integration as possible.",
      "The US emphasized the need for an approach that does not merge UNFCCC and Protocol issues as this would impact on the rights of Parties to the UNFCCC that are not members of the Protocol.",
      "The G-77/CHINA underscored the importance of maintaining the UNFCCC and Protocol as separate and distinct bodies, both legally and procedurally.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA, with the US, said that UNFCCC issues should take priority over Protocol issues. On the second set of issues, Chair Sach said that the contact group should consider giving a mandate to the Chairs of the Subsidiary Bodies to consult with Parties on the proposal to streamline agendas, and the multi-year work programme.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA, supported by BRAZIL, SLOVENIA and NORWAY, suggested that these issues be addressed after COP-9."
