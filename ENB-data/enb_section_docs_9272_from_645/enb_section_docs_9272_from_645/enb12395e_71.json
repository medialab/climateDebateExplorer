      "During sessional and intersessional discussions held prior to COP/MOP 4, several issues had been identified for consideration during the second review, including: facilitating procedures for countries to take on emission targets under Protocol Annex B; improving the governance and distribution of the CDM; privileges and immunities; and extending the share of proceeds for adaptation to JI and emissions trading.",
      "At COP/MOP 4, the issue ( FCCC/KP/CMP/2008/6 ; FCCC/KP/CMP/2008/INF.1-3; FCCC/KP/CMP/2008/MISC.1-3; FCCC/SBI/2008/8 & Add.1 and FCCC/TP/2008/6) was first taken up in plenary on 3 and 4 December.",

      "In the COP/MOP plenary on 13 December, following late-night Friends of the Chair and ministerial consultations, COP/MOP President Nowicki announced that these consultations had not resulted in agreement on a comprehensive review.",
      "On the review process, Saudi Arabia, China and others said the review should be completed in Pozna\u00c5\", while the EU, Australia and others identified the need to continue considering some issues under other bodies, such as the SBI.",
      "Consultations on the different aspects of the review took place separately, with an expert drafting group producing what was reported to be agreed text on the scope, effectiveness and functioning of the flexible mechanisms.",
      "On the share of proceeds, many developing countries highlighted the importance of the issue and supported its finalization in Pozna\u00c5\".",
      "Some countries with economies in transition, however, opposed the proposal.",
      "South Africa proposed specific text on a two percent levy on the issuance of assigned amount units (AAUs) and removal units, to be monetized by the Adaptation Fund Board.",
      "The EU put forth less specific text noting the need to develop improved understanding of the financial potentials of available and new mechanisms.",
      "Parties were ultimately unable to reach agreement on the share of proceeds issue, with many developing countries expressing disappointment.",
      "In the early hours of Saturday, 13 December, the COP/MOP agreed to conclude the review without any substantive outcome or document."
