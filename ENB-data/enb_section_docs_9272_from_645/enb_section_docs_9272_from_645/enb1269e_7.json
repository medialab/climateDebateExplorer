      "Observers noted increasing efforts by the United States and others to attack the European Union's positions, particularly on QELROs and the 'bubble.",
      "' The aggressive tone was joined in the corridors by comments that the EU could not sustain a 15 percent target were it not for large emissions reductions unmotivated by climate change concerns and its refusal so far to address all gases.",
      "EU representatives called the critique of the bubble 'a tactic,' but some NGOs said the vehemence of the criticisms compelled them to come to the EU's defense because, they said, the EU wasn't defending itself.",
      "Some observers suggested that a greater threat to the EU's coordination of a group position may be ongoing informal courtship of some EU members by proponents of competing QELROs proposals."
