      "Parties agreed to a proposal by Co-Chairs Rocha and Smith to prepare a co-chairs non-paper to help negotiations in June and to focus at this meeting on narrowing down options, using decision 16/CMP.1 (LULUCF) as the basis.",
      "The EU explained the use of a bar for forest management as an agreed level above which removals would be credited and below which they would be debited.",
      "He said the bar level could be based on historical data on forest management, with alternatives requiring justification, and noted that the bar aims to serve as an incentive for forest management to increase its mitigation potential.",
      "BRAZIL expressed concern with giving a blank check to credits from forest management for compliance before even knowing emission reduction targets, and recalled Brazil s proposal to limit the use of credits from the LULUCF sector for compliance under Protocol Article 3.1.",
      "TUVALU noted that the bar introduces a new fudge factor and urged against the temptation to engineer outcomes. TUVALU, supported by BRAZIL, proposed compulsory accounting for forest biomass decline to ensure carbon stock losses do not go unaccounted for as a result of the definition of forest.",
      "He also proposed including devegetation to balance out accounting for revegetation. CANADA, supported by AUSTRALIA, and opposed by BRAZIL, TUVALU and others, suggested assuming zero emissions or removals for cases of soil carbon saturation in cropland management."
