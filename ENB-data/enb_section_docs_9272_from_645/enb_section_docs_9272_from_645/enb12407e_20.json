      "In its conclusions ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/L.3 ), the AWG-KP, among other things: notes that progress made at AWG-KP 7, as reflected in the annex, could facilitate deliberations at AWG-KP 8; notes that the annex does not capture all of the proposals and options put forward by parties in their submissions and during the discussions at this session; invites submissions from parties by 24 April 2009; agrees to continue its deliberations taking into account the annex to the conclusions, as well as previous and new submissions, in the context of the AWG-KP Chair s text, ; requests that the AWG-KP Chair s text be based on the annex; and encourages parties to share information, particularly data, before AWG-KP 8.",
      "The conclusions include an annex with two options: one for an activity-based approach to accounting for LULUCF on the basis of decision 16/CMP.1; and one for a land-based approach.",
      "A note in the chapeau of the annex explains that the latter option (land-based approach) remains an explicit option and could be further elaborated based on the submissions by parties and the views expressed at AWG-KP 7."
