      "Delegates convened in the morning for the last meeting of this contact group and heard a summary by Co- Chair Plume on how the text had been advanced in the Friends of the Chairs group.",
      "She said the group had met throughout the previous night and that the revised working paper, largely free of brackets, had been completed at 5.30 am on Saturday.",
      "She said many of the remaining brackets are for editorial reasons, some brackets relate to issues where the technical content of the guidelines could not be developed without having received information from other contact groups, and a third set of brackets relate to issues of a political nature spanning the entire negotiating process that might be resolved in the coming week.",
      "Delegates then made editorial changes, as well as a number of drafting proposals to be reflected in the text to be considered by SBSTA later in the day.",
      "Co-Chair Plume concluded the meeting by saying that further work on the guidelines would be undertaken, in one form or the other, during the following week."
