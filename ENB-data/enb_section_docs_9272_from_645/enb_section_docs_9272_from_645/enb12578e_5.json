      "With two days left, the ADP and SBSTA started wrapping up their work in Bonn.",
      "Delegates met throughout the day, but the largest congregations were around the coffee bar to, as one delegate joked, provide an injection of needed inspiration, to speed up the preparation of conclusions for the SBSTA closing plenary on Friday.",
      "Meanwhile, all was quiet on the SBI front.",
      "Under the ADP, parties began to reflect on the way forward.",
      "After the informal plenary, one delegate worried that there was little articulation of the package of decisions necessary at COP 19.",
      "Some also voiced concern that in light of Tuesday s events, it may be difficult to justify sending delegates to climate meetings if no formal negotiations take place.",
      "Others wondered about the focus of COP 19, with one delegate rattling off the many ideas for COP 19: finance COP, loss and damage COP, implementation COP; it seems Warsaw could be many things to many people, evidenced by a lengthening wish list with five months left to go."
