      "Chair Gnapelet summarized the discussions of the working group on cross cutting issues by highlighting that: broad criteria for assessing best practices should be based on the extent to which they effectively fulfill the objectives of the FCCC and the Protocol in a cost-effective manner; lack of comparability of policies and measures across different countries and sectors make it difficult to establish common criteria or indicators; fiscal policies should aim to remove any market imperfections, within the context of fulfilling the desired emissions reductions; and CO2 sequestration should be encouraged. Next steps identified by participants included defining the appropriate context in which best practices could be assessed and encouraging information sharing."
