      "This session was chaired by co-facilitator Sarah Baashan (Saudi Arabia), who proposed labeling paragraphs in option I outlining sub-options for a compliance system in order to clarify their content. A number of parties, including CHINA, CANADA and SAUDI ARABIA expressed reluctance to discuss compliance in-depth before reaching consensus on the legal form of the agreement. The EU noted the usefulness of clarifying possible compliance models before COP 21.",
      "He suggested, and parties agreed, to reorganize the section according to the \"family\" of alternative models contained in the section. Parties also agreed to a proposal by AUSTRALIA to identify \"baskets\" of issues, in order to label the paragraphs.",
      "He suggested the following \"baskets\": purpose; establishment; tools; composition; and mode of work. The EU proposed considering \"higher-level baskets\" in order to reduce their number, namely: establishment and purpose; mandate, scope and structure; and modalities of the arrangements.",
      "Parties will meet informally to agree on these \"baskets\" before the next session of the facilitated group."
