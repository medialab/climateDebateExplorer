   "sentences": [
      "WG-I recommended a number of policy actions to support enabling environments for technology transfer, including: needs assessments; evaluation of existing policies that influence the enabling environment; intra-governmental coordination; protection of intellectual property rights and legal contracts; political support for programmes and institutions that support technology transfer; seed investment programmes to stimulate private sector investment; and capacity building for major stakeholders. Participants also discussed a proposal to place government actions to identify and address barriers to technology transfer in a four- element framework focusing on clarity, consistency, transparency and dissemination. In WG-II, participants pointed out the need for, inter alia: greater communication and interaction between key ministries; delineation of the roles of the private and public sectors in both developed and developing countries; economic incentives targeting industries that are not currently participating in international trade; and ensuring that technology transfer initiatives are compatible with national sustainable development agendas. What role could other stakeholders - such as multilateral lending institutions, bilateral programmes, NGOs, and the private sector - play in creating an enabling environment for technology transfer?",
      "WG-I participants responded to this question by highlighting, inter alia, the engagement of multilateral and bilateral implementing agencies, such as the GEF and regional institutions in creating enabling environments for technology transfer; and building the capacity of regional experts to support technology transfer to least developed countries (LDCs). WG-II stressed the need to identify different roles for each stakeholder, foster awareness among donor agencies of the environmental impacts of their projects, increase dialogue between ministries and donor organizations, and promote cooperation between NGOs and other stakeholders."
