      "The following discussions centered on the importance of outreach regarding the CCS Special Report and IPCC Secretary Christ informed delegates of outreach activities already underway. Germany, with support from many countries and Greenpeace, and opposed by Saudi Arabia, suggested the IPCC consider preparing a special report on renewable energy and energy efficiency.",
      "Some countries said that given the timing and substance of the AR4, the IPCC guidelines for the commencement of special reports, and resource constraints, it was not appropriate to consider such a special report at this time.",
      "Chair Pachauri agreed that due to timing and capacity constraints relating to the AR4, consideration of such a special report should wait until the release of the AR4.",
      "No further action was taken."
