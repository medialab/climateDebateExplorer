      "The issue of cooperative sectoral approaches and sector specific actions was considered on Tuesday and Thursday in an informal sub-group, facilitated by Farrukh Khan (Pakistan).",
      "He noted that certain areas in the revised negotiating text required further clarity, and requested parties to focus on certain questions, including what cooperative sectoral approaches should and should not do, what they should do for Annex I parties and non-Annex I parties, and what should they do for all parties.",
      "Japan emphasized the potential of sectoral approaches to reduce emissions in both developed and developing countries and noted that they help promote technology transfer and capacity building in developing countries.",
      "Brazil, for the G-77/China, said proposed actions in sectors should be voluntary and compatible with an open international economic system.",
      "Saudi Arabia said sectoral approaches should enhance implementation of Convention Article 4.1(c) (development, application and diffusion, including transfer, of technologies).",
      "He said they should not be used to set sectoral goals or targets or compare sector-specific actions between countries or regions.",
      "India said all proposals must relate to Convention Article 4.1(c), and opposed harmonization of sectoral standards.",
      "The EU said opportunities to increase efficiency and sustainability through sectoral approaches should not be ignored, and said the shipping and aviation sectors should be included in a global agreement.",
      "Norway and Singapore suggested that the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) update the group on recent activities, while Saudi Arabia opposed.",
      "India said they should explain how these proposals embody common but differentiated responsibilities, and how they relate to Convention Article 4.1(c).",
      "The IMO noted 75% of ships in international trade are registered in non-Annex I countries, implying massive technology transfer for these ships, and said that funds generated under market-based approaches would be used for climate change purposes in developing countries.",
      "ICAO reported on the programme of action on aviation and climate change.",
      "Several parties, including Norway and Singapore, supported inviting ICAO and the IMO to Bangkok to answer parties questions; this was opposed by Saudi Arabia.",
      "Algeria, for the African Group, said sectoral approaches were best applied at the national level and, regarding the aviation sector, said additional constraints or incremental costs should not be imposed on developing countries.",
      "Australia said sectoral approaches can assist parties in meeting obligations, but that they should not replace economy-wide commitments or be imposed on countries.",
      "The US noted that expertise resides at the sectoral level, which provides a good vehicle to promote cooperation.",
      "Tuvalu said the section on sectoral approaches could be simplified and should not be too prescriptive or highlight specific sectors, with the exception of bunker fuels.",
      "During the second meeting, parties considered a non-paper that structured proposals and ideas on objectives, scope and policy guidelines around the five questions.",
      "Facilitator Khan also presented a non-non-paper, explaining that it aimed to structure and bring further clarity to the text.",
      "He also identified questions for consideration, including: nature of sectors; level of guidance; and integration in the climate change regime.",
      "Norway and others requested that the questions be made available before Bangkok.",
      "Several parties welcomed the non-paper while expressing reservations about the non-non-paper."
