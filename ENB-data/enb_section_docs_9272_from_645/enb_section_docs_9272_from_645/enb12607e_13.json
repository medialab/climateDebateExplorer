      "Commenting on this section in general, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bolivia, and China expressed concern that sustainable development was not emphasized enough and requested use of approved language from WGIII.",

      "Regarding the title of this section, Bolivia proposed replacing 'Transformations and changes in systems', with 'Climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development'.",
      "Authors suggested 'Future pathways for adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development'.",
      "Switzerland objected, favoring the original formulation, noting 'transformation' is one of the new concepts introduced in AR5 and had already been communicated in the WG reports.",
      "Following additional discussions, participants accepted the proposed reformulation as revised by the authors.",
      "Final SYR SPM Text: The headline for this section states that adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks of climate change, and that substantial emission reductions over the next few decades can: reduce climate risks in the 21st century and beyond; increase prospects for effective adaptation; reduce mitigation costs and challenges in the longer term; and contribute to climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development."
