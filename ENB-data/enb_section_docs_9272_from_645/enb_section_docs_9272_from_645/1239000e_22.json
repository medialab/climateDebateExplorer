   "sentences": [
      "On Agenda Item 4(b), Possible revisions to the guidelines for the preparation of communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, the Secretariat introduced three documents.",
      "Documents FCCC/SBSTA/1996/9/Add.1 and Add.2 highlight electricity trade, bunker fuels, use of global warming potentials (GWPs), accounting for land-use change and forestry, temperature adjustments, and present options for action.",
      "Document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/MISC.5 contains comments from Parties. The MARSHALL ISLANDS, NORWAY, MICRONESIA and INDIA favored deferring consideration of this issue and requesting Parties to submit comments.",
      "The MARSHALL ISLANDS and INDIA said they would allow provision of supplementary information based on the documents.",
      "AUSTRALIA supported the revisions to guidelines but called for work on defining anthropogenic emissions. The issue of adjustment was raised not only regarding temperature adjustment, but also regarding electricity trade and bunker fuels.",
      "Unadjusted reporting was generally preferred, with supplemental adjusted figures.",
      "DENMARK noted that his country experiences random electricity emissions fluctuations due to climatic factors.",
      "He supported the continued use of reporting on actual, as well as adjusted levels of emissions, to correct for these fluctuations. On the electricity trade, the US noted inconsistencies in reporting on imports and exports due to ad hoc adjustments, and called for emissions accounting where generated.",
      "Data on the trade and related emissions should be supplemental.",
      "He proposed that the Secretariat prepare a paper on electricity trading.",
      "AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND also favored the use of unadjusted figures.",
      "AUSTRALIA noted that electricity trading is part of the general issue of trade in high carbon intensive commodities. On international bunker fuels, the US recommended unadjusted inventories but said supplemental data could include averaging over some period in order to estimate progress towards targets.",
      "Supported by NORWAY, he noted the need for a methodology for consistent emissions allocation.",
      "The US and NEW ZEALAND recommended narrowing the number of options for further action.",
      "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION also urged further work, particularly with other international organizations.",
      "MICRONESIA sought clarification on bunker fuels with regard to regionally- specific emission factors and suggested a roundtable on bunker fuels for SBSTA-5. On temperature adjustments, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, INDIA and JAPAN favored unadjusted emissions reporting in inventories and a separate method for treating adjustments.",
      "JAPAN called for a unified approach to be discussed by the IPCC.",
      "AUSTRALIA highlighted that temperature adjustments are based on cyclical fluxes like other climatic events and, therefore, should follow the same conceptual approach.",
      "He proposed developing common national performance indicators within SBSTA`s work programmme and having countries use these along with specific national ones. On global warming potentials (GWPs), INDIA expressed concern about inconsistencies in their use and asked for comparability in reports.",
      "JAPAN suggested that Parties using GWPs utilize the GWP guidelines adopted at COP-2, but preferred reporting on GHGs gas-by-gas.",
      "NEW ZEALAND echoed this call for caution on GWP use. On land use and forestry, MICRONESIA called for clearer definitions.",
      "AUSTRALIA noted that P&Ms cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of GHGs and, therefore, favored aggregating activities in all sectors for a 'net' emissions figure.",
      "However, JAPAN noted methodological problems in this category and NEW ZEALAND said the issue of subtraction depends on resolving other issues.",
      "Both JAPAN and NEW ZEALAND favored the 'net approach', but until these problems are resolved JAPAN stated a preference for use of gross figures."
