      "The key question for many delegates arriving at the Palais des Nations on Thursday was whether to proceed with streamlining of the Geneva text or accept what had already been achieved.",
      "The ADP informal consultations in the morning started with two apparent scores by the LMDCs and Australia, as both agreed to withdraw some of their proposed additions to the text.",
      "Some other delegates felt, however, it was better to call offsides and ensure that the Geneva text would be taken home without adding or deleting anything.",
      "This was perceived as a necessary reassurance that parties are all on one team.",
      "As it became clear that no changes would be made to the Geneva text, delegates started thinking about what they might still achieve.",
      "Many seemed happy with what they characterized as productive discussions in the afternoon on cycles in the new agreement: We are definitely heading in the right direction, explained one delegate, moving into a more interactive exchange of ideas.",
      "In anticipation of Friday, many delegates said they hoped to reach clear agreement on how to start working on the text at the next ADP session in Bonn.",
      "We want to get straight to work in June, said one negotiator."
