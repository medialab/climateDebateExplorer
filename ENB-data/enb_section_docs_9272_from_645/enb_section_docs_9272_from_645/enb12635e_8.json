      "On Monday, with many new delegates arriving at the World Conference Center Bonn for the final days of negotiations, there was widespread convergence on the need to start negotiating the text for the new agreement. During the morning\u00a7s ADP stocktaking exercise, a sense of urgency seemed to be growing with many parties searching for ways to pick up the pace.",
      "Some parties called for the ADP Co-Chairs to craft a consolidated text and others urged raising the number of negotiating days before Paris.",
      "Some called it \"healthy\" for delegates to recognize the limitations of a purely party-driven approach, and turn the text to the Co-Chairs for further streamlining. Another reality check came in the afternoon\u00a7s facilitated discussions, where, as one observer remarked, \"little seems to have changed.\" Though many appreciated the new \"tool\" provided by the co-facilitators in the time frame group and parties keeping discussions \"at the right level,\" in other groups one lamented the reappearance of entrenched positions, as soon as matters of substance appeared on the surface."
