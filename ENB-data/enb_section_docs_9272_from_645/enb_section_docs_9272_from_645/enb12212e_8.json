      "Scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change, and scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation: MALAYSIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, said the TAR`s conclusions should be used cautiously.",
      "CHINA noted the 'widespread suspicion or disagreement' associated with some of the conclusions and suggested that SBSTA request further comments from the IPCC regarding those conclusions.",
      "SWITZERLAND said that the TAR should be routinely considered in all agenda items and, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, suggested that future annotated agendas should reference the TAR.",
      "AUSTRALIA, with CANADA, the EU and AOSIS, supported discussions on the TAR as a separate agenda item.",
      "AOSIS also noted that SBSTA had so far failed to successfully integrate the TAR`s findings into its work.",
      "CANADA emphasized the need for discussions on cross-cutting issues relating to both adaptation and mitigation.",
      "A contact group co-chaired by David Warrilow (UK) and Walid Al- Malik (UAE) will further discuss these issues."
