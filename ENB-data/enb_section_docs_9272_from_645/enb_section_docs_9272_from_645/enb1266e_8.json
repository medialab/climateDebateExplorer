      "On 20 October, SBI Vice-Chair Jos\u00e9 Romero (Switzerland), on behalf of SBI Chair Mahmoud Ould El-Ghaouth (Mauritania), reminded delegates of the short time allocated for SBI negotiations at this session and urged them to conclude in a timely manner. FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit-Cutajar noted the need for support in developing initial national communications and strengthening national capacities.",
      "He noted that projects for national communications can 'prime the pump' for future investments as much as pilot projects for lowering emissions.",
      "Regarding the FCCC core budget, he noted a number of delinquent contributions and additional contributions to the trust fund for participation were needed. Delegates adopted the SBI agenda (FCCC/SBI/1997/17)."
