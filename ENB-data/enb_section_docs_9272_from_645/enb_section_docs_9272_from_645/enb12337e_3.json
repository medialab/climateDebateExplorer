      "In the corridors, many delegates discussed the series of bilaterals conducted by the AWG Chair in the run-up to the AWG contact group as well as the draft conclusions, distributed on Wednesday evening.",
      "While some delegates saw the text as a good starting point, others believed that tactical issues had come into play to influence the format.",
      "Some Annex I delegates indicated that they had hoped to achieve more on the identification of potentials and ranges for possible emission reductions at the Vienna session but saw this as increasingly unlikely on Wednesday as differences, for example, over the future role and development of flexible mechanisms entered the equation.",
      "Other delegates expressed a preference for modest conclusions from Vienna, as the alternative might result in taking forward a bracketed text to Bali.",
      "As one observer commented: If they can t agree, then let them say so.",
      "Most delegates anticipate further discussion on references to stabilization pathways and other issues in the chair draft when informal negotiations reconvene Thursday."
