      "Those familiar with the dynamics of glacier and ice movement know that, as with other natural systems, changes in some parts - even small changes - can lead to a sequence of events that results in significant consequences.",
      "In the case of the Wilkins Ice Shelf, for example, it was the snap of an ice bridge that is leading to the wider break-up of the Ice Shelf.",
      "In the post-2012 negotiations, it may also be that if one aspect of the negotiations were to advance, other pieces might also start falling into place.",
      "If there is one thing that characterizes the Bali Roadmap negotiations, it is the amount of interconnections.",
      "Indeed, procedural interlinkages and the ensuing challenges are increasingly evident.",
      "Developing countries stress that serious progress on numbers for developed countries and financial support is required before they are willing to discuss mitigation action.",
      "But some developed countries were also in their own waiting game - arguing for consistency between the two AWGs and waiting for major developing countries and the US to express their commitments.",
      "Intimately related to mitigation commitments are new and existing market mechanisms and rules for accounting for LULUCF.",
      "Many were waiting for these rules to be resolved before targets are set, and are speculating about the implications for the US - a Protocol non-party who cannot fully participate in the formulation of rules on LULUCF and flexibility mechanisms.",
      "As most expected, substantive progress with respect to these issues remained slow and, in fact, hardly moved at all."
