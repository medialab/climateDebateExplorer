      "He reported that the meeting drew 55 participants from within and outside the IPCC, including 24 from developing countries, who considered recommendations on opportunities and options for pursuing this agenda in the future, including concentrating on new research, undertaking a possible SR, and incorporating new thinking and learning about this issue area into the scoping for AR6.",
