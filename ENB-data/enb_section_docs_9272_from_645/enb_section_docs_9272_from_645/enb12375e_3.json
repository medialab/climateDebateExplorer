      "This issue was addressed in an AWG-LCA contact group on 9 June.",

      "Switzerland, for the Environmental Integrity Group, said a shared vision should provide a framework for cooperation among all parties, and include a long-term climate objective and ways and means to reach it.",
      "South Africa, for the African Group, said an aspirational goal would be acceptable if underpinned by binding and ambitious targets for developed countries, including targets of 25-40% below 1990 levels by 2020, and at least 50% by 2050.",

      "Bangladesh, for the LDCs, said a shared vision should include the right of developing countries to sustainable development and highlighted the need for adaptation policies, including risk reduction strategies.",
      "Malaysia and Pakistan suggested analyzing the implications of Annex I countries different emissions targets for non-Annex I parties.",
      "Brazil suggested a long-term goal based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, historical responsibility and the best available science.",
