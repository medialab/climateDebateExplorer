      "Delegates considered this issue on Wednesday, 26 September.",
      "Chair Watson recalled that IPCC-17 had approved the preparation of a technical paper on climate change and biological diversity, as requested by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).",
      "Habiba Gitay, convening lead author, introduced the scoping paper for the Technical Paper.",
      "She explained that the technical paper would only draw on existing IPCC material, and noted that, in response to a request from the SBSTA, it would also look at links between climate change and desertification.",
      "She emphasized that the report would be written by members of the CBD roster of experts in conjunction with IPCC authors in order to ensure coordination. Widespread support was expressed for the scoping paper.",
      "Some delegates sought clarification on its approach and content, and others suggested specific topics that should be fully covered, including: mountain area biodiversity; adaptation; and biodiversity in countries particularly vulnerable to climate change and to climate change mitigation action listed in UNFCCC Article 4.8.",
      "One representative expressed concern that the focus on biodiversity should not lead to a neglect of desertification. In summarizing the discussion, Chair Watson encouraged developing countries to nominate authors for the paper to ensure that issues of specific concern to them will be adequately addressed.",
      "Delegates approved the scoping paper."
