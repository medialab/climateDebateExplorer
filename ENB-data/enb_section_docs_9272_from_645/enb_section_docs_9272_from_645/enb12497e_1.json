      "During the morning informal consultations, parties continued considering a draft COP/MOP decision paragraph-by-paragraph.",

      "One party noted that his country is not in a position to accept any text that deals with emission reductions achieved after 2012.",
      "A number of parties proposed alternative formulations to address the issue, such as requesting the AWG-KP to: propose options for addressing a potential gap between the first and second commitment periods and present the work to COP/MOP 7; or consider the JI Supervisory Committee s proposal with regard to the generation of ERUs after 31 December 2012.",
      "Regarding the introduction of a fee for JI Track 1 projects, parties considered various textual formulations and proposals for the level of the fee.",
      "Consensus eventually emerged on a fee and review of JI.",
