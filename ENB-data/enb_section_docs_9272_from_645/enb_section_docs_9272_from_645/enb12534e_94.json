      "Saudi Arabia stressed the need for text on response measures that reflects progress across all areas of the negotiations and, supported by Iraq, expressed concern that response measures have not received as much attention as mitigation under the AWG-LCA.",
      "During the second week, parties considered a consolidated text based on parties submissions, language on response measures within the Chair s amalgamation document (FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/CRP.37/Add.1), and other relevant documents.",
