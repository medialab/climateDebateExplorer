      "Participants began by discussing the finance section of the Co-Chairs' Note.",
      "On funding and resource levels, delegates discussed the questions addressing President Pronk's proposed Adaptation and Special Climate Change funds.",
      "Options include whether contributions to the funds should be voluntary or mandatory and who should contribute; whether non-payment should have consequences; and whether the GEF should establish and manage the Special Climate Change fund.",
      "Questions on the Special Climate Change fund also address: whether activities related to economic diversification and measures for mitigation should be included, and whether non-Annex I Parties would be required to implement national strategies for mitigation and sequestration as a condition for accessing new and additional funding from the fund. General agreement was achieved on some aspects, and a consultation group facilitated by Philippe Roch (Switzerland) was convened to consider the questions further.",
      "This consultation group will report back to the main negotiating group tomorrow.",
      "Remaining issues to be discussed include technology transfer and adverse effects."
