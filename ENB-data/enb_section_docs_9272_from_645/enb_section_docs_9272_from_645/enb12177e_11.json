      "The approved answer states that models project an increase in daily, seasonal, inter-annual and decadal climate variability, as well as changes in frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme climate events.",
      "It also states that greenhouse gas forcing in the 21st century could set in motion abrupt/non- linear changes in physical and biological systems over the coming decades to millennia, with a wide range of associated likelihoods.",
      "Further, the answer stipulates that some of the projected changes in physical systems and in the natural sources and sinks of greenhouse gases could be irreversible, but there is an incomplete understanding of some of the underlying processes.",
      "Changes in climate could increase the risk of such changes in many ecosystems.",
      "A table gives examples of climate variability and extreme climate events, and examples of their impacts."
