      "In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.4), SBSTA, inter alia: recognizes progress made by the GCOS Secretariat in developing the 5-10 year implementation plan for the integrated global observing systems for climate, in particular the publication of the draft implementation plan for open review; urges the GCOS Secretariat, in finalizing this plan, to clearly identify priorities for actions, taking into account the views expressed by Parties and relevant international programmes and bodies; welcomes the collaboration between GCOS and the ad hoc Group on Earth Observations in developing their respective implementation plans, and urges both bodies to integrate them to the extent possible; emphasizes the need to treat global climate monitoring as a priority within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems; encourages Parties to continue pursuing the implementation of elements of the regional action plans developed under the GCOS regional workshop programme; and invites the GCOS Secretariat to report on progress made in implementing the regional action plans in relation to global observing systems for climate, including support from the UNFCCC`s financial mechanism and other bilateral and multilateral agencies and mechanisms, for consideration by SBSTA-21 and subsequent sessions, as appropriate. The SBSTA conclusions note the ongoing development of the GCOS Cooperation Mechanism to address priority needs for improvements in global observing systems for climate in developing countries, and in particular the plans to develop an inventory of donor activities relating to global observing systems for climate.",
      "SBSTA invites the GCOS Secretariat, in consultation with the WMO, to provide its full report on data exchange problems for consideration by SBSTA-22.",
      "In particular, SBSTA encourages the inclusion of options to remedy existing data exchange problems and advice on problems associated with the accessibility of data by and from global data centers. SBSTA welcomes the exchange of views during the SBSTA-20 event on research in response to the IPCC Third Assessment Report.",
      "The following are noted as requiring further consideration: the need to assess the adequacy of research activities and their international coordination to meet the needs of the UNFCCC; the importance of social, as well as natural, sciences, and the interaction between the two, in responding to the research needs arising from the assessment reports of the IPCC; and the enhancement of the capacity of developing countries to contribute to, and participate in, global climate change research efforts. SBSTA requests Parties to submit to the Secretariat, by 15 September 2004, their views on how to address the main issues from the SBSTA-20 event adequately, for consideration by SBSTA-21.",
      "SBSTA requests Parties to submit to the Secretariat additional views on this subject by 24 January 2005 for consideration by SBSTA-22.",
      "It requests the Secretariat to compile both sets of submissions into miscellaneous documents and to prepare a synthesis of Parties` views for consideration by SBSTA-22."
