      "IPCC Chair Bob Watson said the first question relating to project-based activities was whether or not to include sinks in the CDM and, if they are included, which ones to allow.",
      "Sandra Brown, IPCC Special Report Lead Author, provided information on, inter alia: development of baselines, which can be project- specific or generic, and fixed or regularly updated; leakage, which refers to cases where the benefits of a project are canceled out through the shift of the unwanted activity, such as deforestation, to a site outside the project boundaries; approaches to accounting for and mitigation of leakage; permanence; and measuring, monitoring and verification of selected pools. Watson noted that these issues must also be addressed in energy projects, while observing that the question of permanence is considered more difficult for LULUCF projects."
