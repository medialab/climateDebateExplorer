      "On Tuesday morning, the ADP completed its first consideration of the text.",
      "Instead of the anticipated eight meetings, this was accomplished in only five contact group meetings.",
      "Many remarked, however, that the text had also ballooned by over 200%.",
      "The afternoon session was characterized by a procedural focus as parties discussed how to approach the challenging task of streamlining the text.",
      "After such good progress during the first days, it was only inevitable that we needed to have a procedural discussion before moving to the next stage, commented one delegate.",

      "Meanwhile, many attending the TEP appreciated the cooperative spirit and its reach beyond national governments to non-state actors.",
      "For once, it s nice to focus in good atmosphere on those many exciting things happening around the world on climate change."
