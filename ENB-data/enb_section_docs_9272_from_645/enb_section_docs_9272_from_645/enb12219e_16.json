      "In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.3), the SBSTA notes the possible inclusion of methods to estimate the change in carbon stored in harvested wood products as an annex or appendix to the IPCC report on good practice guidance for LULUCF, and requests the IPCC to submit a report on this subject for consideration by SBSTA-19, as well as to organize a side-event on good practice guidance for LULUCF during SBSTA-19.",
      "It also notes that issues related to harvested wood products will continue to be considered at SBSTA-19 and subsequent sessions.",
      "The SBSTA also requests the Secretariat, in consultation with the IPCC, to prepare draft common reporting formats for LULUCF for consideration at SBSTA-19, and invites the IPCC to report progress on the development of practicable methodologies and effects due to past practices in forests at SBSTA-19, including plans for a review process."
