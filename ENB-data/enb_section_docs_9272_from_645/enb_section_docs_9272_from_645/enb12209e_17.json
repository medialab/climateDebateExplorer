The COP draft decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.29/Add.1) requests the SBSTA Chair to conduct consultations and ensure collaboration among expert groups on the cross-cutting issues of their work programmes, including issues relating to technology transfer and capacity building; and calls on SBSTA-19 to consider innovative ways to address outcomes of the technology needs assessments under the EGTT work programme."
