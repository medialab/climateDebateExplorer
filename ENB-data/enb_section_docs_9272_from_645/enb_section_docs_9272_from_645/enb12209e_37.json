      "In the draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.26 and Add.1), Parties decide that: non-Annex I Parties should use the guidelines contained in the annex for the preparation of second and, where appropriate, third national communications, except where Parties have initiated the process of preparing second national communications; the guidelines should be used to provide guidance to an operating entity of the financial mechanism for funding the preparation of national communications; and COP-9 shall determine the frequency of submissions. The decision also invites non-Annex I Parties wishing to use elements from the guidelines for Annex I national communications to do so."
