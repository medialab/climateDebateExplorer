      "During informal consultations, delegates focused on the sub-item on the CGE.",
      "Differences over the mandate of a reconstituted CGE emerged, particularly over the basis for discussions.",
      "While developing countries and some Annex I parties thought that the old mandate and terms of reference (decision 3/CP.8) could form the basis for discussions, other Annex I parties argued that the situation had changed considerably in light of the Bali outcomes, and objected to using this earlier text.",
      "Parties ultimately agreed that the Co-Chairs would draft text based both on decision 3/CP.8, and on new elements suggested by parties.",
      "Delegates also debated a suggestion from some Annex I parties for the CGE to work on MRV, with many others saying this was an issue for the AWG-LCA, not SBI.",
      "Further consultations will take place on Saturday."
