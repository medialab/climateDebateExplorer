      "Co-Chair Djoghlaf opened the plenary saying that ADP 2-9 enabled parties to make progress by putting in place the \"mechanics\" that will facilitate a successful and timely outcome in Paris.",
      "He stated that the success of the session should be measured by the trust built and the fact that \"nobody was left behind.\" UNFCCC Deputy Executive Secretary Richard Kinley reported on the funding gap for arrangements for the additional August/September and October ADP sessions, noting recent pledges from various parties. Recapping the agreed way forward, Co-Chair Djoghlaf reiterated that the Geneva negotiating text remains the only official document and that the Co-Chairs will produce the additional tool without omitting or deleting any options or party positions. Representing the COP 20 Presidency, Jorge Voto-Bernales, Peru, commended the ADP Co-Chairs for their intensive consultations, and encouraged parties to seek to reduce options in each section of the negotiating text. Representing the incoming, COP 21 Presidency, Laurence Tubiana, France, congratulated parties on their hard work and emphasized trust as a condition for success.",
