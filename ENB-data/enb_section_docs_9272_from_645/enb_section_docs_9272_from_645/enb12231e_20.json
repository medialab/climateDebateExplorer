      "In the conclusions (FCCC/ SBSTA/2003/L.20), SBSTA: takes note of the report on the development of the data exchange standards and the transaction log; stresses the need for the Secretariat to focus attention on the transaction log, and to continue pursuing means to reduce the funding requirements associated with the development of the transaction log; and urges Annex II Parties to make exceptional efforts to contribute to the supplemental Trust Fund to allow the necessary work on the development of the transaction log to start at the beginning of 2004 and be completed before COP-10.",
      "SBSTA also urged each Party listed in Protocol Annex B, which has not already designated its registry administrator to maintain its national registry, to do so as soon as possible, with a view to facilitating early cooperation on the development of registries and the transaction log."
