      "During informal consultations, parties discussed the new Chairs text on possible options for amendments to LULUCF definitions, modalities, rules and guidelines and began to draft conclusions.",
      "The new text elaborates five options, each with, inter alia , different versions of forest management accounting under Article 3.4 (additional activities).",
      "Many parties maintained that the five options should not be considered as packages, but as classes of options from which elements may be drawn.",
      "Parties also stressed the importance of future discussion of non-forest-management land-use activities under Article 3.4.",
      "One negotiating group stressed that the principles of decision 16/CMP.1 (LULUCF) should be retained without amendment.",
      "A developed country party expressed concern with the absence of land temporarily out of accounting from the options, and, opposed by others, proposed removal of text specifying that activities under Article 3.4 be compulsory if they were accounted for in the first commitment period.",
      "Another party proposed removing caps on Article 3.4 activities from all options.",
      "Though some parties proposed deleting the option involving a single-year baseline for net-net accounting, the Chairs preferred not to remove options at this point so that each could be further elaborated.",
      "On the conclusions, parties discussed whether to retain reference to Annex IV (options and issues for consideration) of the last AWG-KP report ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/3 ).",
      "The Chairs will incorporate comments and draft a new text for consideration on Tuesday."
