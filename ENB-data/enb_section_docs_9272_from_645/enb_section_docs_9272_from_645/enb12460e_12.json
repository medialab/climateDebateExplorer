      "The remainder of 2010 is set to be very busy, with four sessions of the AWGs planned for the rest of the year.",
      "Whatever progress is made at the June meeting will likely set the tone for the rest of the year, particularly in terms of reactions to the AWG-LCA Chair s draft text.",
      "Despite the goodwill at this meeting, it is clear that a lack of trust among parties remains a potentially strong undercurrent in the negotiations.",
      "While the difficulty of coming to agreement on a topic as banal as the organization and methods of work may provide fuel for those who expect few results from the UNFCCC, there was acknowledgement in the room of past mistakes and the need to avoid repeating them.",
      "Parties demonstrated a commitment to finishing the session s work, rather than living with deadlock and postponing necessary choices for the next meeting in Bonn in little over a month.",
      "If parties can maintain this commitment to completing specific work at each session, and build trust through continued discussion and compromise then the prospects for Canc\u00fan are encouraging."
