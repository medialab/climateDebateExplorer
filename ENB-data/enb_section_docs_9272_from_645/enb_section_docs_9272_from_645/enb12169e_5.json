      "With the high-level ministerial meeting starting Thursday, participants have been considering the likely strategies of the key negotiating groups.",
      "While there was speculation that those committed to a 'strong' Protocol would need to compromise heavily to keep the treaty alive, some non-governmental participants thought these Parties might take a different, tougher approach to 'preserve the Protocol's environmental integrity' and 'shame' others into joining.",
      "However, even some veterans to the process admitted uncertainty on what the most effective strategy might be. Meanwhile, several observers were detecting further hardening of positions among groups, pointing to the resurrection of issues such as nuclear projects in the CDM, that many thought had been resolved in The Hague.",
      "The more optimistic commentators dismissed this as merely posturing aimed at creating greater 'negotiating capital' prior to the high-level talks.",
