      "The G-77/China, the European Community (EC), Japan, the US and Canada were among those giving press briefings.",
      "The G-77/China reiterated the need to preserve the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as defined in the FCCC and indicated that the US proposal on 'voluntary but binding' commitments for developing countries counter to this principle. The EC said that there was growing consensus regarding a 5- year time frame for 'budget periods,' but indicated that further consultations were needed to determine when the first budget period would begin.",
      "He spoke of differentiation based on a 0 - 5% range of reductions of emissions.",
      "However, he indicated that the EU was not in a position to accept this range because a ministerial decision would be needed to change the QELROs target it had set for itself. The Japanese briefing emphasized that differentiation should acknowledge equivalence of efforts by different countries, and that additional criteria could be discussed within that framework.",
      "He pointed out that the 'floor to ceiling' differentiation of 0 - 5% that had been discussed reflected the Japanese proposal.",
      "The US indicated that joint implementation with credits is a least-cost win-win solution."
