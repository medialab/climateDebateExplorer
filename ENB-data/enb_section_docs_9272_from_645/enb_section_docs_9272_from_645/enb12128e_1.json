      "John Ashe (Antigua & Barbuda), Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), said the goal of the informal meetings was to make substantial progress and provide textual proposals for the formal SB-12 sessions, taking place from 12-16 June.",
      "He noted that the week's informal discussions would address: guidelines under Protocol Articles 5,7 and 8; the Protocol mechanisms; compliance; FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14; policies and measures; land use, land-use change and forestry; and the development and transfer of technology. On the issue of technology transfer, Harald Dovland (Norway), Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), noted that the Friends of the Chair group, established at a previous SBSTA session, could accept more members, and would at some stage become a contact group, possibly at SB-13.",
      "NIGERIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, noted the technology concerns of developing countries and called for the immediate formation of a contact group."
