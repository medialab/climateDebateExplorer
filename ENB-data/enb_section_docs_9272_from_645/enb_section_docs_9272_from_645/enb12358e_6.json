      "On the opening day of the meeting, many were surprised to see crowded corridors with more than 1,000 participants, including over 100 accredited media, given that the meeting was expected to be an organizational one to determine the AWGLCA s work programme.",
      "In a changing climate from the exceptionally hot streets of Bangkok to the chilly air-conditioned UN Conference Center the delegates mood was positive, and some commended delegates willingness to work constructively and leave the political compromises reached in Bali untouched.",
