      "In its conclusions (FCCC/KP/AWG/2007/L.6/Rev.1), the AWG: recalls its work should be guided by a shared vision of the challenge set by the ultimate objective of the Convention; notes the usefulness of the ranges in IPCC Working Group III's contribution to AR4 and that this report indicates that global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak within the next 10-15 years and be reduced well below half of 2000 levels by the middle of the twenty-first century; recognizes that achieving the lowest stabilization scenarios assessed by the IPCC would require Annex I parties as a group to reduce emissions in a range of 25-40% below 1990 levels by 2020; decides to hold the first part of its fifth session in March or April 2008 and resume it in June 2008; identifies the tasks and preparatory process for both parts of the fifth session, including two in-session workshops, submissions and an information note by the Secretariat; decides to hold the first part of its sixth session in August or September 2008 and resume it in December 2008; outlines the preparatory process for both parts of the sixth session, including submissions and an updated technical paper; identifies the tasks for both parts of the sixth session, including an in-session workshop, adopting conclusions and considering the work programme for 2009; decides to hold its seventh and eighth sessions in 2009; identifies the tasks that it aims to carry out at those sessions, including forwarding the relevant draft decisions on further Annex I commitments to COP/MOP 5 for its adoption; and requests the Secretariat to schedule all meetings under the AWG, to the extent possible, in conjunction with other UNFCCC meetings.",
