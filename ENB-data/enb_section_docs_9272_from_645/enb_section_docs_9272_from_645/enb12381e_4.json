      "During informal consultations, AWG-LCA Chair Machado observed that the 2008 programme had centered on exchanging ideas, but that the focus in 2009 should be on negotiating.",
      "He made three proposals for a Chair s paper to move the process forward in Poznan: a compilation of proposals from parties; a non-paper containing possible elements of a Copenhagen agreement; and a draft negotiating text.",
      "Many parties expressed preference for the first option.",
      "One party objected to the first proposal, questioning the added value of compiling views that are available on the Secretariat website, while another suggested a combination of the first two options.",
      "Parties proposed workshops on:specific elements of sectoral approaches; mitigation in the agriculture sector; greenhouse gas inventories; impacts of response measures; and developed country mitigation commitments and developing country mitigation actions.",
      "Most parties stressed the importance of limiting the number of workshops.",
      "Parties considered a proposal to establish a group to address legal issues pertaining to the AWG-LCA, such as the six-month rule on the circulation of documents, and amendments to the Kyoto Protocol.",
      "Some parties opposed this, and Vice-Chair Cutajar suggested that the need for such a group had not yet arisen."
