      "This group was facilitated by Crispin D Auvergne (Saint Lucia).",
      "On a permanent forum, to address the issue of the impact of the implementation of response measures, parties considered: the need to establish a forum; its potential structure and functions; the possibility of using existing mechanisms rather than establishing a separate forum; and whether consideration should be restricted to consequences experienced in developing countries.",
      "On trade-related measures, parties discussed the need for international consensus on measures that would have an effect on international trade, in particular on developing country exports and ensuring that climate change trade-related measures taken by developed countries do not transfer the burden of mitigation to developing countries or limit their social or economic development.",
      "Discussions were reflected in revisions to the negotiating text (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/14)."
