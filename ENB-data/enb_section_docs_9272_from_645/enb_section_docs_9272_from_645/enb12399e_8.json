      "Plus \u00e7a change, plus c est la m\u00eame chose, (the more it changes, the more it s the same) a participant was heard muttering as he left one of the day s contact groups.",
      "Others were heard voicing similar concerns, complaining that discussions tended to reiterate well-known positions, even though many had come to Bonn with high hopes of entering a fresh phase in the process.",
      "While a feeling of weariness seemed to be infiltrating the corridors, some were quick to point out that this was only the second day of the meeting.",
      "Many were also optimistic about the AWG-LCA discussions on adaptation.",
      "Familiar ideas but presented in a more constructive form, was how one participant described the day s two contact group sessions on the topic.",
      "Those emerging from the AWG-KP plenary were also relieved that a satisfactory compromise had been found so quickly in response to the G-77/China s concerns over the organization of work.",
      "Even further reasons for optimism included a new coffee machine in the Maritim Hotel cafeteria, perhaps providing the extra energy that would be needed to plow ahead.",
      "After the AWG-LCA Chair s brief informal consultations on Monday evening, it seemed evident that more energy would be needed also later in the year: Several delegates were overheard talking about the inevitability of further sessions in 2009, although yet to be agreed upon.",
      "A few were even seen scanning real estate pages in the local newspaper as they contemplated the need to move their home to Bonn for the next several months."
