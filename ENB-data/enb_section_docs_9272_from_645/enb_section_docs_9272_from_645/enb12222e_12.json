      "The IPCC outlined progress on the revision of the Revised 1996 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) updated SBSTA on ICAO`s work on aviation emissions.",
      "ARGENTINA called for the identification of options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from civil aviation. The EU noted the increase in emissions from international aviation and maritime transportation by 48% in the past ten years, and proposed that SBSTA work with ICAO to achieve further progress in this area.",
      "TUVALU urged a more proactive role than information gathering on emissions from aviation and maritime transportation and requested the Chair to initiate a process for mitigating emissions from this sector.",
      "JAPAN said revised methodologies should be used by all Parties, and stressed the importance of equity in this regard.",
      "AUSTRALIA encouraged SBSTA to support programmes for improving maritime and aviation emissions estimates, and supported a comparison of aviation fuel and emissions data with ICAO models. Chair Thorgeirsson requested Helen Plume (New Zealand) to conduct informal consultations on the matter, and said the issue would be taken up by SBSTA on Tuesday, 9 December."
