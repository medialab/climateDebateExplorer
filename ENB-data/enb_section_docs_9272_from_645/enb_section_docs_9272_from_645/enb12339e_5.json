      "In its conclusions (FCCC/KP/AWG/2007/L.4), the AWG, among other things: notes the basis for the work from previous AWG sessions, party submissions, the technical paper prepared by the Secretariat and the Convention's ultimate objective; notes that mitigation potential is determined by national circumstances, evolves over time and that applicability of factors and indicators varies among parties; acknowledges that understanding mitigation potential is a complex process and notes that further analysis would help the AWG in completing its work; recognizes the need for further progress in conducting its work programme, invites Annex I parties to continue analyzing the mitigation potential of policies, measures and technologies at their disposal and agrees to consider relevant information from external bodies and forums; notes information from IPCC Working Group III's contribution to AR4 indicating that global emissions of greenhouse gases need to peak within the next 10 to 15 years and be reduced to very low levels, well below half of levels in 2000 by 2050, in order to stabilize their concentrations in the atmosphere at the lowest levels assessed by the IPCC to date in its scenarios; recognizes the outcomes of IPCC Working Group II's contribution to AR4 noting that the lower the stabilization level achieved, the lower the consequent damages; recognizes that IPCC Working Group III's contribution to AR4 indicates that to achieve the lowest stabilization level assessed by the IPCC to date, Annex I parties would be required to reduce emissions by 25-40% below 1990 levels by 2020, through means that may be available to Annex I parties to reach emission reduction targets; indicates that these ranges would be significantly higher for Annex I parties if they were a result of analysis assuming that emission reductions were to be undertaken exclusively by Annex I parties; notes that the IPCC ranges do not take into account lifestyle changes that could increase the reduction range; recognizes that these reduction objectives by Annex I parties would make an important contribution to overall global efforts required to meet the ultimate objective of the Convention Article 2; notes concerns of lack of analysis for stabilization scenarios below 450 ppm carbon dioxide equivalent; cites the need for continued work on this issue on an iterative basis; notes the mitigation potential of the flexible mechanisms in the context of sustainable development considerations; acknowledges the importance of considering further information on indicative ranges of emission reductions, including quantified emission limitation or reduction commitments, for further commitments by Annex I parties through their domestic and international efforts; and agrees to consider this issue, including the timing of submission by parties, at the resumed AWG 4; asks parties to make submissions regarding spillover effects on all parties, particularly developing countries, of tools, policies, measures and methodologies available to Annex I parties; and invites parties to submit views by 9 November 2007 on the development of a timetable to guide the completion of the AWG's work."
