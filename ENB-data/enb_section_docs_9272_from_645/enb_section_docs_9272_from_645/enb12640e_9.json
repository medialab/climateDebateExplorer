      "On Monday, delegates arrived in Bonn armed with a new \"Tool\" provided by the Co-Chairs to facilitate discussions.",
      "Many expressed appreciation for the Tool and quickly began to use it.",
      "One delegate noted this was \"a positive sign, because we could\u00a7ve spent the morning in a procedural wrangle.\" However, the Tool was not without tarnish, as several developing country delegates were visibly upset that, as Hurricane Erika left a path of destruction in Dominica, loss and damage was not clearly placed in the Tool as being part of the agreement.",
      "Commenting on the informal bilaterals that had preceded the meeting, a delegate welcomed efforts to win the confidence of parties, but said it was time to actually negotiate rather than \"re-sort the Geneva negotiating text.\" With nine negotiation days left before Paris, it remains to be seen if the Tool will help chisel the features of the 2015 agreement."
