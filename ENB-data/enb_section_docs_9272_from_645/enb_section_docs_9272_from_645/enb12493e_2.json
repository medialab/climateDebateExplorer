      "On carbon capture (CCS) under the CDM, Co-Facilitator Pedro Martins Barata (Portugal) reported that parties had been unable to agree on whether CCS should be eligible under the CDM, but had agreed on a draft COP/MOP decision containing two options on issues that need to be addressed.",
      "He requested that the conclusions be amended to recommend the decision for consideration rather than adoption by the COP/MOP, noting that a draft decision containing options cannot be adopted.",
