      "This question addressed inertia and time-scales associated with changes in the climate system, ecological systems, and socioeconomic sectors and their interactions. On the inertia of the climate system, some participants noted the need to consider greenhouse gases other than CO2, particularly short-lived gases, and the text was amended to reflect this point.",
      "In response to queries from two delegations, Chair Watson confirmed as factual the statement that stabilization of CO2 emissions at near-current levels will never lead to stabilization of CO2 atmospheric concentrations. Concerning inertia in socioeconomic systems, participants debated the costs of changing socioeconomic systems to address climate change, and how such costs vary depending on the necessary speed of response, the availability of technology and the depreciation of capital stock.",
      "Some delegates stated that changes to socioeconomic systems are possible at no net cost, even when responding under pressure, but others disagreed.",
      "Delegates approved a sentence noting that costs of change are higher when socioeconomic systems must respond quickly, but lower when there is time to respond. On the policy implications of inertia, delegates discussed differences in the implications of inertia for mitigation and adaptation, and whether adaptation should be characterized as involving mainly local/regional actions and mitigation as involving coordinated global actions.",
      "Some delegations argued that adaptation can be addressed at a global level, while mitigation also involves local level action.",
      "Chair Watson formed a contact group to seek a compromise solution.",
      "The group reached agreement on a text, later approved by Plenary, which states that inertia has different consequences for adaptation than for mitigation and that adaptation is primarily oriented to address localized impacts of climate change, while mitigation aims to address the impacts on the climate system."
