      "This decision concerns the appropriate working group structure of the IPCC.",
      "Chair Watson noted that there appeared to be consensus to maintain the current three working groups, while recognizing the need to: enhance coordination between the working groups; improve the consideration of overlapping and cross-cutting issues; improve the treatment of economic aspects in Working Groups I and II; and strengthen the treatment of technical aspects in Working Group III. In the ensuing discussion, all delegates expressed support for maintaining the three working groups.",
      "Several participants called for the establishment of a new body to address developing country participation and others suggested that a Bureau member be charged with working on this issue.",
      "One participant called for greater cooperation with scientific bodies of other conventions. Discussion also took place on the degree of oversight that the Plenary should exert over the working groups' plans to address overlapping issues.",
      "Several delegates stated that the Plenary should not 'micromanage' the working groups and guarded against excessive bureaucracy.",
      "Several delegates underscored the importance of not going against the IPCC's agreed principles and procedures. Delegates agreed to endorse the continuation of the current working group structure.",
      "Chair Watson clarified that the plans of the working groups to deal with cross-cutting issues would be considered by the Plenary as part of broader discussions on the working groups' work programmes at a future session."
