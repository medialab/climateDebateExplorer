      "Regarding text describing future unavoidable impacts at low levels of warming, Germany with Belgium, New Zealand, France and Norway, and opposed by the US, India, Saudi Arabia and Australia, supported retaining the text in the Longer Report, as it had been struck from the SYR SPM, and requested the Authors to clarify the robustness of the text.",
      "WGII Co-Chair Martin Parry recommended removing the text.",
      "The US said the text could only appear if associated with a statement acknowledging the link with socioeconomic and climatic inertia and take into account adaptation.",
      "Delegates agreed to remove the text.",
      "The rest of the Longer Report was adopted with minor editorial changes.",
      "Final SYR SPM text: The section in the approved SPM states, inter alia , that: there is high agreement and much evidence that with current mitigation policies, global greenhouse gas emissions will continue to grow over the next few decades; continued emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and very likely induce many changes larger than those observed during the 20th century; for the next few decades, a warming of about 0.2 \u00b0C per decade is projected for a range of Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) emissions scenarios; there is now higher confidence than in the TAR concerning projected patterns of warming and other regional-scale features; regional-scale changes include: disappearance of Arctic late-summer sea ice by the latter part of the 21st century; increase in the frequency of heat waves, and heavy precipitation; increase in tropical cyclone intensity; and annual river runoff and water availability increase at high latitudes and decrease in some dry regions in the mid-latitudes and tropics; some systems, sectors and regions are likely to be especially affected by climate change, including, inter alia , boreal forests, coral reefs, agriculture in low latitudes, the Arctic, Africa and small island states; anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for centuries due to the timescales associated with climate processes and feedbacks, even if greenhouse gas concentrations were to be stabilized; contraction of the Greenland ice sheet is projected to continue to contribute to sea level rise after 2100; climate change is likely to lead to some irreversible impacts.",
      "There is medium confidence that approximately 20-30% of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average warming exceed 1.5-2.5 \u00b0C; and based on current model simulations, the meridional overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean will very likely slow down during the 21st century, but is very unlikely to undergo a large abrupt transition.",
      "The approved SPM also includes a figures on projected greenhouse gas concentrations and surface temperature (Figure SPM 5), one on the geographical pattern of surface warming (Figure SPM 6), one on examples of impacts associated with global average temperature change (Figure SPM 7) and another on estimated multi-century warming relative to 1980-1999 for AR4 stabilization categories (Figure SPM 8).",
      "It also includes tables on examples of some projected regional impacts (Table SPM 2) and one on examples of possible impacts due to changes in extreme weather and climate events (Table SPM 3)."
