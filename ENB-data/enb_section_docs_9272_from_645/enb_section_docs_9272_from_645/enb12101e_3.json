      "SBI continued discussion of non-Annex I communications.",
      "On financial and technical support for non-Annex I communications, AOSIS cautioned against standardizing content requirements for national communications and indicated the benefits of allowing small states to complete national communications on a regional basis.",
      "The EU, noting that the GEF had increased funding for non-Annex I communications, said the financial mechanism had responded effectively to developing country needs.",
      "The G-77/CHINA called for clear guidance on financial and technical support and said the GEF did not provide adequate funding.",
      "BOTSWANA, ZIMBABWE and the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC said national communications should be an ongoing process and noted that practical difficulties faced by non-Annex I Parties impede the necessary continuity. On interaction between FCCC and the GEF, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA observed that the GEF Council Members also represented Parties to the Convention.",
      "URUGUAY expressed satisfaction with the GEF`s assistance.",
      "MEXICO highlighted the need to share experiences at the regional level to build capacities for national communications.",
      "The US emphasized continuity in information sharing and proposed conducting an annual update of inventories contained in initial communications.",
      "Chair Kante suggested continued discussion in a contact group and a meeting between the G-77/CHINA, the GEF and implementing agencies to exchange views on the difficulties encountered in providing financial resources for non-Annex I communications. On arrangements for intergovernmental meetings, Parties exchanged views on COP-5: when it should commence; whether a Committee of the Whole (COW) should be created; what form the High Level Segment should take; and dates for COP-6.",
      "Several Parties, including EGYPT, the EU, JAPAN, POLAND and RUSSIA favored establishing a COW as it would benefit small delegations.",
      "Stating that COP-5 will be largely a technical meeting, SAUDI ARABIA, with KAZAKHSTAN and CHINA, opposed the creation of a COW.",
      "CANADA and SLOVENIA preferred the High Level Segment but without formal oral presentations.",
      "The EU suggested an informal panel discussion between ministers to enable them to focus on important political issues. EGYPT proposed grouping controversial issues into clusters and discussing them in workshops before COP-5.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA cautioned against introducing controversial issues that could 'torpedo' the success of COP-5.",
      "The NETHERLANDS expressed interest in hosting COP-6.",
      "Chair Kante requested the Rapporteur to consult with Parties and find common ground on these issues."
