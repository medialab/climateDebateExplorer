      "This agenda item was first taken up in SBSTA plenary on Monday, 7 May, and addressed in three contact groups and numerous informal meetings (FCCC/SBSTA/2007/MISCs.2 and 3, and ( FCCC/SBSTA/2007/3 ).",
      "Contact groups were co-chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and Hern\u00e1n Carlino (Argentina), with Greg Picker (Australia), Thelma Krug (Brazil), and Peter Graham (Canada) facilitating various drafting group discussions.",
      "In spite of an intensive schedule, parties were unable to reach consensus on the many issues involved and a bracketed draft COP decision was added as an annex to the SBSTA conclusions.",
      "Delegates first worked on the basis of a draft COP decision prepared by SBSTA Chair Kumarsingh, and then on a Co-Chairs' revised draft, undertaking a line-by-line discussion of the text.",
      "The EU, supported by many others, called for a more ambitious COP 13 decision less focused on technical and methodological issues, stressing co-benefits, voluntary participation and a pilot phase.",
      "The US and Japan emphasized ongoing actions.",
      "Japan and others expressed concern with specifying Annex II parties in a paragraph inviting parties to mobilize resources.",
      "However, many developing countries underscored the need for stable and predictable resources and proposed reference to UNFCCC Article 4.3, 4.4, and 4.7 on financial commitments from developed countries.",
      "Many African countries called for including forest degradation, and Papua New Guinea, India and others, opposed by Brazil and others, stressed stabilization and conservation.. Progress was made on several paragraphs and compromise was reached, for example by referring to efforts instead of to activities(w hich some felt was more narrow or prescriptive) and to the need to address forest degradation.",
      "However, parties could not agree on national reference emissions levels, or reference to pilot activities to address drivers of deforestation relevant to national circumstances.",
      "Important differences also remain on the inclusion of forest stabilization and conservation.",
      "By Thursday evening, most of the draft COP decision was bracketed, with consensus only on the need to continue consideration at SBSTA 27.",
      "Turning to SBSTA conclusions, a paragraph was proposed inviting parties to submit their views on the issues under the Convention related to reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action.",
      "India opposed reference to the Convention.",
      "However, the paragraph was agreed as presented with the addition of text clarifying that submissions should address further steps in this process."
