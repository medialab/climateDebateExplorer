      "Chair Thorgeirsson indicated that informal conclusions had been conducted by Richard Bradley (US), who then briefed Parties on these discussions, noting agreement on the value of a balanced information package and a process for recommending a draft decision at SB-17 for COP- 8.",
      "He informed the SBSTA that agreement had been reached the previous night, with the exception of a G-77/CHINA proposal to amend three references in the text to relate specifically to 'Annex I' Parties. Following further informal consultations on this proposal, Richard Bradley reported on a compromise whereby reference to Annex I Parties had been inserted in one paragraph, while another paragraph had been altered to encourage government-stakeholder dialogue to advance information sharing 'regarding replacement options for ozone-depleting substances in a manner that contributes to the objectives of the Montreal Protocol and the UNFCCC.",
      "' In another paragraph, the reference to Parties had been removed so that only 'relevant organizations' were encouraged to make policy-neutral information available.",
      "The SBSTA adopted the draft conclusions, as amended."
