      "With the issue of the second commitment period simmering under the surface, the opening COP and SBI plenaries were full of lengthy discussions on issues likely to dominate the COP agenda over the next two weeks.",
      "As in the past, the inclusion of the second review of adequacy of commitments remains controversial, and the item was held in abeyance for the fifth year running.",
      "The adoption of the agenda in SBI took much longer, with discussions focusing on a Secretariat document that highlights mitigation measures by developing countries.",
      "One delegate observed that the insistence by developing countries to oppose the recognition of the document is ironic as it puts into question one of the reasons the US rejected the Protocol.",
      "Others suggested that the Secretariat`s document could have provided some 'ammunition' to increase financial and technical assistance for developing countries, while reinforcing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and providing an opportunity for the US to come back on board."
