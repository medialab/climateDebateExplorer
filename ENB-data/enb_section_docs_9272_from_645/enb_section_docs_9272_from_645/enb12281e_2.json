      "Praising her 'tireless dedication and enthusiasm,' he said the best tribute delegates could give would be to produce a strong outcome at this meeting. Parties then elected by acclamation St\u00e9phane Dion, Canada`s Environment Minister, as President of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1.",
      "Dion called for steps to 'implement, improve and innovate,' including formally adopting the Marrakesh Accords and improving implementation of the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, including the CDM.",

UNFCCC Acting Executive Secretary Richard Kinley highlighted 2005 as a remarkable year for international climate policy, but drew attention to new data showing an increase in Annex I emissions and the need for further action."
