      "The contact group, chaired by Jos\u00e9 Romero (Switzerland), met throughout the day.",
      "Parties worked through the text on the improved guidelines for non-Annex I national communications, removing several brackets.",
      "The discussion focused on how best to structure individual paragraphs so that they accurately reflect agreed ideas.",
      "In several instances, delegates raised the issue of when to use 'should' rather than 'are encouraged to.",
      "' In the afternoon session, Parties returned to the beginning of the text in an effort to remove remaining brackets.",
      "Parties could not agree on whether the guidelines should refer to specific paragraphs of UNFCCC Articles 4 (commitments) and 12 (communication of information), the Articles in their entirety, or have no reference to specific articles. Views on the use of elements from the guidelines for Annex I national communications varied, and no agreement was reached on inventory years, or whether Parties 'should' or 'shall' use the IPCC Revised 1996 Guidelines for the preparation of inventories.",
      "Delegates again addressed, and failed to agree, whether to have 'develop and use' or just 'use' country-specific and regional emissions factors.",
      "They then discussed, among other options, whether to have 'provide information on' or 'consider identifying' key source categories as described in the IPCC Good Practice Guidance, and failed to agree.",
      "Discussions continued late into the night."
