      "Stressing that the negotiations should be based on parties proposals and submissions, he said the Chair s text should not serve as a basis for negotiation.",
      "Algeria, for the AFRICAN GROUP, underscored the need for adaptation and massively scaled-up and predictable funding.",
      "He stressed that a shared vision should not be focused only on mitigating climate change but also on contending with its impacts.",
      "Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, highlighted the role of major economies and identified the need for a global agreement that is: informed by science; achievable; comprehensive; and able to reflect the full spectrum of mitigation and adaptation options.",
      "Noting that the work of the AWG-KP and the AWG-LCA will form the basis for agreement in Copenhagen, she underscored the need for consistency and coherence between the two groups.",
      "Grenada, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES (AOSIS), and Lesotho, for the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), called for stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations below 350 parts per million (ppm) and limiting temperature increases to below 1.5\u00b0C.",
      "AOSIS emphasized the human dimension of climate change and expressed concern with attempts to conflate adaptation funding with official development assistance.",
      "LDCs underscored the need for adaptation technologies and urged the AWG-LCA to establish concrete mechanisms for their deployment.",
      "He stressed that financing mechanisms should be fully accountable to the UNFCCC.",
      "The Czech Republic, for the EUROPEAN UNION (EU), noted the upcoming meeting of the Group of 20.",
      "He highlighted the need for low carbon development strategies and said developing countries should reduce emissions by 15-30% below business as usual levels by 2020.",
      "He also said a framework for action on adaptation should be a part of the agreement in Copenhagen.",
      "The Republic of Korea, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, highlighted Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) and supported the creation of a NAMA registry.",
      "She also underscored the need for further exchange of information between AWG-LCA and AWG-KP.",
      "INDONESIA stressed development needs and the importance of addressing adaptation and financial and technological support as well as mitigation.",
      "The US highlighted the urgency of addressing climate change, identified the need to be guided by science and pragmatism, and stressed links between sustainable development and the transformation to a low carbon economy.",
      "He recognized the unique position of the US as the largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases and as a country with important capabilities, but underscored that the US alone cannot provide the solution to the climate change problem.",
      "Calling for significant action by major economies, he highlighted measures by the US and China in their economic stimulus packages to promote clean energy.",
      "He underscored President Obama s plans for a federal cap-and-trade system that will set the US pathway to cutting emissions by 15% from current levels by 2020 and 80% by 2050, and highlighted technological leap-frogging by developing countries.",
      "The US also called for a shared vision that is guided by science and contains clear milestones, and identified the need to establish a structure for significant financial support for developing countries, and for an effective use of adaptation resources focusing on the most vulnerable countries. BANGLADESH called for a mechanism for prompt financial support to respond to localized extreme events and highlighted the proposal for an international air travel levy to raise additional funding for adaptation.",
      "The GAMBIA highlighted the urgency of adaptation action and called for a comprehensive approach, including building of financial and technological capacity and institutional support.",
      "ARGENTINA expressed hope for an agreement on long-term global objectives, including medium and long-term commitments, and technological and economic assistance that contributes to the eradication of poverty in developing countries.

      "He highlighted the need for substantial outcomes on adaptation and for new and additional resources. SAUDI ARABIA cautioned against overlooking non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions, and opposed proposals to reduce fossil fuels imports, given impacts to those economies that depend on such commodities.",
      "TURKEY noted that his country is in the process of acceding to the Kyoto Protocol."
