      "The dissemination of IPCC products also tests the Panel`s ability to retain its trademark integrity, through its struggles to convey the findings of the IPCC`s outcome documents without distorting their content.",
      "As a result, there was a strong commitment to developing an outreach strategy and the Outreach Task Group`s discussions were fruitful in identifying priorities for disseminating the special reports on Ozone and Climate Change and on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage, which are due for completion in 2005.",
      "Participants saw this as an opportunity to gather experience and build a long-term communications strategy, which would be in place to ensure that the AR4 reaches the broadest possible audience.",
      "While concerns were expressed regarding the costs of such activities, the long-standing interest in this matter is sure to generate the necessary political will for overcoming these financial constraints. The process of creating an 'international dish' out of the available ingredients proved successful at IPCC-22.",
