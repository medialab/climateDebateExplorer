      "On guidelines for national communications, the IPCC noted its recent work to improve guidelines for national inventory preparation.",
      "AUSTRALIA called for separate development of guidelines for national communications inventory data.",
      "NORWAY said more experience on the use of guidelines was necessary before a final decision is taken.",
      "The EU and JAPAN supported a common reporting format (CRF) proposed for inventory data guidelines.",
      "The US cautioned against overly prescriptive guidelines.",
      "CANADA stressed substance, not timing, as the most important consideration and, with POLAND, said it is impractical for Parties to report on all climate change-related policies and measures.",
      "RUSSIA opposed Canada`s suggestion for an annual system of providing inventories, as it would be costly and difficult. A contact group, co-chaired by Jim Penman (UK) and Mark Mwandosya (Tanzania), was convened to consider this issue further.",
      "The group held nine meetings from 2-11 June, and considered guidelines for inventory and non-inventory reporting, the draft decisions and conclusions on these guidelines, draft conclusions on the review process related to greenhouse gas inventories, and draft conclusions on a work programme on methodological issues related to Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8.",
      "The group negotiated text for all relevant documents for consideration by SBSTA, except in the case of the non-inventory part of the guidelines, where it did not complete its deliberations. On Thursday, 10 June, SBSTA considered the Chair`s draft conclusions and a draft decision for the COP on guidelines for the preparation of national communications (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.5 and Add.1).",
      "Chair Chow informed delegates that discussion on the non-inventory part of the guidelines relating to projections, policies and measures, financial resources and transfer of technology, and other matters, was not concluded in the contact group convened at this session, and will continue at SBSTA-11. In a section of the draft conclusions requesting Parties not using the common reporting format for certain sectoral background data tables on land use, land-use change and forestry to specify alternative formats, CHINA added a specific reference noting that this request included Annex I Parties.",
      "On the proposed title for the non-inventory part of the guidelines, the EU suggested shortening it to read 'UNFCCC reporting guidelines on national reports,' as agreed in the contact group.",
      "ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA said the title should not be amended until consideration of the content had been completed.",
      "Delegates agreed to retain the current title but with a note that it will be subject to further discussion at the next session.",
      "Delegates adopted the draft conclusions, as amended, and the draft decision for the COP.",
      "Chair Chow noted that they will be forwarded to SBI for its consideration. The Chair`s conclusions on guidelines for national communications (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.5), inter alia, noted that SBSTA: advised the SBI to set up a two-year trial period starting in early 2000 to assess FCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, with a view to revising it at COP-7; requested the IPCC to provide its report on work uncertainties and good practices in time for consideration at SBSTA-12; decided to continue discussions on revisions to the non- inventory part of the guidelines at SBSTA-11; and requested the Secretariat to prepare a document reflecting the state of discussions at the close of SBSTA-10. The draft decision, annexed to the conclusions, recommends that the COP, inter alia: adopt the guidelines on inventories; instruct Annex I Parties to use the inventory guidelines for reporting inventories due by 15 April each year, beginning in 2000; invite Parties to submit separately to the Secretariat, by 1 July 2001, information on experiences using the guidelines during 2000-2001, particularly in relation to the CRF; request the Secretariat to prepare a report on the guidelines for consideration at SBSTA-15; and consider revisions to the guidelines at SBSTA-15 for a decision at COP-7.",
      "The guidelines, including the common reporting format (CRF), are contained in an annex to the draft decision."
