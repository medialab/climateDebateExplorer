      "Delegates convened informally to discuss a Chair`s draft COP/MOP decision.",
      "Parties differed on how to use experiences from the CDM under the second track of JI, in particular whether CDM`s designated operational entities (DOEs) may act as accredited independent entities, and whether JI projects can use CDM methodologies and the CDM project design document.",
      "Developing countries insisted that DOEs and CDM methodologies cannot be applied automatically, given the differences between JI and CDM host countries, and between JI and CDM procedures.",
      "However, several developed countries opposed this, calling for a 'quick start JI' in accordance with the Marrakesh Accords.",
      "These countries emphasized that in practice DOEs have already been used in determining JI projects, and noted that some CDM methodologies apply anywhere.",
      "No agreement was reached.",
      "Informal consultations will continue on Monday."
