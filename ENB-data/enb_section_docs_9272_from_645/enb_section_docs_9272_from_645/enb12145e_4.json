      "Delegates continued discussing guidelines under Article 7.1 (inclusion of supplementary information in annual inventories).",
      "The US, opposed by the EU and AUSTRALIA, proposed deleting the section on adjustments in accordance with Article 5.2 (adjustments), maintaining that reporting should be the responsibility of the review team, not the Party.",
      "SAMOA noted the work on the concept of a true-up period in the compliance group, and said the group on Articles 5,7,and 8 should consider technical constraints on its length. On consideration of Article 7.2 (inclusion of supplementary information in national communications), the US, NORWAY, SAUDI ARABIA and GERMANY questioned the timing for the submission of national communications and where this should be treated.",
      "On national registries, the US identified the importance of the discussions on the mechanisms for the work in this group. SAUDI ARABIA suggested that the national communications of Annex I Parties include an evaluation of the extent to which individual CDM projects have assisted non-Annex I Parties to achieve sustainable development.",
      "NORWAY, supported by NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA and the US, said this was not realistic."
