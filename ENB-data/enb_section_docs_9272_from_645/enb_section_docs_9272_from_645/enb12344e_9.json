      "Delegates were heard praising Australia's announcement that the new government intends to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.",
      "The declaration by Australia was greeted with applause in plenary, and some participants saw it as an additional source of momentum alongside several ambitious and detailed proposals for the roadmap from parties.",
      "Several delegates were also warning that a very busy schedule lay ahead - especially during the second week.",
      "While some seemed very optimistic that an agreement on a future negotiating agenda and 2009 deadline for talks would be agreed in Bali, not everyone was so sanguine.",
      "A Bali roadmap would of course be the right outcome, but nothing is guaranteed in this process, said one veteran.",
      "Meanwhile, some delegates were noting the inauspicious start to SBI, with an agenda dispute over adding an item on technology transfer.",
      "While this new item had apparently been agreed by the COP earlier in the day, others were suggesting that it had been agreed largely because some parties were not paying attention in plenary or were confused about the proposal.",
      "Informal consultations on technology transfer continued into the night."
