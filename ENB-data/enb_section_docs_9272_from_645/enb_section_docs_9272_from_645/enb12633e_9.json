      "As they reached the meeting\u00a7s half-way mark, delegates discussed the appropriate vehicle to reach the speed at which negotiations must progress on the remaining road to Paris. At the ADP facilitated discussion on finance, many were heartened by the pace at which paragraphs were deleted, albeit some remarked that substantive discussions still had yet to start, saying it is time to \"switch gears.\" A debate around whether this would entail a restructuring and \"clustering\" exercise within each section, or directly addressing substance, prompted a delegate to note that sometimes gears \"unpleasantly groan\" when shifted.",
      "While discussions on how to proceed took up precious time, most welcomed them as moving onto the right track \"to overhaul the text and get in gear for negotiations.\" While the multilateral assessment session provided an opportunity to look at the road travelled, with countries assessed reporting they had met their Kyoto first commitment period targets, the TEM on energy efficiency seemed to look to the road ahead, highlighting the potential role of cities to be in the mitigation\u00a7s driving seat."
