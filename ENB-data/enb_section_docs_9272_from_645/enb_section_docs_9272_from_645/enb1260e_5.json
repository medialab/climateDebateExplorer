      "Reactions to the US positions were the order of the day in the corridors.",
      "Some 'disappointed' EU delegates agreed with many of the facts underlying the US position, but said these facts were not properly reflected in the proposed targets.",
      "Recalling that the IPCC science calls for early action and indicates the need for significant reductions below 1990 levels, many said the US target, which is even lower than Japan's 'inadequate' target, is a 'long way' from this and intensive dialogue with all Parties was needed. Some developing countries delegates were not surprised by the US position and said the G-77/China proposal was intended to counter-balance it.",
      "One developing country observer noted that the US, in promoting its containment policies, has played several unilateral cards worldwide as of late and speculated that inflexibility in this forum could lead to failure.",
      "Another said that no protocol is better than a protocol with new developing country commitments. Environmental NGOs have begun preparing their strategic response, determined to 'salvage' the AGBM process and ensure that a reported 'celebration' by the business lobby on Wednesday evening was premature.",
      "Given the high-level nature of the US announcement, NGOs will focus their efforts on attempts to convince other Heads of State, such as British Prime Minister Blair and Germany`s Chancellor Kohl to engage the White House.",
      "Japan will also face intense lobbying, as some NGOs have suggested that the host government for COP-3 had paved the way for the US announcement with its own 'extremist' position. The AGBM process is set to continue along parallel negotiating tracks, with 'megaphone diplomacy' punctuating the formal talks in Bonn and beyond.",
      "One NGO speaker underlined his colleagues` determination to pursue the negotiators to the bitter end in December, with the thought that 'it`s not over `til the fat lady sings."
