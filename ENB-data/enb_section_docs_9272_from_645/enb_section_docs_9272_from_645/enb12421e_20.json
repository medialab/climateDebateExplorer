      "This item includes sub-items on proposals for Protocol amendments under Article 3.9 (Annex I further commitments) and on other issues outlined in the AWG-KP s work programme.",
      "The item was first considered during the AWG-KP opening plenary on 1 June, where parties agreed to take up jointly the two sub-items.",
      "Chair Ashe introduced the relevant documents ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/5 , 7 and 8 ; FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/MISC.8 and Add.1 ; FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/MISC.9 and Adds.",
      "1 2 ; FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/MISC.10 ; FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/MISC.11 and Add.",
      "1 ; FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/8 ).",
      "Parties agreed to establish three contact groups on: Annex I parties further emission reductions (paragraphs 49(a) and (b) of the AWG-KP s work programme), co-chaired by Leon Charles (Grenada) and Gertraud Wollansky (Austria); other issues (paragraph 49(c) of the AWG-KP s work programme), chaired by AWG-KP Vice-Chair Harald Dovland (Norway); and legal matters, co-chaired by Sandea De Wet (South Africa) and Gerhard Loibl (Austria).",
      "On the legal matters group, parties agreed that it would only consider issues referred to it by the two other contact groups.",
      "Bolivia urged that the time allocation reflect the importance of emission targets and legal matters.",
      "As requested by AWG-KP 7, AWG-KP Chair Ashe had prepared two documents for the session: a proposal on Protocol amendments pursuant to Article 3.9 ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/7 ); and a text ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/8 ) on issues outlined in the AWG-KP s work programme ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/8 ).",
      "These other issues include: the flexibility mechanisms; LULUCF; greenhouse gases, sectors and source categories; common metrics to calculate CO2 equivalence of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks; and methodological and other issues.",
      "At the meeting, the contact groups worked to include all proposals and streamline the documents, while AWG-KP Chair Ashe held informal consultations on how to move forward with the resulting documents.",
      "According Protocol Articles 20.2 and Article 21.3 , proposed amendments to the Protocol and its annexes must be communicated to parties through the Secretariat six months prior to the meeting where they are proposed for adoption.",
      "The deadline for communicating amendment proposals for adoption by COP/MOP 5 closing plenary is 17 June 2009.",
      "Some parties would have preferred to give the AWG-KP Chair a mandate to prepare text on proposed Protocol amendments based on the two documents, and request the Secretariat to circulate the text in compliance with the six-month rule.",
      "However, parties did not reach consensus on such a request.",
      "Instead, they agreed to state that documentation prepared by the AWG-KP Chair does not constitute text for possible Protocol amendment to be communicated to parties by the Secretariat under Protocol Articles 20.2 and 21.3 .",
      "During the AWG-KP closing plenary, several parties and groups of parties, including Australia, Tuvalu, Colombia, the EU and Brazil, on behalf of 37 developing countries, indicated that they had already submitted or were planning to submit Protocol amendment proposals for communication in accordance with the six-month rule.",
      "Parties also agreed that the AWG-KP Chair is to prepare documentation building upon the work at AWG-KP 8.",
      "It is expected that such documentation will be based on non-papers that were developed at AWG-KP 8 relating to Annex I parties emission reductions and other issues.",
      "Detailed discussions on these issues are summarized below."
