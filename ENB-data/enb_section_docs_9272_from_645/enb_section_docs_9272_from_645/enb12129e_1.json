      "Chair Dovland summarized the outcome of the FCCC workshop on policies and measures (P&Ms) held during April in Copenhagen, and asked delegates for suggestions on future work.",
      "While most delegates underlined the continuing value of information exchange, there was concern at the heavy workload prior to COP-6.",
      "The EU proposed that additional workshops be held to address the technical aspects of P&Ms and emphasized the need to improve quantification of assessment of P&Ms at a sectoral level.",
      "NIGERIA suggested organizing workshops to examine the effect of P&Ms on developing countries, and proposed that P&Ms be addressed as a cross-cutting issue with FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects).",
      "Delegates proposed that work be undertaken through Friends of the Chair rather than a contact group. JAPAN and the US doubted the value of using one set of indicators to evaluate national policies.",
      "CANADA, with AUSTRALIA, called for indicators that take into account specific national circumstances.",
      "He preferred the concept of 'good practices' to 'best practices' and, with the US, highlighted the importance of completing national inventories.",
      "The NETHERLANDS and FRANCE said reliance on inventories alone was insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of P&Ms."
