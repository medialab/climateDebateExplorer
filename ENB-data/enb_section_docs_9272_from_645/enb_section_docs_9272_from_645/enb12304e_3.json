      "On Wednesday morning, the contact group completed its work after making a number of revisions to the Chairs draft text.",
      "This text was agreed following discussions on the work schedule and organization of COP 12, COP/MOP 2 and future meetings, and on the status of observer parties to the Protocol.",
      "On COP 12 and COP/MOP 2, discussions focused on the time that should be set for ending evening sessions.",
      "The UMBRELLA GROUP and the G-77/CHINA preferred setting an earlier time, whereas the EU preferred a more flexible arrangement that would allow for later meetings.",
      "The final formulation recommends that meetings should normally end at 6:00 pm but could extend until 9:00 pm under exceptional circumstances.",
      "On future sessions, the EU objected to text proposed by the US recommending that meetings be held during normal United Nations Headquarters working hours (which are 10:00 am to 6:00 pm, with a two hour break for lunch).",
      "The US also proposed a recommendation that sessions of the subsidiary bodies and workshops be scheduled so as to minimize weekend travel wherever possible.",
      "This was opposed by the EU and some developing countries, while AUSTRALIA, NORWAY and JAPAN favored its inclusion.",
      "The final compromise resulted in deletion of the text on weekend travel, and amendment of the sentence on UN hours, so that the SBI encouraged(r ather than recommended ) that Convention and Protocol meetings should be held during UN Headquarters ` hours whenever possible.",
      "Regarding the status of UNFCCC parties at Protocol informal consultations, delegates were unable to agree on a precise legal position on their status, with views expressed by the EU on one side and AUSTRALIA and the US on the other.",
      "Parties agreed not to refer specifically to this issue in the text, noting orally that informal talks under the Protocol should be guided by the concept of inclusiveness, with one party suggesting that the issue could be revisited if problems arise.",
      "Delegates also discussed text reviewing the arrangement/organization of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1, including whether these events should serve as a framework for future sessions.",
      "The US pointed out that such arrangements should be reviewed periodically, and delegates agreed that COP/MOP 1 and COP 11 should serve as the framework for COP/MOP 2 and COP 12, but that later sessions should not be referenced. CAPACITY BUILDING (CONVENTION): The contact group considered the Co-Chairs ` proposal for SBI conclusions on monitoring capacity-building activities.",
      "Many delegates noted that while they were close to agreeing on a compilation and synthesis report on capacity-building activities, other issues required more negotiation.",
      "Parties then discussed whether and when to organize an in-session workshop, disagreeing on South Africa's proposal that countries that are not able to participate in the workshop could make submissions to it.",
      "With delegates unable to reach an agreement during their last scheduled contact group meeting at SBI 24, they agreed to continue informal consultations on Wednesday evening.",
      "However, further talks did not prove successful, and delegates agreed to forward the issue to the SBI Chair, recommending that it be sent to SBI 25 for consideration. CAPACITY BUILDING (PROTOCOL): With no agreement reached during informal consultations on Wednesday afternoon and evening, delegates agreed to forward the issue to the SBI Chair, recommending that it be sent to SBI 25 for consideration."
