      "Recalling a request from IPCC-29 to revise the rules of procedure, Secretary Christ introduced a list of possible changes to the rules, which were prepared in collaboration with the WMO Legal Counsel ( IPCC-XXX/Doc.2 ).",
      "She noted corrections in regard to several topics, including the calculation of applicable majority and ensuring regional representation.",
      "Chair Pachauri proposed, and delegates agreed, to set up a Task Group on the rules of procedure, co-chaired by the US and Mauritius, to report back to the Panel at the next session.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium suggested developing guidance on how to organize the work of regional groups during the elections.",
      "Brazil proposed submissions from governments on changes to the rules of procedure.",
      "Chair Pachauri further noted that as a result of increasing the number of WG III Co-Chairs and decreasing the number of WG III Vice-Chairs, the region of Asia did not receive a seat in the WG III Bureau.",
      "In this regard, Saudi Arabia proposed to increase the size of the Bureau by one to accommodate its candidate.",
      "China, Sudan, Egypt, Iran, the Russian Federation and others supported the proposal.",
      "The US, the UK and others stressed this should not set a precedent for the future.",
      "Australia and New Zealand noted a lack of a representative from the South-West Pacific region on the WG III Bureau, and suggested this, too, should be addressed if the proposal from Saudi Arabia is accepted.",
      "Chair Pachauri proposed allowing the Saudi Arabian candidate, Taha Zatari, to become WG III Vice-Chair, emphasizing this as a one-time exception.",
      "Delegates approved the suggestion by Chair Pachauri, leaving open the possibility that an additional representative from the South-West Pacific region could be added to the Bureau at a later date."
