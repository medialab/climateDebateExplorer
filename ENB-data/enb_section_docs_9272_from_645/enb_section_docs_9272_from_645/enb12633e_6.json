      "Brian Dean, International Energy Agency, stressed opportunities for decoupling economic growth from energy intensity. Vladimir Kendrovski, World Health Organization, outlined the health benefits of energy efficiency in urban environments, emphasizing the importance of considering the health gains associated with addressing the causes of climate change. John Christensen, UN Environment Programme, presented on energy challenges for cities, as well responses and opportunities. Delphine Garin, World Business Council for Sustainable Development, discussed cities\u00a7 solutions for energy efficiency in a rapidly urbanizing and climate-resilient world, introducing nine cities\u00a7 action plans to address technical barriers. During the ensuing discussion, parties debated: ways to facilitate knowledge sharing on best practices; the role of the Convention bodies in supporting energy efficiency in urban environments; and how to build on previous TEMs."
