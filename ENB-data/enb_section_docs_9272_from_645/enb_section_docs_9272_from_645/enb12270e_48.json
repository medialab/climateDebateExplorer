      "Implementation of paragraph 7(c) of the UNFCCC`s Financial Procedures (financial support for participation) was first addressed by SBI in plenary on Friday, 20 May.",
      "The Secretariat noted that, at the request of SB 19, it had suspended its practice of withdrawing funding to Parties to participate in the UNFCCC process if they had outstanding contributions to the core budget.",
      "Argentina noted that this incentive only affects developing countries because only they request financial help to attend meetings.",
      "A shortage of contributions means that only half the support needed for delegates might be available for COP 11 and COP/MOP 1.",
      "SBI Chair Becker said he would consult informally with Parties and prepare draft conclusions.",
      "In the plenary meeting on Thursday, 26 May, SBI adopted conclusions on this sub-item following minor textual amendments proposed by Australia."
