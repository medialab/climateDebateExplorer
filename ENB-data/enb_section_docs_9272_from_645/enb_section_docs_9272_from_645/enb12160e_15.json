      "President Pronk opened the meeting, and suggested organizing the work according to the following four 'boxes' that cluster issues based on previous discussions: (i) capacity building, technology transfer, adverse effects, and guidance to the GEF; (ii) mechanisms; (iii) LULUCF; and (iv) P&Ms, compliance and accounting, and reporting and review under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8. He said he would chair the informal high-level plenary sessions, and that after hearing statements on the issues in each 'box' a smaller informal group would be formed, chaired by ministers.",
      "Discussions in the informal Plenary would then proceed to the next 'box.",
      "' The informal groups would report back to the informal Plenary when their discussions had been completed."
