      "Delegates discussed the provisional agenda (FCCC/SBI/2005/1 and Add.1) in detail, particularly additions proposed by SAUDI ARABIA on implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (FCCC/SBI/2005/1/Add.2), and the G-77/CHINA`s proposed agenda item on capacity building. The EU, CENTRAL GROUP and ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP supported the agenda without amendments, while the AFRICA GROUP and AOSIS supported adding an item on capacity building.",
      "The UMBRELLA GROUP opposed Saudi Arabia`s proposal and sought more information on the capacity building proposal.",
