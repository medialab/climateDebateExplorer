      "Late on Tuesday afternoon, Co-Facilitator Bamsey invited delegates to provide guidance on the organization of work of subsequent workshops.",
      "Most delegates noted the need for focused discussions. The US suggested devoting half a day to each of the four items, with a presentation leading each item.",
      "He said the co-facilitators could prepare questions that capture the current discussion and circulate them among parties well in advance of the next Dialogue. Switzerland said the second workshop should concentrate on technical or practical activities.",
      "He suggested that the co- facilitators should provide a document by the end of August 2006. South Africa suggested that the second workshop could consider technology transfer and market opportunities, while the third could consider sustainable development and adaptation, and the fourth might take up cross-cutting issues such as funding.",
      "She said a further workshop on positive incentives could be useful, and said consideration should be given to what the outcome(s) of these workshops should be. Norway noted that this workshop had been much more constructive than he had expected, without the 'shaming and blaming' he had been concerned about.",
      "He expressed confidence that the co- facilitators, in consultation with the UNFCCC Secretariat, could select key issues and invite appropriate speakers for the subsequent workshops.",
      "He requested that each future workshop focus on just a few key questions. Brazil stressed that the workshops should be consistent with the original COP 11 decision.",
      "The EU said this workshop had helped parties understand one another better.",
      "She noted parties` comments on the need for subsequent workshops to cover just one or two key topics.",
      "She also suggested a focus on cooperative actions and said a set of helpful questions could be developed. Hungary noted the constructive dialogue and urged discussions on barriers and opportunities to enhance UNFCCC implementation.",
      "He urged strict time limits on speakers so the dialogue flows and is interactive. Canada said the workshops should build on work already carried out under the UNFCCC and draw on relevant processes outside the UNFCCC.",
      "China said the second workshop should focus on parties` actions taken to implement the Convention, actions that should have been taken, and steps to overcome obstacles to implementation.",
      "Noting that many bilateral technology-transfer activities are not conducted through the UNFCCC, Japan said future discussions should consider broader issues in examining implementation. Saudi Arabia said the dialogue should focus exclusively on enhancing implementation and on the four areas described in the relevant COP 11 decision.",
      "The Philippines said lessons learned so far should be consolidated and there should be a review of how all countries have implemented their commitments to date. Co-Facilitator Bamsey said he and his colleague would present proposals on how to organize the next Dialogue by the end of August, and welcomed additional written contributions by the end of May.",
      "Thanking participants for their presentations, ideas and input, he closed the meeting at 6:13 pm."
