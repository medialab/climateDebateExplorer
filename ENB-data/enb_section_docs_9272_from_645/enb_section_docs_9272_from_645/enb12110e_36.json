      "While some Parties hoped for more submissions of non-Annex I communications in time for the first synthesis report, non-Annex I Parties were of the view that submission of their national communications is subject to the availability of financial resources and technical support.",
      "Thus, timing for non-Annex I communications and advancing towards second guidelines were some of the points of contention.",
      "Proposals for technical assessments of these communications to identify information gaps were perceived by some developing countries as attempts to prepare the grounds for new developing country commitments.",
      "Proof of diverging views on the future of non-Annex I communications within the Convention, was the inability to agree on a contingency budget for matters related to the consideration of non-Annex I communications."
