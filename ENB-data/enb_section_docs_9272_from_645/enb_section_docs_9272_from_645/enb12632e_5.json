      "As a sunny Thursday dawned on the World Conference Center Bonn, many expressed cautious optimism about agreement to move \"from the easier towards the more difficult\" during the morning ADP stocktaking.",

Commenting on the reduction by only 5% of the text after three days of arduous work, one seasoned delegate felt the \"mood was right, but the pace too slow.\" While recognizing that the Geneva text \"needs to be handled with care,\" many delegates could not help but nervously consider the dwindling number of negotiating days as they emerged into the balmy summer evening."
