      "In the morning informal group on various approaches, including opportunities for using markets, to enhance the cost effectiveness of, and to promote, mitigation actions, proposals were presented by: Jamaica, for AOSIS; Bolivia; Ecuador; the EU; and Switzerland.",
      "Parties then exchanged views on the way forward. COLOMBIA, with the EU and CHILE, opposed by VENEZUELA and BOLIVIA, proposed dividing time equally between the consideration of non-market mechanisms and new market-based mechanisms.",
      "VENEZUELA emphasized that the group did not have a mandate to discuss new market-based mechanisms.",
      "The EU and others noted that new market mechanisms were one of the approaches and therefore could not be precluded from the discussion.",
      "After clarifying the group s mandate in the afternoon, parties agreed to establish an open-ended drafting group to start discussing draft text headings, with the intention of later flagging relevant text under these headings."
