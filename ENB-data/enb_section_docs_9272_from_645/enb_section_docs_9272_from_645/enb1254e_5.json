      "Wednesday`s observer briefing ended with the AGBM Chair`s comments that the trend of discussion at the extended Bureau meeting was to apply only the FCCC`s objective to a Protocol.",
      "Within minutes of the announcement, reports of counter trends emerged from some of the interested players who had participated in the Bureau meeting.",
      "Some said that a decision to limit the Protocol`s objective to that set out in the FCCC could have implications for those proposals from regional groups and other Parties that stipulate or propose the development of formulae for setting a ceiling on GHG emissions based, for example, on sea level and temperature rises.",
      "Chair Estrada has, reportedly, argued that the introduction of a new objective may cause confusion.",
      "A number of the interested Parties suggested that the matter had not been resolved, and proposals containing new objectives would stay on the table at the AGBM.",
      "One regional representative said 'we have not given up.",
      "' They marked Estrada`s announcement down to 'forceful chairmanship' and suggested that he was somewhat ahead of the Parties in his reading of Tuesday`s meeting.",
      "Some also conceded that, in principle, it would be advisable to restrict the introduction of new objectives but arguments would be made for an exception nonetheless.",
      "Others said that using the same FCCC overall objective would still leave room to incorporate proposed new objectives, perhaps within the section on emissions limitations and reduction objectives.",
      "An interested Party has reportedly been tasked to conduct consultations in an effort to merge the new proposals."
