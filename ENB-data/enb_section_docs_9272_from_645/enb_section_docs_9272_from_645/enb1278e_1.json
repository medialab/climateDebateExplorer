      "Chair Bakary Kante (Senegal) opened the first meeting of the SBI.",
      "Michael Zammit Cutajar, FCCC Executive Secretary, noted 37 countries have signed the Kyoto Protocol, including Parties representing 39% of Annex I CO2 emissions. The G-77/CHINA called on delegates not to be distracted from the COP`s principal task of implementing the Convention.",
      "He recalled a Convention article on a second review of Annex I Party commitments by December 1998.",
      "He also stressed decisions on new and additional financial resources and inadequate implementation of previous COP decisions on technology transfer. On adoption of the agenda, SAUDI ARABIA proposed including 'preparatory work under the related provisions of Articles 2.3 and 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol' in an item on technology transfer.",
      "He said a decision at COP-3 on these paragraphs, on adverse impacts, was taken as part of a compromise package.",
      "The US expressed concern that the amendment could be prejudicial to the Protocol`s wording, because paragraph 2.3 states that the COP serving as the Meeting of the Parties (MOP) 'may take further action' and does not 'require' further action to promote implementation of the paragraph`s provisions.",
      "Delegates agreed to amend the agenda item, adding a bracketed reference to decision 3/CP.3 (adverse impacts) and Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14. The Chair announced Iran`s nomination as SBI Vice Chair for Asia.",
      "He urged joint SBI-SBSTA draft decisions on work allocation and preparations for a work program for the Conference of the Parties/Meeting of the Parties (COP/MOP-1). On national communications, delegates discussed three scheduling options for future Annex I Party communications and their review.",
      "Many Annex I Parties favored: lengthening the period between submissions of national communications; interim electronic reports; and synchronized reporting.",
      "Many favored 2001 for the next communication, but SWITZERLAND said information on achievement of stabilization by 2000 could not be provided until 2002.",
      "The US called for less emphasis on details of domestic actions or national circumstances and for more time for data collection on emissions trading and CDM projects.",
      "The EU, with NEW ZEALAND, favored a fourth national communication deadline of 2005 and a strengthened reporting process leading to the period 2008-2012.",
      "CHINA, with the US, noted COP decisions urging Annex II Parties to include measures taken for technology transfer.",
      "The CHAIR invited Parties to submit nominations for a roster of experts for the in-depth review of Annex I Parties` second national communications."
