      "The final decision on procedures addressed the following: - On the selection of participants to scoping meetings , including a mandate for such meetings, the Panel decides that each Assessment Report, Special Report, Methodology Report and SYR should be preceded by a scoping meeting that develops a draft outline, and clarifies the procedures regarding the purpose of scoping meeting and criteria for selecting its participants. - On the selection of CLAs and lead authors , the Panel decides that the composition of a group of CLAs and lead authors shall aim to reflect, in addition to what is already in the rules of procedures: a range of scientific, technical and socioeconomic views and expertise; a mixture of experts with and without previous experience in the IPCC; and gender balance.",
      "The Panel also decides that: the WG Bureau/TFB will report to the Panel on the selection process and the extent to which the aims were achieved; and every effort should be made to engage experts from the specific region being addressed, as well as experts from outside the region when they can provide an essential contribution to the assessment. - On sources of data and literature , the Panel replaces the annex on Procedure for using non-published/non-peer reviewed sources in IPCC reports with a new annex entitled Procedure on the use of literature in IPCC reports.",
      "The revised procedures place emphasis on the quality of all cited literature, with priority given to peer-reviewed scientific, technical and socioeconomic literature, if available, and detail additional responsibilities for authors, review editors, WG/TFI Co-Chairs, and the IPCC Secretariat in this regard. - On handling the full range of views , the Panel notes that authors and experts should make every effort to take into account, or represent, the full range of views available in scientific literature, even if these views are contradictory.",
      "The decision also introduces a new sub-section entitled Handling the diversity of views under the Assessment Reports, SYR, Special Report and Methodology Reports section, stating, inter alia , that chapter teams are required to consider the range of scientific, technical and socioeconomic views, expressed in balanced assessments.",
      "References on the need to consider the range of scientific, technical, and socioeconomic views are introduced throughout the procedures text. - On the report review , the Panel, inter alia , decides to develop additional guidance on the role of review editors to ensure that reviewers comments are adequately considered, in time for implementation in the AR5 assessment process. - On further assuring the quality of the review , the Panel decides that WG/TFI Co-Chairs should arrange a comprehensive review of reports at each review phase to ensure complete content coverage, and to have cross-cutting parts be cross-checked through relevant authors and Co-Chairs of other WGs. - On confidentiality of draft reports , the Panel decides that drafts of IPCC reports and Technical Papers submitted for formal expert and/or government review, expert and government review comments, and author responses to those comments, will be made publicly available upon finalization.",
      "The Panel considers its draft reports, prior to acceptance, to be pre-decisional, provided in confidence to reviewers, and not for public distribution, quotation or citation. - On the SPM , the Panel clarifies current practices related to providing written comments prior to the SPM plenary approval session, and decides that CLAs should be consulted to ensure that the SPM is fully consistent with findings in the main report. - On the procedure for handling potential errors the Panel adopts the proposed Protocol for Addressing Possible Errors in Previous Assessment Reports with minor amendments. - On evaluation of evidence and treatment of uncertainty , the Panel endorsed the common approach to the treatment of uncertainties as described in the Guidance Paper on Uncertainties, for application to Assessment Reports, Special Reports, SYR, and Technical Papers. - On IPCC guidance material , the Panel decides to further consider the procedure for developing, revising and classifying guidance materials.",
      "The Panel also decides to extend the mandate of the Task Group on Procedures to address, inter alia : relevant inconsistencies in current procedures; selection of participants to IPCC workshops and expert meetings; matters related to transparency, quality and efficiency of the review process; anonymous expert review; and SPM approval sessions."
