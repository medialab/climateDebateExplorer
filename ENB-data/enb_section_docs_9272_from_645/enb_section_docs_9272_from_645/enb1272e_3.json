      "During and after the marathon of reactions in Plenary Friday, delegates and observers pondered possible strategic implications of the New Zealand proposal on new developing country commitments.",
      "Some felt the proposal needed to be aired, sooner rather than later.",
      "Others saw the proposal as disruptive, provoking tension and resistance avoidable at this delicate stage.",
      "Still others wondered whether the proposal might have been placed to cast discussion of voluntary non-Annex I commitments in a comparatively favorable light.",
      "An authoritative observer suggested that the presentation's greatest problem might have been in contradicting its own sequential premise: that a clear picture of Annex I QELROs must emerge before a sober consideration of developing country commitments."
