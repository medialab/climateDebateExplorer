      "COP 18/CMP 8 got underway on Monday morning the first time a COP has been held in the Middle East.",
      "The conference, which is being convened in a brand-new conference center is also deploying a paper-smart format.",
      "Thus, the Doha conference involves fewer documents to keep track of, and, as one proponent of the new format put it, lighter loads might even make it easier to navigate a venue that seems as vast as a desert.",
      "After quickly adopting the agendas under the various bodies, delegates weighed in with numerous lengthy opening statements, which took up most of the plenary sessions.",
      "Many reported serious cases of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu while others chalked it up to a normal first day with the usual all-encompassing opening remarks, which appeared to sap the limited energy reserves of some jet-lagged delegates.",
      "While one delegate commented that the meeting seemed to kick off relatively slowly, another seasoned negotiator pointed out that it will get busier and before long we will have a hard time keeping track of what is happening, where and when."
