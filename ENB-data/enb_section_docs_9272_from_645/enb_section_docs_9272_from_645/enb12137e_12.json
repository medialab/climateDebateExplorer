      "Delegates considered cooperation with relevant scientific organizations, UN Bodies and international conventions on Tuesday, 13 June.",
      "Reports were presented by the IPCC, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), the FCCC Secretariat, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). IPCC Chair Robert Watson noted that the IPPC had completed work on three special reports: Methodological and Technological Issues in Technology Transfer; Emissions Scenarios; and Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry, as well as a report on Good Practice and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.",
      "He said that the preparation and peer-review of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) is well advanced, with the three Working Group reports of the TAR expected to be approved in January 2001.",
      "He urged governments to: support expert participation in the IPCC process; continue to financially support the IPCC trust fund; and avoid using the IPCC process as a pre-negotiating forum for the FCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.",
      "On the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, he highlighted that model calculations indicate that the emission scenarios would result in projected increases in global mean surface temperature of about 1-5 degrees Centigrade by 2001, in contrast to those reported in the IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1-3.5 degrees Centigrade. GCOS Director Alan Thomas outlined developments regarding the facilitation of an intergovernmental process for systematic climate observations; reported on GCOS plans for regional workshops on capacity building; and highlighted developments in the global observing systems for climate, including recent activities of the Integrated Observing System Strategy partnership. Nick Davidson, Deputy Secretary-General of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, identified themes of common interest with the FCCC and noted that the Scientific and Technical Review Panel of the Ramsar Convention is preparing a review of these themes.",
      "Carlos Corvalan (WHO) and Thomas Johannson (UNDP) identified recent relevant climate change initiatives being undertaken by their respective organizations. In discussions on the presentations: Nigeria highlighted the need for open, thorough and transparent scientific processes; Switzerland invited governments to contribute to funding the IPCC; Australia, Canada and others underlined the capacity-building implications of the GCOS regional workshops; and several delegations underlined the importance of maintaining the political independence of the IPCC. On Friday, 16 June, SBSTA adopted conclusions on cooperation with relevant international organizations (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/CRP.5).",
      "In its conclusions, SBSTA, inter alia: notes the progress made in the preparation of the TAR; urges Parties to continue their financial support of the IPCC and ensure the scientific integrity of the IPCC process; notes the efforts being taken by the GCOS Secretariat to organize regional workshops to identify priority capacity-building needs; invites the CGOS Secretariat to report periodically on its activities; and requests the FCCC Secretariat to continue to explore areas of cooperation on substantive matters with UN agencies and other conventions."
