      "Parties agreed to consolidate paragraph 132.5 on developing countries assessing their technology needs with support of developed countries. During discussion on placement of text, many agreed paragraph 132.6 on global collaboration would be better placed in the agreement than in a decision.",
      "TUVALU, with INDIA, opposed by AUSTRALIA, supported anchoring existing institutions in the agreement. South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, proposed text to replace a placeholder for paragraph 131 on a framework for scaling up technology development and transfer. The US and INDIA supported holding a conversation on text on intellectual property rights and a long-term technology goal. On paragraph 129 on a long-term technology goal, CHINA explained it would help motivate and develop a technology \"circulation process.\" NEW ZEALAND opposed the long-term goal, saying that technology is better understood as an enabler to achieve the Convention\u00a7s objective.",
      "The US asked for clarification on language on suggested regular assessments of ready-to-transfer technologies.",
      "Parties agreed to continue discussions on the issues raised."
