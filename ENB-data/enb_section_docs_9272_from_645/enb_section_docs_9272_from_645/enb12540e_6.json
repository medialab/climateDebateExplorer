      "Friday night brought the ADP to the fore once again, and the corridors were filled with both excitement and discontent over the opening plenary of the new body.",
      "This was quite something, commented one delegate exiting the plenary tent.",
      "I have never seen anything like this, declared another.",
      "As the ADP plenary convened just before 6 pm, intense moments followed.",
      "Points of orders were the flavor of the night as the session progressed.",
      "However, delegates reaction to the first point of order by China was unexpected and raised a few laughs, as half the room stood up and rushed to the door as soon as the delegate started speaking.",
      "Luckily, it had nothing to do with his intervention, but rather the need for headsets and translation to understand the point of order made in Chinese.",
      "The mood quickly turned serious again.",
      "After legal advice from the Secretariat that COP Bureau members do not represent parties or regional interests, COP Vice-President Van Lierop s passionate assurances that he was acting in the interest of all parties when presiding over the ADP was met by thundering applause.",
      "Because of the unresolved issue of the ADP Bureau members, the prospect of the ballot box was mooted in plenary just in case the controversy over the Chair of the ADP was not finally resolved through less radical means.",
      "Exiting the plenary, one relieved delegate sighed, That was a lucky escape, I thought I was going to have to cast my vote tonight."
