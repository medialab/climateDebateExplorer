      "Delegates agreed on a number of paragraphs.",
      "They invited the Chair to settle the terminology of projections 'without measures,' since these were unusual terms compared to 'business as usual,' and misleading, as they seemed to exclude consideration of P&Ms implemented prior to the starting point of the projection.",
