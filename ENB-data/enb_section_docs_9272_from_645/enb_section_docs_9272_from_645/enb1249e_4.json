      "While speakers in SBI were supporting NGO participation in the FCCC, delegates and observers in the corridors were considering the prospect of NGO access during AGBM being limited to participation in Plenary sessions and daily briefings.",
      "Most of the negotiations are planned to take place in four closed informal groups.",
      "Some noted that exclusion of NGOs is a necessary response to the pressure on the AGBM to deliver results and that the decision may be designed to accelerate substantive negotiations.",
      "Some NGO representatives stated that this arrangement hinders the Convention because, given more access to negotiations, NGOs are able to apply positive pressure.",
      "Other NGO representatives noted that this is an unwelcome precedent and now puts the onus on governments to inform NGOs of their decisions."
