      "Intra-group dynamics and their impact on negotiations are also being discussed.",
      "Reflecting on the diverse positions within the G-77, one of the group`s delegates noted that in the long run, the regional sub- groups would have to find ways of articulating their specific interests separately.",
      "A split in G-77 is not imminent since the group represents other interests beyond the climate forum.",
      "However, more articulated and clearer regional positions may become apparent at the next COP and probably would be the most feasible way to achieve progress. European negotiators and observers were preoccupied with imminent internal negotiations on burden sharing within the 'bubble' arrangement.",
      "A small number of countries are expected to take on the lion`s share of the burden, creating a very wide gap between the high achievers and the rest.",
      "NGOs have speculated that the lack of balance in the burden sharing deal could impact on the Union`s positions on flexibility and policies and measures.",
      "For example, one NGO suggested that an uneven spread of commitments could undermine the incentive within the less ambitious European countries to accept the kind of common policies and measures required by more ambitious countries."
