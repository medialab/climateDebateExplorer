      "In the morning contact group, parties considered the organization of COP 18 and CMP 8, future sessional periods and participation of observers (FCCC/SBI/2012/11).",
      "The G-77/CHINA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION highlighted the need for additional negotiating time between Bonn and Doha while acknowledging financial constraints.",
      "The US, supported by CANADA and AUSTRALIA, proposed organizing workshops instead of a negotiating session.",
      "INDIA and SOUTH AFRICA said workshops could be integrated into the negotiating process.",
      "The Secretariat confirmed that the deadline for raising funds for the proposed intersessional meeting in Bangkok is Friday next week. SBI Chair Chruszczow encouraged Eastern European states to present an offer to host COP 19 and CMP 9 as soon as possible.",
      "The Chair will prepare text for draft conclusions and negotiations will continue. LULUCF (SBSTA): In the afternoon contact group, Co-Chair Peter Iversen (Denmark) underscored that Decision 2/CMP.7 (LULUCF) requires the SBSTA to address: more comprehensive accounting; possible additional LULUCF activities under the CDM; alternative approaches to addressing the risk of non-permanence under the CDM; and modalities and procedures for applying the concept of additionality.",
      "Parties agreed to prioritize work and submit text, including on the first three areas of work with a focus on technical aspects and experiences. BRAZIL drew attention to non-permanence under the CDM, in particular to issues such as liability for reversibility, consideration of buffers and insurance and its implications.",
      "BELARUS elaborated on time necessary to consider that permanence is achieved.",
      "The EU suggested parties also consider how the issue of addressing non-permanence would work, inter alia, between different commitment periods.",
      "The Co-Chairs will prepare draft conclusions. PROTOTYPE OF THE REGISTRY (SBI): The contact group considering the prototype of the NAMA Registry met in the afternoon, co-chaired by Elina Bardram (EU) and Wondwossen Sintayehu (Ethiopia).",
      "The Secretariat briefed parties on functions of the NAMA Registry.",
      "The EU, supported by KENYA, noted the value of the Registry in matching projects with funding sources, indicating that it should not substitute other MRV requirements. BRAZIL, supported by CHILE, SINGAPORE, CANADA, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA and SOUTH AFRICA, said access rights to the Registry should be reserved for the national UNFCCC focal points.",
      "JAPAN cautioned against overburdening the prototype as it could complicate the technical capacity of the Registry.",
      "Mali, for the AFRICAN GROUP, supported by the US, the PHILIPPINES and ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA, requested a manual on the Registry for distribution to other NAMA stakeholders in their home countries.",
      "The Co-Chairs will compile draft conclusions to be discussed during informal consultations on Monday. ANNEX I FURTHER EMISSION REDUCTIONS (AWG-KP): During the meeting of the AWG-KP spin-off group in the morning and afternoon, Annex I parties made presentations on their submissions on QELROs (FCCC/KP/AWG/2012/MISC.1 and Add.1). SWITZERLAND explained his country s pledge to reduce emissions by at least 20% between the years 2013-2020 compared to 1990 levels and the possibility of increasing the target to 30% if other developed countries commit to comparable emissions reductions and economically more advanced developing countries contribute adequately according to their differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. NORWAY elaborated on his country s emission reduction target of 30% by 2020, which could be increased to 40% as part of a global and comprehensive agreement beyond 2012 where major emitting parties agree on emission reductions in line with the 2\u00b0C target.",
      "The EU discussed their 20% emission reduction target from 1990 levels by 2020, and reiterated willingness to undertake a 30% reduction target as part of a global and comprehensive agreement, provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable reductions and developing countries contribute adequately according to their differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. NEW ZEALAND explained his country s pledge to reduce emissions by 10-20% below 1990 levels provided that: the global agreement limits temperature rise to 2\u00b0C; developed countries make comparable efforts; advanced and major-emitting developing countries take action commensurate with their capabilities; there is an effective set of rules for LULUCF; and there is recourse to international carbon market. LICHTENSTEIN presented a reduction of at least 20% between 2013 and 2020 compared to 1990 levels, saying the level of ambition could rise to 30% if other developed countries make comparable commitments and economically more advanced developing countries also take appropriate mitigation action. KAZAKHSTAN pledged a 15% reduction by 2020 and requested that the base year for her country be updated from 1992 to 1990.",
      "ICELAND pledged a 30% reduction in a joint effort with the EU, and emphasized its participation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.",
      "During discussions delegates addressed, inter alia : the formula for defining QELROs for the 2013-2020 period; use of LULUCF; ways to raise the level of ambition; conditions to move to the top range of the pledges; implications for the Protocol s environmental integrity; ways to calculate the carryover of AAUs; implications of using offsets from market-mechanisms; and existing domestic legislation.",
      "Negotiations will continue."
