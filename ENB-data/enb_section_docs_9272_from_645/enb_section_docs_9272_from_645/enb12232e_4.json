      "Throughout the day on Tuesday, 27 April, participants considered reporting on measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change.",
      "In the morning, presentations addressed adaptation measures, methodologies, policy frameworks, guidelines, tools, and programmes of action.",
      "In the afternoon, participants heard presentations and participated in a panel discussion on the UNDP Adaptation Policy Framework (APF). Graham Sem, UNFCCC Secretariat, presented on information to be provided on vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) in national communications, as defined in the revised UNFCCC Guidelines on non-Annex I national communications.",
      "This should include information on, inter alia, the adverse affects of climate change, critically vulnerable areas, the adaptation measures required, and national and regional programmes to facilitate adaptation.",
      "Sem pointed out that, in addition to internationally-agreed guidelines such as the IPCC technical guidelines for assessing climate change impacts and adaptation, Parties are free to use methodologies developed nationally or regionally, provided they are consistent, transparent, and well documented.",
      "He observed that the UNFCCC Guidelines call for an evaluation of identified adaptation strategies and measures. Isabelle Niang Diop, University of Dakar, Senegal, spoke about the methodologies and frameworks developed to undertake V&A assessments.",
      "She outlined the 'first generation' of methodologies and frameworks, including the 1994 IPCC Technical Guidelines, as well as subsequent methodologies derived from these.",
      "She also drew attention to an alternative approach, known as the 'vulnerability- resilience approach' - that was applied by some small island developing States, and reflected a greater focus on traditional knowledge.",
      "Niang Diop then elaborated on the 'second generation' of methodologies developed in recent years, including the UNDP APF, the LDC national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs), and the UK Climate Impacts Programme.",
      "She explained that these newer methodologies were less prescriptive, placed adaptation within a broader development context, included a greater focus on stakeholder participation, and took into account current conditions, as well as future vulnerability. Xianfu Lu, Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, UK, discussed the modeling of climate change impacts and response measures.",
      "She described V&A impact assessment as one component of an integrated climate change framework.",
      "She explained that state- of-the art modeling involves process-based biophysical impact methods, transient climate change and sea-level rise scenarios, refined socioeconomic baselines, and high resolution data.",
      "However, she stressed that gaps remain in modeling approaches, including a mismatch between global and local impact assessment models, inadequate data (including climate data), insufficient methods and tools to model extremes events, and abstract or overly-complex models.",
      "She noted that, while climate models have previously focused on biophysical processes, the integration of macroeconomic impacts and other human dimensions of global change are also needed.",
      "She suggested that to effect changes in the 'real world,' V&A assessments should address the needs of a broader range of stakeholder groups.",
      "This would require model developers to, inter alia: address short- or medium-term variability; make models accessible to a wider range of stakeholders; and integrate climate change modeling impacts into planning across levels of decision-making.",
      "She concluded that modeling was only one approach to assess impacts and response measures to climate change. Olga Pilifosova, UNFCCC Secretariat, described the work of the Secretariat in collecting and disseminating information on methods and tools to assess climate impacts and V&A measures in a Compendium that was first developed in 1999, and updated in 2003.",
      "She explained that, with the Compendium, the Secretariat had sought to enhance dissemination of such methods, encourage application of best available methods, and improve the quality of these methodologies.",
      "She noted that the Compendium was not prescriptive, but provided users with the information needed to make their own choices.",
      "She also presented the results of an expert meeting held in Manila on 25-26 April 2004, where users proposed further additions and improvements to the compendium. Madeleine Diouf, Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Senegal, briefed participants on NAPAs, focusing on the immediate needs and concerns of LDCs, including technical requirements, and resource mobilization.",
      "She outlined the NAPA process, which she said was designed to respond to the urgent needs of LDCs.",
      "She explained that preparing a NAPA takes 12-18 months, costs US$200,000, and requires external financial resources.",
      "Diouf identified an increase in vector- and water-borne diseases, flooding, biodiversity loss, and desertification as key consequences of climate change in LDCs.",
      "She stressed that NAPAs help identify and prioritize options and tools to address such problems. In the ensuing discussion participants drew attention to the PRECIS regional impact assessment model developed by the UK`s Hadley Centre and asked about its status.",
      "UNDP informed participants that the model and an accompanying workbook would be made available at SB-20. Replying to a question from Burkina Faso about funding assistance for preparing NAPAs, Madeleine Diouf stated that a number of countries working through UNEP had already received financing.",
      "UNDP acknowledged that there had been a delay in disbursing funds to countries working through UNDP due to 'administrative problems.",
      "' Martha Perdomo, UNFCCC Secretariat, indicated that many of the numerous resources available on national communications would be compiled into a CD-ROM that would be distributed at the end of this workshop. On Tuesday afternoon, the session on adaptation resumed with a presentation from William Dougherty, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI)-Boston, who provided an overview of the UNDP APF and its outputs.",
      "He explained that the APF aims to build 'resilience' and help communities cope with climate change.",
      "He stated that the APF places adaptation within a development context by building on existing adaptation activities, recognizing that adaptation is required at different levels - in particular at the local level, and acknowledging that adaptation is a continuous process.",
      "Operationally, he explained that the APF looks at coordination and implementation and aims to be flexible.",
      "It can be tailored to suit national priorities and the key vulnerable systems identified in each country, and takes a stakeholder-driven approach.",
      "Dougherty reported that APF outputs include a resource 'package,' which contains a guidebook to facilitate the APF planning process, as well as nine technical papers, a five-module training package and an illustrative set of case studies.",
      "He indicated that the APF`s first phase, which ended in early 2004, had completed the framework and was aiming to put in place an APF Training Strategy.",
      "Phase two will follow shortly with a new series of technical papers. Presenting an overview of the APF Training Strategy, Dougherty told participants that it utilizes a technique of Continuous Professional Development (CPD), and goes beyond conventional five-day training workshops.",
      "CPD is intended for longer durations, and customized material will be provided for different professional groups.",
      "There will also be an emphasis on local ownership of outcomes, as well as stronger feedback and evaluation mechanisms.",
      "Dougherty added that CPD will focus on three major areas - food security, water and health - along with the crosscutting issue of sustainable livelihoods. Luis Paz Castro, Institute of Meteorology, Cuba, presented his perspective on the APF in the context of second national communications, focusing on initiatives occurring in Central America and the Caribbean.",
      "Noting that this is the pilot region for elaborating and applying the APF, he described Cuba`s involvement in an APF pilot project on Capacity Building for Stage II Adaptation to Climate Change in Central America, Mexico and Cuba (Stage II activities are measures which may be taken to prepare for adaptation, including further capacity building).",
      "The project aims to strengthen the adaptive capacity of the human system to reduce vulnerability to climate change.",
      "He then outlined the synergies and coordination achieved between this project and others in the region.",
      "Reflecting on Cuba`s experiences with the pilot project, he drew several conclusions, including that adaptation is a process that should begin with a reduction of vulnerability to current climate variability.",
      "He also stressed the need for cooperation, emphasizing that a single country does not possess the capacity and experience needed to develop all the necessary policies and actions to adapt to climate variability and climate change."
