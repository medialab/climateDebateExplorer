      "The non-group on QELROs began consideration of a revised negotiating text.",
      "Several delegates asked for discussion to be suspended until the following day to give Parties a chance to read and consider the text.",
      "On the purpose of the agreement, one Party proposed that QELROs should apply to the weighted average global warming potential based on a one hundred year time line of anthropogenic emissions rather than simply the weighted total.",
      "On methodologies, one Party noted that it has still not been decided whether the methodologies will be decided upon by the Conference of Parties or Meeting of Parties. On criteria for the addition of GHGs to the Annex, a delegate proposed that the criteria should be considered as suggested rather than mandatory.",
      "One delegation proposed that the Parties shall review and revise global warming potentials and methodologies.",
      "On the nature of target and baseline, many delegations were confused as to the various options outlined in the text.",
      "One delegation was concerned that the text had been drafted so that budget periods were inherently linked to flat rate targets with no consideration of budget periods for differentiated targets.",
      "The chair suspended the meeting while several delegations discussed the text.",
      "No agreement was reached by the delegations and the meeting was adjourned."
