      "Delegates were celebrating in several contact groups Wednesday at the completion of their work.",
      "In particular, the conclusion of discussions on non-Annex I Parties` submissions of national communications, which have been under negotiation for two and a half years, resulted in 'a collective sigh of relief,' according to one observer. Meanwhile the decision to forward ongoing debates over the Special Climate Change Fund to Montreal was a sign of SB 22`s 'technical' and 'low key' nature, according to several participants.",
      "'At this stage, anything remotely political or problematic will likely end up on the COP or COP/MOP`s plate,' said one delegate."
