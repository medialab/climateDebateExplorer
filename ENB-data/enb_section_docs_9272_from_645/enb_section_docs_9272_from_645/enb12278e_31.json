      "The remaining discussions under this agenda item concerned further IPCC work on aerosols.",
      "NGGIP Task Force Co-Chair Hiraishi presented the report of the expert meeting on Emission Estimation of Aerosols Relevant to Climate Change, held from 2-4 May 2005, in Geneva, Switzerland (IPCC-XXIV/INF.",
      "4), noting that participants concluded that a number of uncertainties remain regarding global inventories of aerosol emissions relevant to climate change, including in the estimation of carbonaceous measurement methods.",
      "He proposed that a follow-up meeting be held in 2007, and that a substantive agenda be finalized after completion of the AR4 reports of the working groups, to ensure synergies in the IPCC (IPCC-XXIV/Doc.",
      "9). WG I Co-Chair Solomon noted some concerns with the proposal, including: the need to avoid overlap with the work of WG I; the need to ensure that the NGGIP works within the IPCC`s mandate; and that insufficient scientific knowledge exists for developing methodologies on aerosols.",
      "New Zealand, with Austria and Hungary, and opposed by the Russian Federation, said the IPCC should defer consideration of further work on aerosols until the AR4 is completed.",
      "France, Germany and China questioned whether work on aerosols is sufficiently advanced to give rise to work on inventories. In response to comments from delegates, Co-Chair Hiraishi noted aerosols would not be included in the 2006 Guidelines, and that the NGGIP simply wished to consider how its expertise could assist others with research.",
      "Given uncertainties however, he said that the proposal could be postponed.",
      "Delegates agreed to postpone consideration of further work until after completion of the AR4."
