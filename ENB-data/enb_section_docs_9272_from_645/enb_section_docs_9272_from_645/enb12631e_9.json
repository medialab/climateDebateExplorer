      "In the afternoon, the second session convened, focusing on climate change training and international cooperation.",
      "Facilitator Katarzyna Snyder (Poland) opened by summarizing lessons from the first session, held on Tuesday, 2 June, including the need to engage more voices from outside the UNFCCC in the Dialogue, in particular educators and decision makers. Moustapha Kamal Gueye, International Labour Organization, shared lessons from studies and programmes on green jobs, including that climate change and low-carbon policies are expected to result in net gains in employment, but these gains are achieved by design rather than default.",
      "He stressed that climate policies should create jobs that meet decent work criteria and advance social inclusion. Presentations explored, inter alia: teacher training in sustainability education in Brazil; solar power sector training in Bangladesh; world-wide citizen consultations; and international cooperation on climate change training, citing best practices from Finland.",
      "Break-out working groups also convened. Concluding the event, SBI Chair Yauvoli suggested that work under Article 6 builds the broad public understanding needed to take the negotiations forward, and the 3rd Dialogue will enable implementing education and training initiatives towards this goal."
