      "In the afternoon informal consultations on a shared vision for long-term cooperative action, different views were expressed on clustering the issues listed for consideration, with some developing country parties preferring to discuss all issues equally rather than separating them into tasks to be implemented or issues to be concluded.",
      "Parties also addressed the global goal for emission reductions by 2050.",
      "It was noted that the COP agreed to consider this issue at COP 17.",
      "A number of developed countries outlined their national emission reduction goals, and several parties identified the need to allow different peaking years for developed and developing countries.",
      "Parties also highlighted the need: to consider the cluster of social and humanitarian issues; to consider a global carbon budget alongside a global goal; for a compilation paper by the Secretariat taking into account data on emission caps and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.",
      "A number of delegates lamented that further informal consultations on this issue had not been scheduled and urged more time to consider the issue before Durban."
