      "This item was discussed in plenary on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "IPCC Secretary Christ introduced a proposal for a Policy and Process for Admitting Observer Organizations to the IPCC (IPCC-XXIV/Doc.",
      "Discussions centered on: additional criteria for the admittance of organizations, as suggested by the Netherlands, the need for any admission policy to be consistent with the principles of the IPCC, as noted by China, and the role of observer organizations in facilitating transparency and confidence in organizations, as noted by Hungary, the US and others.",
      "The Russian Federation stated that observer organizations should only be allowed to attend plenary discussions and not other IPCC meetings.",
      "Chair Pachauri noted that the proposal only calls for observers to attend plenary discussions.",
      "Switzerland said that attendance by observers is an aspect of outreach. The US, with support from Switzerland, suggested that this issue be revisited at IPCC-25, to allow time for members to consider the policy and to provide the Secretariat with any suggested amendments.",
      "Delegates agreed to this suggestion and that, in the interim, the Secretariat will provide delegates with a list of existing observers and those who have asked to become observers, revise the proposal based on input from governments, and present it at the next IPCC Bureau meeting before consideration at IPCC-25."
