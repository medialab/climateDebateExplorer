      "With the contact group on the SCCF underway, and negotiations on the Secretariat`s programme budget picking up pace, some observers decided to call Wednesday the 'show us the money' day.",
      "This had probably less to do with the contact group discussions, and more to do with the informal meeting of delegates attempting to figure out their burden sharing arrangements to implement their 'strong political commitment to climate change funding for developing countries, ' made over two years ago during COP-6 part II.",
      "Meanwhile in New York, negotiations took place in the second committee of the UNGA on a request to fund UNFCCC conference services from the regular UN budget, which according to one delegate is expected to result in a precedent-setting vote later today."
