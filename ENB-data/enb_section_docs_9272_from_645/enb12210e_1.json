      "EGTT Chair William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu highlighted the importance of transferring ESTs in implementing the UNFCCC.",
      "He drew attention to UNFCCC Article 4.5, which calls on Annex II Parties (developed country Parties) to take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance technology transfer, particularly to developing countries.",
      "He observed that the Marrakesh Accords agreed to at COP-7 had established a framework for technology transfer, and had constituted the EGTT to support this work.",
      "He reported that the EGTT had formally convened twice and developed a work programme, and the challenge now is to move from discussion to supporting actual implementation of technology transfer.",
      "Stating that timely and appropriate technology transfer remains largely a 'mirage,' he called for greater collaborative efforts among all Parties to bridge the 'ever increasing [technology] gap' between developing and developed countries. Wanna Tanunchaiwatana, Manager of the UNFCCC`s Technology Subprogramme, presented an overview of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, noting that 106 countries have ratified the Protocol to date, and that this represents 43% of developed country emissions (55% is required for the Protocol to enter into force).",
      "Reflecting on technology transfer under the UNFCCC, she highlighted recent work in this area, including the technology needs assessments conducted in over 60 countries, and the information exchange facilitated by the TT:CLEAR website (http://ttclear.unfccc.int/).",
      "She said this workshop would provide input on the draft technical paper on enabling environments that had been called for by SBSTA- 17 and prepared for the Secretariat.",
      "The workshop would also help identify possible next steps to promote enabling environments, as well as further actions to enhance work on technology needs assessments.",
      "Identifying upcoming challenges and tasks for the EGTT, she said it would need to consult with other groups that address 'developing country issues' under the UNFCCC, in order to identify cross-cutting issues and potential synergies."
