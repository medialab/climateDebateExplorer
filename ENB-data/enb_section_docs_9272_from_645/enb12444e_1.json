      "During an evening meeting of the AWG-KP plenary, Chair Ashe informed delegates on informal consultations following the African Group s intervention during the opening plenary on Monday that they would not accept scheduling of other contact group meetings under the AWG-KP until the completion of work on Annex I emission reductions.",
      "Chair Ashe explained that consultations had continued late into the night on Monday and resumed on Tuesday morning, and that a solution had been found to allocate 60% of the remaining time to the contact group on Annex I emission reductions.",
      "He proposed, and parties agreed, to adopt this as a method of work in Barcelona.",
      "The Gambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, emphasized the Group s desire for legally binding targets from the AWG-KP in Copenhagen.",
      "Stressing that the current level of ambition from developed countries is unacceptable, he emphasized the need for ambitious numbers in line with science.",
      "He warned that failure to achieve progress on this issue could lead to another suspension of the other contact groups.",
      "The African Group also stated that all pledges should include a breakdown of the respective contribution of domestic emission reductions, offsets and LULUCF. CHINA, SUDAN, INDIA, BOLIVIA, SAUDI ARABIA and Grenada, for AOSIS, supported the African Group s statement and highlighted that the solution refers not only to time devoted to numbers, but also to the need for progress on concrete, specific and ambitious numbers.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA stressed that parties reserved the right to reevaluate progress on numbers at the end of each day.",
      "BRAZIL urged using the allocated time effectively, and with INDONESIA, stressed that the issue of numbers is the benchmark for success in Barcelona.",
      "Grenada, for AOSIS, called for a focused, urgent and meaningful response to the numbers issue."
