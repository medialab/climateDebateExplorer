      "After a morning contact group, parties convened informally in the afternoon and exchanged views on guidance for national forest monitoring systems and measuring, reporting and verification (MRV).",
      "On national forest monitoring systems, some parties indicated that the information monitored should be selected by each country implementing REDD+.",
      "Some parties also underscored that information requirements should be coherent with those applicable to nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs).",
      "One party stressed that the monitoring system should be a process established in a gradual manner.",
      "Another party highlighted that non-market approaches should also be considered and that data on other issues, such as ecosystem services, should be included.",
      "A number of parties emphasized that the system should be built on existing national monitoring systems.",
      "While some parties supported inviting the IPCC to provide further information on methodological issues, others opposed, with one party suggesting that this could be useful at a later stage.",
      "Many underscored the relevance of capacity building for the preparation of a robust and transparent monitoring system.",

      "Timor Leste, for LDCs, welcomed the technical paper on assessing the risk of loss and damage (FCCC/TP/2012/1) and report on the expert meeting held in Tokyo, Japan, from 26-28 March 2012 (FCCC/SBI/2012/INF.3) as a good basis for substantive discussions.",
      "He also expressed concern over a capacity gap. AOSIS identified areas in need of support for SIDS.",
      "The US identified the need for data on physical determinants and socio-economic drivers of risk as well as on human vulnerability.",
