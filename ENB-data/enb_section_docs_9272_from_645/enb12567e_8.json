      "In its decision (FCCC/CP/2012/L.17), the COP requests the GCF Board and the Republic of Korea to: conclude the legal and administrative arrangements for hosting the GCF; ensure that juridical personality and legal capacity are conferred to the GCF; and the necessary privileges and immunities are granted to the GCF and its officials.",
      "The COP decides to provide initial guidance to the GCF at COP 19.",
      "The COP requests the GCF Board to report to COP 19 on the implementation of decision 3/CP.17.",
      "The COP reaffirms its decision that the interim arrangements should terminate no later than COP 19.",
      "Arrangements between the COP and GCF: On this issue (FCCC/CP/2012/5, FCCC/CP/2012/CRP.1, and FCCC/CP/2012/CRP.4), parties disagreed on which body should be responsible for drafting the arrangements between the GCF and the COP.",
      "The US and Japan stated that the key elements of the arrangements were already agreed on; the GCF has independent juridical authority operating under the guidance of the COP, and is therefore capable of drafting the arrangements.",
      "Barbados, for AOSIS, cautioned against reopening the GCF governing instrument.",
      "He suggested a process to develop the arrangements with representatives from the COP and the GCF Board.",
      "South Africa said the GCF Governing Instrument already includes elements that would allow the work on arrangements to be concluded in Doha.",
      "Saudi Arabia, supported by Kenya and Zambia, for the least developed countries (LDCs), expressed concern about the GCF drafting its own accountability relationship, suggesting that the Standing Committee should undertake this task.",
      "Colombia, on behalf of Peru and Guatemala, proposed that representatives of the COP, possibly through the Standing Committee and the GCF Board, work on drafting the arrangements.",
      "The EU supported developing the arrangements in a cooperative manner and suggested a draft proposal be submitted for consideration by relevant bodies and approval by COP 19."
