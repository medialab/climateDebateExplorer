      "The Bonn Climate Change Conference opened on Monday morning, 1 June.",
      "UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres said this session should be seen as \"a construction site\" for the Subsidiary Bodies and the ADP to pave the way for the 2015 agreement. In a recorded video address, COP 20/CMP 10 President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Minister of Environment, Peru, stated that the Paris outcome could include: a legally binding core instrument; a target for carbon neutrality; a process for the regular communication of nationally determined contributions (NDCs); a long-term qualitative goal for adaptation; substantial progress on climate finance; provisions on loss and damage; and the launch of a global effort to scale up technology and capacity building. Incoming COP 21/CMP 11 President Laurent Fabius, Foreign Minister, France, urged progress on: distinguishing what will be included in the agreement versus COP decisions; determining the major political issues that ministers must decide upon; and preparing a decision on pre-2020 action for adoption in Paris. The work of ADP 2-9, SBSTA 42 and SBI 42 are summarized below."
