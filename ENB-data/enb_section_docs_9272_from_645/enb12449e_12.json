      "Chair Ashe introduced the agenda item, noting that this would be divided into four main components, namely: Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reduction commitments ( numbers ); other issues identified in paragraph 49(c) of the report of AWG-KP 6 (FCCC/AWG/2008/8); potential consequences; and legal matters.",
      "He said that in accordance with the agreement reached at AWG-KP 9 in Barcelona, 60% of the available time would be allocated to the numbers group.",
      "Parties subsequently agreed to establish four contact groups on: Annex I emission reductions, co-chaired by Leon Charles (Grenada) and Gertraud Wollansky (Austria); other issues, chaired by AWG-KP Vice-Chair Harald Dovland (Norway); potential consequences, co-chaired by Mama Konat\u00e9 (Mali) and Andrew Ure (Australia); and legal matters, co-chaired by Mar\u00eda Andrea Alb\u00e1n Dur\u00e1n (Colombia) and Gerhard Loibl (Austria), to meet only if requested by the other contact groups.",
      "Chair Ashe said the groups will focus on preparing draft Protocol amendments and COP/MOP decisions and that, if unable to do so, they will at a minimum develop text with a limited number of clearly defined options from which ministers can choose."
