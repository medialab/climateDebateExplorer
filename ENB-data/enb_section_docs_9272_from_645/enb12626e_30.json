      "With the Geneva text securely in the hands of the Secretariat for formal editing and translation, delegates have over three months to get ready for negotiations at the next session of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies in June, with informal meetings at the negotiator level scheduled in April and May, and informal ministerial meetings in March and May.",
      "Leaving the Palais des Nations, many delegates seemed cautiously optimistic about Paris.",
      "Undoubtedly, since 2009 there have been some important realignments in historical allegiances, with many new negotiating groups and alliances, some of them bridging the traditional developed and developing country divide.",
      "The US has also recently entered into some important bilateral agreements with China and India.",
      "While a chasm exists between those who advocate for maintaining the status quo, and those who want to move beyond the Kyoto world, much hard political bargaining will be necessary to broker a solution to the deadlock that affects international climate governance.",
      "The Geneva negotiating text has formally put parties on a course to make history and address what has been termed as the greatest challenge facing mankind.",
      "Time will tell whether they will succeed."
