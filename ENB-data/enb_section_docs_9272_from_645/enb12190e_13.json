   "sentences": [
      "Ayit\u00e9-lo Ajavon (Togo) chaired the Working Group on greenhouse gas inventories.",
      "The Working Group considered conclusions from the Panama workshop, relating to: institutional issues - preparation and reporting of inventories; technical issues - collection of activity data and development of local and/or regional emissions factors; methodological issues - revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines; use of the UNFCCC Guidelines; financial and technological needs and constraints; and recommendations relating to all of the above. In their consideration of the conclusions of the Panama workshop, delegates took into account analyses of greenhouse gas inventories based on non-Annex I national communications since the Panama workshop, prepared by the Secretariat in the form of matrices displaying different issues contained in the reports on a country- by-country basis to allow inter-country comparison, as well as the presentations they heard earlier in the day. Providing general comments, the UNFCCC Secretariat and others noted that there was little contained in the new national communications that would contradict the conclusions from the Panama workshop, although more detail could be added from these new reports.",
      "Brazil stressed that the situation in each country is unique and cautioned against making very specific recommendations, while Chair Ajavon called for flexibility and a contextual understanding of the needs of different countries.",
      "Many delegates urged a substantive discussion rather than a focus on textual details. On institutional issues relating to the preparation and reporting of inventories, some delegates supported defining the resources countries need in order to collect the necessary activity data for estimating greenhouse gas emissions, stressing that these resources are human, technical and financial. On technical details relating to the collection of activity data and development of local and/or regional emission factors, Iran called for more information on the source and method of calculation of the IPCC emission factors to allow countries to evaluate the certainty and appropriateness of the default figures.",
      "Ghana pointed to deviations between developed and developing countries in terms of typical emission factors and called for the development of emission factors more appropriate to national circumstances in non-Annex I countries.",
      "The IPCC cautioned that information additional to that already provided would be difficult to produce, but said it is doing what it can to improve the figures.",
      "Chair Ajavon said that as the emission factors always contain a degree of uncertainty it is better to use national or regional rather than default figures where possible.",
      "Chile supported adding reference to country-specific issues, such as the need for data on the fishing industry in Peru or steppe fires in Mongolia. On recommendations under this topic, the IPCC clarified that developing a database on emission factors, as recommended at the Panama workshop, referred to an IPCC database.",
      "He noted that only one such database currently exists, but said the intention was to regionalize it at a later date.",
      "Iran and others called for a recommendation for regional projects to develop regional emission factors that are technology specific.",
      "China emphasized that activity data cannot be required when countries do not have the capacity for producing it.",
      "Brazil noted that it is up to each country to define the extent of its capacity in this regard, and said this should not be externally imposed. On methodological issues relating to the revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines, delegates proposed including new examples drawn from the national communications submitted since the Panama workshop.",
      "However, they indicated that in all other respects, the Panama workshop conclusions could be considered still valid.",
      "Regarding methodological issues related to the energy sector in non-Annex I countries, Iran proposed adding 'coal' to 'gas and oil' in a comment noting that specific conditions of fugitive methane emissions are not taken into account in the IPCC Guidelines.",
      "He also proposed reference to both 'hot and cold flaring' rather than just flaring.",
      "Uruguay said it should be noted that not all countries use both the sectoral and default approaches, and that even if they do, some do not compare them.",
      "In response to a comment from Colombia, the UNFCCC Secretariat noted that the IPCC is currently working to improve the Guidelines with regard to the forestry and land use sector.",
      "Some delegates shared their experiences with the use of the guidelines in this sector.",
      "The Secretariat proposed that a paragraph should be added on encouraging Parties to develop methods for specific sectors and industries for inclusion in the next revision of the IPCC Guidelines for preparing inventories. On the use of the UNFCCC Guidelines for preparing national communications, the Secretariat noted that the analysis of their use would have to be updated to include the national communications submitted since the Panama workshop.",
      "He said, however, that he did not foresee any substantive changes to the Panama conclusions.",
      "Ghana asked that there be more elaboration on when Parties should use the 'not available' and 'not obtainable' notation keys when preparing their national communications."
