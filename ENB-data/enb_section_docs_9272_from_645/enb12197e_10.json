      "Co-Chair Suk-Hoon Woo (Republic of Korea) introduced draft conclusions for consideration by the group, noting that the text was based on language used in the relevant COP-7 decision (13/CP.7). The EU, CANADA, AUSTRALIA and others endorsed the text as a good basis for further discussion.",
      "Stressing that good practice in P&Ms applies to Annex I Parties, SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/CHINA, proposed inserting reference to this in all appropriate parts of the text. On a paragraph requesting the Secretariat to organize a stock taking exercise and exchange of views immediately before SB-17, the EU, SAMOA, POLAND and SWITZERLAND preferred this exercise to take the form of an intersessional informal consultation, while the US, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and SAUDI ARABIA favored holding a side event. On text agreeing on a 'frame for action' to consider further steps to advance work on P&Ms, the US proposed limiting the reference to considering further steps 'in implementing decision 13/CP.7.",
      "' The EU, SAMOA, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA and JAPAN preferred the original formulation, or variations on this formulation.",
      "Co-Chair Pierre Giroux said a revised text would be produced in time for the next meeting on Wednesday."
