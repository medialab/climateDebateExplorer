      "On emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transport (bunker fuels), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) reported on relevant work (FCCC/SBSTA/2012/MISC.20). JAPAN and SINGAPORE said that ICAO and IMO are the appropriate bodies to address this issue.",
      "JAPAN stated that global regulations should apply universally to all aircraft or ships, regardless of country of operation or registration and, therefore, the CBDR principle should not apply.",
      "CUBA, on behalf of Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Malaysia, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, underscored the need to apply the CBDR principle and stated that a decision on this issue must await a decision on financial support.",
      "CHINA, supported by EGYPT, stated CBDR is a basic principle of international climate change negotiations and should apply to international aviation and shipping."
