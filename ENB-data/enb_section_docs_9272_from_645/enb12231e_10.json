      "In the SBSTA Plenary on Monday, 1 December, Parties called for the identification of options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from civil aviation.",
      "They also proposed that SBSTA work with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to achieve further progress, urged a more proactive role than information gathering on emissions from aviation and maritime transportation, and encouraged SBSTA to support programmes for improving maritime and aviation emissions estimates. Chair Thorgeirsson requested Helen Plume (New Zealand) to conduct informal consultations on the matter.",
      "In the SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 9 December, Plume said Parties had been unable to remove all of the brackets from the draft conclusions on emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transportation.",
      "Following discussions in Plenary, Parties agreed to remove the brackets.",
      "SBSTA adopted the conclusions, as amended."
