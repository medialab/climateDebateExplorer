      "As negotiations opened on Monday morning, delegates immediately found themselves in the hot seat as IPCC Rajendra Pachauri challenged delegates to 'come to terms' with the fact that staying below the 2 \u00b0C target requires zero or negative emissions, relative to 2010 levels, by 2100.",
      "The literal heat of the venue prompted one delegate to exclaim 'this is just like a greenhouse and this is exactly what's happening to our planet'.",
      "'Last October, those of us who were at the Convention for Biological Diversity COP in Pyeongchang, South Korea, were subjected to cold temperature extremes; now we're being tried by fire', complained another.",
      "Yet, while many took off their jackets following the COP President's exhortation, one observer lamented that 'the generic opening statements did not signal that delegates were ready to roll up their sleeves'.",
      "Some participants suggested that Lima's success will hinge on the 'long overdue fulfillment of promised leadership roles', with others pointing to 'positive signals' of emission reduction or limitation targets announced by the EU, the US and China, and the pledges of US$9.7 billion for the GCF.",
      "'The heat is on', said a long-time observer, 'we'll see if these signals will restore trust and facilitate progress toward an agreement in Paris over the next two weeks'."
