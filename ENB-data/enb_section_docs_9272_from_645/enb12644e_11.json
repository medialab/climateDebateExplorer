      "Tuvalu, for the LDCs, stated that modalities for mitigation and MOI may differ, and that parties should individually and collectively increase ambition.",
      "Colombia, for AILAC, noted the issue of collective or individual commitments with regard to finance is being addressed in the finance section.",
      "Sudan, for the African Group, called for discussing adequacy, explaining that the legal force of its members\u00a7 undertakings would depend on developed countries\u00a7 delivery of finance.",
      "On communication and adjustment of commitments/contributions/actions, Canada said provisions on upfront information should be captured in decision text.",
      "The US supported successive contributions every five years and proposed a simple consultative period for the consideration of INDCs without a top-down review.",
      "AILAC emphasized the principles of progression and no backsliding.",
      "Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, stressed that many developing countries base their INDCs on the delivery of MOI.",
      "Noting the need for flexibility in the communication provision, the African Group called for defining both individual efforts and information to be provided to ensure transparency, clarity and effective aggregate consideration.",

      "India stated the review could be a reference tool but should not prescribe individual efforts.",
      "China cautioned against \"a naming and shaming approach.\" He proposed identifying implementation gaps, sharing best practices and including cooperative efforts.",
      "The US said an aggregate review could include: what parties collectively implemented; types of challenges; and opportunities for enhanced international cooperation and support in light of enabling environments.",
      "On timing, the Marshall Islands stressed the importance of a common timeframe on mitigation contributions.",
      "In the context of mitigation, he proposed four steps: communication of proposed commitments; a 12-month ex ante process to assess aggregate effect; a process for inscription; and stocktaking of commitments.",
      "Several parties supported a five-year cycle for a global review of mitigation contributions.",
      "The LMDCs suggested parties decide for themselves on either five- or ten-year timeframes of individual contributions.",
      "Singapore questioned whether linking the collective review to a common cycle for reporting would be realistic.",

      "Many supported including a general stocktaking of global progress in the agreement.",
      "Brazil suggested the agreement establish a process for stocktaking, with output timed at least one year before parties submit revised nationally determined contributions (NDCs).",
      "The EU suggested a synthesis report as the \"output\" of the stocktaking and that the latest science be among its \"inputs.\" On adjustments of NDCs, several parties emphasized the voluntary nature of adjustments to NDCs, with the EU underlining this should be compatible with progress towards a long-term goal in the agreement.",
      "Zimbabwe, for the African Group, called for an article defining communication of the different types of undertakings, with flexibility for parties with limited capacity.",
      "Tuvalu, for the LDCs, suggested that: the term \"NDCs\" refers to mitigation; the term \"contributions\" does not apply to adaptation; and a parallel timing process for MOI is needed.",
      "On Friday, the Marshall Islands reported back to the group that discussions in the joint spin-off group focused on different options for housing, including annexes to the agreement, schedules, registries, contribution documents, attachments as well as their potential legal, political and practical implications.",
      "Saint Lucia requested the Co-Facilitators to take note of its proposal for an Annex III to house parties\u00a7 nationally determined mitigation commitments.",
      "Co-Facilitator Dondisch then presented, and delegates commented on, a list of key elements for the section on Timeframes with summary points reflecting discussions of the group on the issues of: stocktaking/review; maintenance of commitments/contributions/actions; upgrading of successive commitments/contributions/actions; and adjustment to NDCs.",
      "The list also notes: ambition, progression, positive collective process, transparency, dynamism, and differentiation as issues to be taken into consideration; as well as initial INDCs and housing as issues where more clarity is needed.",
      "Parties expressed their preference to use language from the Co-Chairs\u00a7 Tool.",
      "The Co-Facilitators agreed to provide the list of key elements for this section, with parties\u00a7 comments, to the ADP Co-Chairs."
