   "sentences": [
      "Discussions on this agenda item focused on the key elements outlined in the Bali Action Plan (decision 1/ CP.13), including a shared vision for long-term cooperative action, mitigation, adaptation, technology and financing.",
      "Three in-session workshops were held on: a shared vision for long-term cooperative action; risk management and risk reduction strategies, including risk sharing and transfer mechanisms such as insurance; and cooperation on research and development of current, new and innovative technology, including win-win solutions.",
      "An informal ministerial round table on a shared vision was also held.",
      "For more details of these workshops and the round table see: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12387e.html , http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12388e.html , http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12389e.html , http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12391e.html and http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12394e.html When this item was introduced on 1 December, Chair Machado explained that when the AWG-LCA concluded its third session in Accra, he had been invited to prepare an assembly document ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2008/16 ) bringing together the ideas and proposals presented by parties (FCCC/AWGLCA/2008/MISC.5 and Add.1) on the elements contained in paragraph 1 of the Bali Action Plan, taking into account the ideas and proposals presented by accredited observer organizations (FCCC/AWGLCA/2008/MISC.6), and to make this assembly document available for the fourth session of the AWG-LCA in Pozna\u00c5\".",
      "Chair Machado also explained that he would update this assembly document before the close of the session in Pozna\u00c5\", taking into account a new round of submissions requested by 6 December, as well as the discussions held in Pozna\u00c5\".",
      "Chair Machado subsequently proposed four contact groups on a shared vision, mitigation and means of implementation, adaptation and means of implementation, and delivering on technology and financing (including institutional arrangements).",
      "A lengthy debate ensued on the merits of establishing a contact group on a shared vision.",
      "Algeria, with Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, China, Malaysia and Egypt, opposed this as being premature.",
      "The general sentiment was that the contact group was unnecessary taking into account the in-session workshop on a shared vision and the informal ministerial round table on the same matter.",
      "Several parties said discussions on a shared vision should therefore be informed by outcomes of the round table and workshop.",
      "However, Japan, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Barbados, the EU, Ghana and Australia supported the establishment of the shared vision contact group maintaining that this had been agreed at AWG-LCA 3.",
      "After informal consultations, delegates agreed to establish all four contact groups, with only one session scheduled for the shared vision group.",
      "These discussions are outlined in the relevant sections below.",
      "On 10 December, Chair Machado introduced the updated assembly document (FCCC/AWGLCA/2008/16/Rev.1), indicating that there had now been 164 submissions in total, amounting to more than 1000 pages of input.",
      "He suggested that this demonstrates the active interest and engagement of parties, and said the text would provide a strong basis for work in 2009.",
      "The AWG-LCA then approved a draft COP decision that welcomes the assembly document.",
      "This decision was adopted by the COP on 12 December (FCCC/CP/2008/L.4).",
      "The in-depth discussions in plenary and contact groups held on a shared vision, mitigation, adaptation, and technology and financing, are set out in the section below, followed by a summary of the COP decision."
