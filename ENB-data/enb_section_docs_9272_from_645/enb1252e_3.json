      "At its morning session, the non-group discussed the Chair`s consolidated text on dispute resolution.",
      "Most of the text remains in brackets.",
      "There was general agreement that there should be provision for the possibility of a multilateral co-operative process, while decisions about its relation to AG13 (Multilateral Consultative Process) were left open. In the afternoon, Parties engaged in a detailed exchange on the core issue of the relationship that will be established between the COP/FCCC and any new protocol or other legal instrument.",
      "While there was general support for 'institutional economy,' whereby the COP shall serve as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol, opposing views were put forward on what procedural rights the COP would have in regard to the Protocol.",
      "Some developing countries were uneasy with the prospect of the Protocol developing a life of its own, and eventually subsuming the FCCC.",
      "They argued for the right of all Parties to the Convention to propose amendments to a Protocol.",
      "A number of developed country Parties argued that this would not be legally possible and that such a right should derive only from ratification.",
      "Some indicated a concern that non-Parties would exercise influence over the Protocol without coming into a new process at some stage. Much of the argument revolved around Parties` use of the word 'integral' when describing the Protocol`s relationship to the COP/FCCC.",
      "A decisive intervention came when a delegate with legal expertise suggested that Parties were confusing a political and legal understanding of the term.",
      "In Article 16.1 (FCCC), for example, the word integral is used to describe annexes which legally become part and parcel of the FCCC upon adoption.",
      "In such cases the provisions of the FCCC are used exclusively where amendments are required.",
      "He argued that it was not possible to describe a Protocol as integral in the same sense.",
      "A Protocol would not be legally part and parcel of the FCCC.",
      "If this were not so, there would be no need to negotiate formal and separate mechanisms for amending and ratifying a Protocol, an independent legal instrument.",
      "It was fair, however, to describe the Protocol as politically integral to the FCCC. This distinction was heavily criticized by developing country Parties who continued to argue that a Protocol would be intimately bound up with the FCCC and subordinate, citing FCCC Articles 4.2 (a) and (b) on Annex I Party commitments, and 7.2, which affirms that the COP, as supreme body, shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention 'and any related legal instrument.",
      "' The Chair is expected to produce a revised text including a draft Preamble affirming that a Protocol will be intimately bound up with the FCCC, with Articles underlining their dependence on the FCCC process. In the discussion on annexes, a number of developing and newly industrialized countries sought to ensure that the status of any Parties included in annexes evolving out of the AGBM agreement would be subject to an amendment procedure as rigorous as that which applies in the FCCC."
