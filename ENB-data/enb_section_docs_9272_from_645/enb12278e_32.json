      "This agenda item was addressed in plenary on Tuesday.",
      "Chair Pachauri introduced the outcomes of the Laxenburg workshop on New Emission Scenarios (IPCC-XXIV/INF.",
      "1), in particular that the IPCC should play a facilitating and coordinating role in the development of new emission scenarios.",
      "He introduced a proposal to establish a Task Group on New Emission Scenarios that would work until IPCC-25 (IPCC-XXIV/Doc.",
      "11), which was approved by delegates after discussions. Hungary underlined the importance of emission scenarios beyond their use by the IPCC, and stressed that the IPCC`s responsibility cannot be reduced to facilitation of the scenario development process.",
      "The Russian Federation underscored the extent to which the IPCC`s work depends upon scenarios.",
      "Austria, New Zealand and many others highlighted the need for new emission scenarios prior to a fifth assessment report (AR5).",
      "Supported by many, the US proposed explicit reference to the Laxenburg workshop in the Task Group mandate.",
      "Belgium, Greenpeace and many others emphasized the need for coherent assumptions and storylines, comparable scenarios, and a wide range of scenarios including economic, demographic and other social factors.",
      "The UK underscored continuity with past emission scenarios, in order not to undermine the work upon which the AR4 is based.",
      "Egypt and others noted the need to engage developing countries.",
      "Chile proposed that the IPCC develop methodology guidelines for the development of national emission scenarios, which would help developing countries.",
      "Spain emphasized the need for temporal and spatial disaggregation of scenarios, and Chile emphasized the relevance of regional scenarios for decision makers.",
      "Kenya expressed concern about the ownership of scenarios developed by other institutions, and associated budgetary implications.",
      "Morocco, noting the risk of scenario proliferation, proposed a work group to clarify a procedure for preparing scenarios that would serve to differentiate between IPCC and non-IPCC scenarios.",
      "Chair Pachauri said comments from the discussions would be reflected in the IPCC-24 report."
