      "This question discusses the interactions between climate change, other environmental issues and sustainable development. Concerning synergies and trade-offs in climate change response options, delegates discussed various means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including a proposal to refer to increasing the use of advanced fossil fuel technologies, rather than the substitution of fossil fuel combustion by renewable energy.",
      "Chair Watson convened a contact group on the proposal.",
      "The contact group agreed to refer to increasing the share of lower carbon emitting fossil fuels, advanced fossil fuel technologies and renewable energy technologies. On linkages between multilateral environmental agreements, participants discussed how to characterize the interaction between multilateral agreements on ozone and climate change.",
      "Several delegates proposed, and the Plenary agreed, to note potential contradictions between the agreements, whereby substances that are replacements for ozone-depleting substances are greenhouse gases."
