    "WHAT NEXT FOR THE IPCC?", 
    "In the words of UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer, the IPCC has been an engine that drives the climate change policy process.", 
    "In 2007, the IPCC s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) conclusively put to rest the skepticism about climate change.", 
    "Its outcomes are globally acknowledged to have played a crucial role in creating momentum for the breakthrough at the historic Bali climate change conference in December, and all indications are that the work of the IPCC will be even more important to spur the commitments and actions generally perceived to be needed in the future.", 
    "Indeed, the IPCC was recognized in 2007 by being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize together with Al Gore for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, described as the most serious environmental crisis the world faces today.", 
    "At this time when the IPCC finds itself at a high point, the main topic on the agenda for the twenty-eighth session was its future.", 
    "The need to address the future comes after the successful completion and dissemination of the AR4, although memories of some of the difficulties and frustrations that are necessarily inherent in such a major undertaking as the AR4 process are still fresh.", 
    "It is understandable then that while calls for improvements resonated widely, and some guidance was agreed to ensure that the most glaring gaps are addressed in the future, the reality that this was a very short meeting, combined with the proven success of the IPCC and a perhaps a need to pause and recoup after the very intense period just undergone, IPCC-28 produced a result that very much maintained the status quo .", 
    "This brief analysis will address the issues underlying the discussions that took place at IPCC-28 on the future of the IPCC, including possible modifications to the Working Group structure and the timeline for the Fifth Assessment cycle, and the changing nature of policy needs."
