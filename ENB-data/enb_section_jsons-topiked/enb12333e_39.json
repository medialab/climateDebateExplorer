    "In its conclusions ( FCCC/SBI/2007/L.5 ), the SBI notes the practices of withholding funding to eligible parties to participate in the UNFCCC process if they have outstanding contributions to the core budget for two years or more, and concludes that this practice has had little effect on the payment of contributions to the core budget and the number of parties that have had access to financial support provided by the Trust Fund for participation in the UNFCCC process.", 
    "The SBI, therefore, requests the Secretariat to discontinue this practice and further requests the Secretariat to urge parties through other means, including issuing reminders, to meet their commitments under the core budget."
