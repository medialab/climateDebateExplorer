    "In the morning session of the informal high-level Plenary, participants engaged in an initial exchange of views on these issues.", 
    "POLAND, for the CENTRAL GROUP ELEVEN, said the treatment of non-compliance should not be based on the Parties, but on the nature of the commitment.", 
    "With the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, she called for flexibility for countries with economies in transition.", 
    "CHINA highlighted that a strict compliance system should be based on Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8, and that Annex I Parties' reports should include information on Protocol Articles 10 (existing commitments) and 11 (financial mechanism), including in relation to additional financial resources.", 
    "He added that the different responsibilities of Annex I and non-Annex I Parties should be reflected in the sections on principles, mandate and consequences.", 
    "He concluded by raising the issue of the bodies' composition and called for adherence to the principles of fairness and equitable geographical representation.", 
    "Pronk said the question of composition was a cross-cutting issue.", 
    "SWITZERLAND said the integrity of the review process requires that the competence of reviewers be a priority, and suggested training as a way to reach both this objective and ensure equitable geographical representation.", 
    "Following a question by President Pronk, he said it was reasonable to have full representation in only one of the two branches of the compliance committee. ARGENTINA expressed concern over the adoption of a compliance regime and a possible amendment of the Protocol before its entry into force.", 
    "Opposed by BRAZIL, he called on Parties not to push for the most comprehensive and complex regime, but one that will be 'viable.", 
    "' On consequences, he said good faith should constitute the main source of confidence in this agreement.", 
    "The US said legally-binding consequences need not be punitive and highlighted that she supported a deduction from the following commitment period with a 1.3% penalty rate as well as a restriction on the transfer of units also applicable to Protocol Article 4 (joint fulfilment) Parties.", 
    "The EU argued that Article 4 is not a mechanism and, commenting on ARGENTINA's intervention, said good faith it not sufficient due to inclusion of market-based mechanisms in the Protocol.", 
    "He explained that legally-binding consequences were thus justified both by concerns over the environmental integrity of the Protocol, as well as by the necessity to provide the private sector with the confidence needed for the use of the mechanisms.", 
    "He added that the rate of deduction should fluctuate between 1 and 1.5% and would constitute an incentive for the Party concerned to use the true-up period to take advantage of the market.", 
    "CANADA said legally-binding consequences were also justified on competitiveness grounds.", 
    "Pronk concluded that good faith and economics should thus guide the consequences to be adopted.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA stressed that non- compliance affects everyone, and not only the trading partners of Annex I Parties.", 
    "She urged that this must be reflected in the composition of the compliance committee. AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION argued for a non-binding regime and said their countries were more concerned about their own compliance than that of others.", 
    "Supporting AUSTRALIA, JAPAN explained that its main trading partners were not the other Annex I Parties but non-Annex I Asian countries.", 
    "CANADA supported the voluntary payments to a compliance fund to deal with mitigation projects.", 
    "IRAN said such a fund should also minimize the adverse impact of response measures.", 
    "AOSIS said payment in a voluntary fund would actually provide Parties with an additional flexible mechanism. On policies and measures (P&Ms), the EU said the participation of non-Annex I Parties in workshops would allow for a valuable exchange of information.", 
    "He said the emissions inventories alone are not comprehensive enough to assess demonstrable progress in 2005, and suggested a COP-7 decision on the information needed in this regard.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA said the whole of Protocol Article 2 - including provision for minimizing adverse effects - should be referred to in the decision.", 
    "He suggested keeping the reference to 'Annex I Parties,' as non-Annex I Parties would otherwise be required to implement these obligations. Delegates also met in closed informal consultations on these issues in the afternoon, although the meeting was cut short when protestors entered the room and disrupted negotiations.", 
    "The consultations were reconvened in the early evening prior to the informal high-level Plenary, where participants heard a report on progress.", 
    "In the Plenary, co-facilitator Minister Bjerke (Norway) highlighted a constructive dialogue and the need for more time, given the interruption of its work.", 
    "On demonstrable progress she said discussions had focused on what to report and when.", 
    "She added that a smaller group had identified a possible compromise.", 
    "This option decides that consideration of demonstrable progress cannot take place until SBSTA has considered this issue pursuant to guidelines that may be elaborated under Article 7, given that Articles 2 and 3.2 provide no mandate for P&Ms to be considered in the context of demonstrable progress.", 
    "She said issues of reporting on Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects) and on supplementarity were not resolved yet and that consultations on Protocol Article 4 (joint fulfillment) were ongoing.", 
    "On compliance, she reported that discussions had focused on consequences. In the discussion that followed, SAUDI ARABIA said the composition of the expert review teams and issues relating to Article 3.14 still needed consideration.", 
    "The EU said a strong compliance regime was a fundamental requirement and AOSIS highlighted the importance it attaches to this issue."
