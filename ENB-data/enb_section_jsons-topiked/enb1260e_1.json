    "AGBM Chair Ra\u00fal Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) reported that AGBM-8 delegates should focus on producing consensus, but noted that many were still 'playing games with brackets.", 
    "' He also said that a new 'non-group' (QELROs-2) chaired by Bo Kjell\u00e9n (Sweden) was established to address some aspects of QELROs, as well as articles related to, inter alia, emissions trading, joint implementation, voluntary commitments, review of national communications and review of commitments.", 
    "The non-group Chairs gave brief statements on the upcoming work of their groups. Responding to questions regarding the US position, announced by President Clinton on Wednesday, he noted that a number of questions would need to be answered.", 
    "He characterized the position as a 'modest' offer but said he was impressed that the US President had taken up the issue himself.", 
    "He said the outcome will depend upon the reaction of other delegations, but noted that a position issued from a Head of State does not leave much room for flexibility. NON-GROUP ON QELROs-1 The US introduced its position as announced by President Clinton on Wednesday.", 
    "The position contained three elements.", 
    "The US will commit to a binding target of returning emissions to 1990 levels in a budget period between 2008 and 2012, to reducing net emissions of all GHGs below 1990 levels in the five-year period thereafter (between 2013 and 2018), and working for further reductions in the years beyond that.", 
    "It also called for a series of flexible market mechanisms, including emissions trading and joint implementation.", 
    "The US will not assume binding obligations unless key developing countries meaningfully participate.", 
    "He said this position reflects the fact that if the entire industrialized world reduces emissions while developing countries continue to grow at their current pace, GHG concentrations will continue to climb. The US also recalled that President Clinton announced a domestic program, including a US$5 billion series of tax incentives and research investments to encourage energy efficiency and the use of cleaner energy.", 
    "He also proposed the creation of a domestic market-based system for reducing emissions that will tie national efforts into a global emissions market. On the discussion of the consolidated negotiating text, there was agreement that 'each' of the Annex I Parties would take on commitments regarding targets.", 
    "Delegates discussed whether Annex I Parties would 'reduce,' 'limit' or 'stabilize' anthropogenic emissions of GHGs with a 'net' or 'aggregate' approach and whether they would do it individually or jointly.", 
    "A regional group favored reducing or limiting emissions of GHGs jointly and with an aggregate approach, but met objection from one country.", 
    "A group of countries proposed that commitments for Annex I Parties be spelled out within the text instead of appearing in an attachment."
