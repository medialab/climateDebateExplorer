    "With the AWGLCA Chair s draft proposal for a work programme circulated Tuesday evening, delegates had something a little more tangible to sink their teeth into before continuing informal discussions on Wednesday.", 
    "At the same time, they were reminded of the amount of work that remains to be done in Bangkok: the distributed text contains little more than a general structure to be filled in during the coming days with details on issues for discussion at upcoming sessions of the AWGLCA and on requests for the Secretariat to organize workshops and possibly other activities.", 
    "Some expected no more than a scant, bare bones work programme, noting divisions remain too deep to be resolved this week.", 
    "Others were pleased with some very candid and substantive interventions on the work programme during the AWGLCA sessions on Tuesday.", 
    "One delegate hoped that the balance between the scoping of ideas (such as shared vision ), without getting into details could be maintained.", 
    "Some developing country delegates expressed concern that the proposed workshops and other activities outside of the formal AWGLCA meetings would proliferate and hinder full and effective participation of developing countries."
