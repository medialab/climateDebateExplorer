    "On Tuesday, 14 November, this contact group took up the draft decision and annexed draft framework on capacity building in EITs.", 
    "Delegates cleared all of the legal and most of the substantive issues contained in the draft decision as well as the framework for capacity building.", 
    "During this meeting, the US and EU requested that text on the provision of financial and technical support for the implementation of the framework through the 'GEF within its mandate' be bracketed pending the outcome of the contact group on the financial mechanism.", 
    "On Thursday, 16 November, the group revisited the remaining bracketed paragraphs and agreed to remove brackets around reference to Protocol Article 10 (existing commitments) in the preamble.", 
    "However, the group failed to remove brackets around the paragraphs on financial issues and the role of the GEF, and agreed to forward the text as it stood to the subsidiary bodies. During the closing session of the subsidiary bodies on Saturday, 18 November, Co-Chair Uosukainen reported that the contact group had agreed on a framework that sets out the scope and basis for action in EITs, identifies EIT priorities, and outlines responsibilities of EITs in implementing the framework and those of Annex II Parties - industrialized Parties having financial and technology transfer commitments under the UNFCCC - in assisting EITs. In this draft decision (FCCC/CP/2000/CRP.12), the subsidiary bodies recommend that the COP, inter alia, adopt the framework for capacity building in EITs, decide to review the effectiveness of the framework at regular intervals, and urge multilateral and bilateral agencies to coordinate in support of the implementation of the annexed framework.", 
    "It also recommends that the first Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol (COP/MOP-1) adopt a decision endorsing a framework for capacity building under the UNFCCC, that parallels the annexed framework, with additional reference to areas for capacity building relating to the implementation of the Protocol.", 
    "The subsidiary bodies agreed to forward the draft decision and annexed framework to the COP for consideration."
