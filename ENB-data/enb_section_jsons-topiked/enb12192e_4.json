    "COP-6 and the resumed thirteenth sessions of the UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies were held in The Hague, the Netherlands, from 13-25 November 2000.", 
    "During the second week of negotiations, COP-6 President Jan Pronk, Minister of Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment of the Netherlands, attempted to facilitate progress on the many disputed political and technical issues by convening high-level informal Plenary sessions.", 
    "He grouped the issues into the following four 'clusters' or 'boxes': (a) capacity building, technology transfer, adverse effects and guidance to the financial mechanism; (b) mechanisms; (c) LULUCF; and, (d) compliance, policies and measures (P&Ms), and accounting, reporting and review under Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information). However, by Thursday, 23 November, negotiations remained stalled, and President Pronk distributed a Note containing his proposal on key issues in an attempt to encourage a breakthrough.", 
    "After almost 36 hours of intense talks, negotiators could not achieve an agreement, with financial issues, supplementarity in the use of the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF proving particularly difficult.", 
    "On Saturday afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk announced that delegates had failed to reach agreement.", 
    "Delegates agreed to suspend COP-6, and expressed a willingness to resume their work in 2001."
