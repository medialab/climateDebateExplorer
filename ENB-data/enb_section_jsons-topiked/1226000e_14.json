    "The SBSTA was also informed of consultations by the Bureau of the COP on NGO participation.", 
    "They agreed, for SBSTA meetings, to provide constituencies with three seats on the floor; one each for environmental, local authorities and business NGOs.", 
    "The Chair characterized this as a practical approach to the problem.", 
    "Saudi Arabia said that while he respected the decision of the provisional Bureau of the COP, there should be a full discussion on this issue at the next meeting before taking a substantive decision.", 
    "The Chair said this decision was within the mandate of the Bureau, not SBSTA, and noted it did not allow access to the floor, but only three additional seats.", 
    "It noted that this was a 'test phase' limited only to SBSTA."
