    "An infusion of new arrivals for the high-level segment added energy to the corridors on Thursday morning.", 
    "However, some of the enthusiasm seemed to have waned by Thursday evening, at least among those following the plenary discussions.", 
    "The much-anticipated ministerial on a shared vision did not garner as much praise as some had hoped.", 
    "While several participants were buzzing about the strong calls to operationalize the Adaptation Fund, others seemed to find it relatively uninspiring: In spite of the best efforts of the Chair and some others, the discussions seemed a bit flat and repetitive, was the verdict of one delegate.", 
    "Today was still a remarkable networking and relationship-building opportunity, which will be useful when we meet again next year, said one more upbeat observer.", 
    "Meanwhile, security was tight late on Thursday evening around the ministerial group meeting to help finalize agreement on outstanding issues.", 
    "As of 10:30 pm, there was little activity in the corridors, as ministers remained locked in discussions."
