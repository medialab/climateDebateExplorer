    "This issue was first considered by the AWG-KP plenary on 1 June.", 
    "It was then referred to contact group discussions and informal consultations co-chaired by Mama Konate (Mali) and Paul Watkinson (France).", 
    "The AWG-KP closing plenary adopted conclusions on 12 June.", 
    "Discussions took place largely in informal consultations.", 
    "The key issues discussed included: relevant Protocol articles guiding work on potential consequences; vulnerability and the ability to adapt; how to improve understanding of potential consequences; the design of policies and measures to minimize negative consequences of mitigation actions; and implementation.", 
    "On coherence with other negotiating tracks, Australia argued that the group s work should be coherent with work in other UNFCCC processes and that some issues, such as technology transfer, were best left to other processes within and outside the Convention such as the joint SBSTA/SBI contact group on Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures) and Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects and impacts of response measures) .", 
    "The G-77/China stressed the need to refer to actual rather than potential consequences, highlighting that developing countries are already feeling these effects.", 
    "The issue of economic diversification was stressed by Saudi Arabia, who supported its inclusion in the text as a way of mitigating potential consequences.", 
    "The form of the output to be presented at COP 15 also was not decided.", 
    "These issues remained unresolved, and the text was bracketed and annexed to the AWG-KP conclusions."
