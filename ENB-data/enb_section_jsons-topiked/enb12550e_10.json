    "Parties reviewed options and approaches for addressing the gap between the two commitment periods, including: regular ratification; provisional application; unilateral declarations; and CMP decisions.", 
    "Several parties underscored that the approaches are mutually supportive, not exclusive.", 
    "Parties raised concerns over the non-legally binding nature of CMP decisions, while others noted the difficulties and time requirements associated with provisional application.", 
    "Some parties underscored that anything short of provisional application would not be legally binding internationally, and would not address the legal consequences of the gap.", 
    "Some parties said that CMP decisions could help in enabling the Kyoto mechanisms roll over smoothly during the inevitable gap.", 
    "Others underscored that the Kyoto Protocol includes provisions that are independent of the second commitment period."
