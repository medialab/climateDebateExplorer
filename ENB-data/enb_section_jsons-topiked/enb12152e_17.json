    "The use of carbon sinks in meeting emissions targets - which has been considered within discussions on LULUCF - is both complex and controversial.", 
    "Plants and soils can act as carbon sinks, but the science of estimating how much carbon is being removed from the atmosphere is uncertain.", 
    "Including the use of sinks in meeting targets on emissions will require a clear definition of a sink, as well as clarity on what changes are the result of deliberate climate policies.", 
    "Parties must also agree on accounting systems that set the baselines and measure carbon changes.", 
    "Issues of the permanence of carbon storage achieved through forests and other sinks must also be addressed, given that such carbon can be lost due to felling, forest fires and other factors. According to a 'non-paper' published by COP-6 President-designate Jan Pronk on 2 November, delegates will need to determine how reforestation will be defined, including whether to include regeneration after the harvest cycle, what activities should be considered under Protocol Article 3.4 (additional activities), whether such activities should be considered in the first commitment period, and whether the natural uptake of carbon should be separated from direct human-induced effects."
