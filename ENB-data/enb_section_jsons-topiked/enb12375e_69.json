    "This agenda item ( FCCC/SBI/2008/MISC.4 ) was first taken up in plenary on 4 June and then in contact groups and informal consultations chaired by Leon Charles (Grenada).", 
    "The two main issues discussed were: an assessment of the implementation of Convention Article 4.8 (adverse effects and impacts of response measures), decision 5/CP.7 and decision 1/CP.10, to be conducted at COP 14; and the continuation of the implementation of adaptation pending and following the assessment.", 
    "In the contact group, SBI Chair Asadi presented text based on SBI 26 conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2008/L.16), Annex III of document FCCC/SBI/2007/15 (possible elements on adverse effects and impacts of response measures), as well as discussions at SBI 27 and a pre-sessional workshop held in Bonn from 29-30 May 2008.", 
    "Initially, the EU, Russian Federation, AOSIS, LDCs and the G-77/China supported starting discussions based on this text.", 
    "Subsequently, the EU opposed proceeding on this text, preferring to return to discussions on what the priority areas should be.", 
    "The US, supported by Japan and others, expressed preference for basing discussions on Annex III of document FCCC/SBI/2007/15.", 
    "The G-77/China was opposed to returning to general discussions or Annex III, stating that discussions at SBI 27 and the pre-sessional workshop had proceeded beyond these, and that the SBI Chair s text reflected these discussions.", 
    "The G-77/China then presented alternative draft text, as did the Umbrella Group.", 
    "Parties eventually decided to continue more general discussions to identify priority areas.", 
    "The second issue that arose during discussions involved actions to be carried out pending the assessment of implementation.", 
    "Developing countries supported continuing implementing adaptation activities pending the assessment, while developed countries supported waiting for the assessment before deciding, based on the assessment, what further steps to take to implement adaptation.", 
    "Parties ultimately agreed to invite relevant organizations and other stakeholders to participate in implementing possible adaptation activities, which were outlined in a list."
