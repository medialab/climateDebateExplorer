    "Regarding Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects), Chair Dovland noted that the options involve whether or not reporting problems should lead to non-compliance and loss of mechanisms' eligibility.", 
    "Japan, with a number of other Annex I Parties and opposed by the G-77/China, indicated that he did not consider reporting under Article 3.14 to be mandatory, and could not accept a link to mechanisms' eligibility.", 
    "Following completion of negotiations on compliance, and the decision that Article 3.14 questions of implementation are to be addressed by the facilitative branch, Chair Dovland made a proposal regarding all issues related to Article 3.14 whereby reporting problems would not trigger loss of mechanisms' eligibility.", 
    "Japan, Australia and Canada expressed concern with suggested mandatory language on reporting of Article 3.14 implementation.", 
    "Participants were unable to agree on the proposal and the issue was deferred to ministers, who agreed on mandatory reporting requirements not triggering loss of mechanisms' eligibility."
