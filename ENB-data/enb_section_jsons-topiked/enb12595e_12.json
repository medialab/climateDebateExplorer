    "Switzerland, for the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG), called for the meeting to, inter alia : advance common understanding of core elements of the 2015 outcome; advance confidence that all parties will undertake efforts to submit by the first half of 2015 their intended NDCs; advance understanding on information required in order to do this; and unlock opportunities for increasing efforts to reduce emissions before 2020.", 
    "Sudan, for the African Group, called for a clear work plan under both workstreams for all scheduled sessions.", 
    "He emphasized the need for a common understanding of how external processes, including the UN Secretary-General's Climate Summit, will feed into the negotiations, and called for early engagement by parties on all issues.",

    "Highlighting the disproportionate impacts of climate change on small island developing states (SIDS), Nauru, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), stressed that inaction will mean losing the opportunity to avert the worst impacts.", 
    "She called for focusing discussions at this session on: identifying elements to be included in the 2015 agreement and information needed to allow presentation of clear and transparent NDCs; informing a process for urgent submission of parties' proposed NDCs in a transparent and verifiable manner enabling quantification and assessment against the long-term global goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 \u00b0C; and developing a process to review proposed national contributions.",
