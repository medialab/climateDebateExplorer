    "In its decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2009/L.7), the COP/MOP inter alia : adopts the revised JISC rules of procedure, as contained in Annex I to document FCCC/KP/CMP/2009/19 (Part I) and Corr.", 
    "1; encourages the JISC, designated focal points, independent entities, project participants and stakeholders to make every effort to contribute towards a more transparent, consistent, predictable and efficient verification procedure; endorses the revision to the fee structure as recommended by the JISC; notes that income from the charging of fees to cover administrative costs relating to the activities of the JISC will continue to accrue during the biennium 2010-2011 and that income from fees may cover the administrative expenses only as of 2012; notes with concern that the income accrued to date from the charging of fees is significantly lower than the level required to cover the estimated administrative costs relating to JISC activities; requests the JISC to report to COP/MOP 6 on a financial and budget projection up to 2012, including an analysis of when and under which conditions the JISC will become self-financing; and urges Annex I parties to make contributions to the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities for funding the work on JI in the biennium 2010-2011 at a level that would ensure the thorough and timely implementation of the JI management plan."
