    "A number of participants have been commenting on the considerable workload at COP-7, pointing to the numerous issues taken up by the subsidiary bodies and the many informal groups formed to address them, all of which is additional to the remaining work of the negotiating groups on the various draft decisions under the Bonn Agreements.", 
    "While some seemed concerned at the lost opportunity to make significant progress on subsidiary body matters, others said work under the Bonn Agreements must be the priority, especially given the lack of progress so far in the negotiating groups. In other news, rumors were circulating late Wednesday that work was being undertaken on a Marrakesh Declaration for consideration at next year's World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.", 
    "Meanwhile, some delegates were expressing confusion and concerns over the process for deciding the composition of the CDM Executive Board."
