    "SBSTA was established by COP-1 to link: scientific, technical and technological assessments; information provided by competent international bodies; and the policy- oriented needs of the COP.", 
    "At SBSTA-1, held in Geneva from 28-30 August 1995, delegates confronted technically and politically complex issues including: scientific assessments, national communications and AIJ under the pilot phase.", 
    "Among the more contentious issues were definition of SBSTA\u0092s relationship with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the terms of reference and composition of the technical advisory panels on technologies and methodologies (TAPs) and the elaboration of guidelines for national communications from non-Annex I Parties. SBSTA-2, held in Geneva from 27 February-4 March 1996, considered the IPCC\u0092s Second Assessment Report (SAR) and the Technical Advisory Panels (TAPs) and could not yet agree on how to absorb or respond to scientific predictions of climate change.", 
    "Although initial discussions gave the impression that SBSTA-2 would greet the IPCC\u0092s predictions with less resistance than in previous FCCC negotiations, oil producers and other developing countries ultimately blocked consensus on specific conclusions about the SAR.", 
    "Weekend negotiations resulted in a fragile agreement on language defining the divergence of opinion. At SBSTA-3, held from 9-16 July 1996, delegates discussed the SAR and sent an unfinished draft decision with brackets to the COP for resolution.", 
    "Decisions were adopted in conjunction with the SBI on Communications from Annex I Parties and on Communications from non-Annex I Parties.", 
    "Progress was made on a roster of experts and technical panels. SBSTA-4 met from 9-18 December 1996 in Geneva.", 
    "Discussions were complex and often difficult, but delegates confirmed future cooperation with the IPCC and agreed to apply the revised IPCC 1996 guidelines for national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories.", 
    "Delegates also agreed to further work on revisions to the Uniform Reporting Format and methodological issues pertaining to AIJ. At SBSTA-5, which met in Bonn from 25-28 February 1997, delegates considered a number of issues and reached agreement on the Uniform Reporting Format, requested a work plan for an in-depth review of second national communications, and requested a number of reports on technology transfer. SBSTA-6 met from 28 - 7 July 1997, in Bonn.", 
    "Discussions centered on methodological issues, such as methods for inventories and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.", 
    "A joint SBSTA/SBI contact group produced a decision for adoption at COP-3 on the division of labor between the two groups."
