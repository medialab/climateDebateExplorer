AWG-LCA Chair Mukahanana-Sangarwe noted her informal consultations in Tianjin on the Cancun outcome, highlighting a shared desire for a balanced and comprehensive outcome that: respects the two-track approach; balances elements of the Bali Action Plan; is balanced concerning the level of detail; and does not prejudge a future legally-binding outcome.",
