    "During the SBI regular session, several developing country delegations objected to conditionalities placed on GEF project approvals by the GEF Council, stating that all guidelines on GEF projects should come from the COP, not the GEF Council.", 
    "Among the GEF Council guidelines that delegates objected to were requirements that projects be cost-effective and not duplicative.", 
    "Delegates also called for accelerating the project approval process.", 
    "This matter was resolved in a contact group that discussed COP guidance to the GEF Council. The decision adopted by the Plenary (FCCC/CP/1996/L.9) calls on the GEF, as the interim operating financial mechanism of the FCCC, to: implement enabling activities that facilitate capacity building in data collection, consistent with policy guidance, programme priorities and eligibility criteria provided by the COP; provide agreed full incremental costs to implement measures covered by Article 4.1 (commitments under common but differentiated responsibility) in accordance with Article 4.3 (new and additional resources), and to enhance transparency and flexibility; finance full incremental costs only upon request of the interested Party; expedite approval of full agreed costs for preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties; and report on these activities at COP-3."
