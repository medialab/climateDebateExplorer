    "The AR4 was widely found to be most wanting in its abstract treatment of adaptation and lack of depth of regional information.", 
    "Both of these areas fall within the realm of Working Group II (WGII).", 
    "Consequently, the most radical changes proposed to the structure of the Working Groups had to do with changing the distribution of work.", 
    "Whether it was as reflected in a proposal to merge the three Groups into two, with one addressing causes and impacts and the other addressing solutions, or to add a fourth Working Group to share WGII s load, a main concern at IPCC-28 was that more attention had to be paid to the topics covered under WGII.", 
    "Clearly, the topics assigned to WGII, i.e.", 
    "the vulnerability of socioeconomic and natural systems to climate change, negative and positive consequences of climate change, and adaptation options hardly allows for much focus.", 
    "This scope was defined at a time when impacts, vulnerability and adaptation were generally addressed together in the literature.", 
    "However, this approach is increasingly changing, as countries recognize greater urgency to take action to adapt to effects already being perceived.", 
    "With the AR4 clearly stating that some degree of adaptation will be necessary given that the accumulation of greenhouse gases has already committed the earth to a certain level of warming, and with the Bali Action Plan moving adaptation on a par with mitigation, work on adaptation is widely expected to increase exponentially.", 
    "For the same reason, the focus is increasingly moving from the global to regional and local scales, in order to better understand the specific impacts expected and to assess possible adaptation options.", 
    "It is at this scale where adaptation is most likely to be needed, even though defining regions is part of the work required for this effort.", 
    "The request for guidance on available adaptation options signals a move from more theoretical concerns to concrete needs. NOWHERE TO GO BUT DOWN ?", 
    "In the end, though, it was clear that there was no momentum for far-reaching changes, despite the fact that after hitting a high point, as one participant put it, there is nowhere for the IPCC to go but down.", 
    "Agreement was easily reached on the production of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).", 
    "However, much time was devoted to discussing how to adapt the AR5 to the timeline needed for developing key scenario products in order to ensure full use of the new scenarios.", 
    "This resulted in consensus on the necessity to modify the scheduling of Working Group assessment reports so that the WGI report is delivered early enough to allow time for WGII to integrate scenarios into impacts, adaptation and vulnerability studies.", 
    "The fact that the IPCC agreed to revise the assessment cycle in order to make use of the most current scenarios indicates the possibility of improvement in IPCC outputs.", 
    "It is still unclear, however, how the new AR5 cycle will link to the actual policy-making process under the UNFCCC.", 
    "There is a continuing tension, as observed at IPCC-28, between catering to the needs of policy-makers and compromising the ideal of scientific objectivity by allowing policy-makers to delineate the parameters of scientific discussion.", 
    "A shift in focus for the IPCC was manifested at this session: from the hard science on the existence and causes of climate change to the increasing urgency to obtain information on regional impacts, adaptation and mitigation options.", 
    "As Bertrand Russell put it, by way of Yvo de Boer in his opening statement, the goal of science is to formulate a problem in such a way that leads to a solution.", 
    "While the IPCC decided to retain its current structure and continue to conduct comprehensive assessments, it did spend some time thinking about areas where there is room for improvement in order to deliver solutions.", 
    "The need to adapt to a changing climate applies to both the IPCC and the world at large.", 
    "The IPCC recognizes this need to adapt to evolving policy demands, but adaptation and change, even in the face of facts, are a big undertaking, especially when you re doing well."
