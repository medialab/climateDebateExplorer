    "On Tuesday, 8 May, during SBI plenary, Argentina, supported by Brazil, made a statement objecting to the UK's inclusion of Islas Malvinas/Falklands Islands and other South Atlantic islands in its national communications, citing sovereignty disputes.", 
    "The UK responded that it believed itself to be in compliance with its obligations by including these territories in its national communications, and that it would give a more detailed response at a later date.", 
    "Argentina subsequently submitted a short document setting out its position ( FCCC/SBI/2007/MISC.5 ).", 
    "In the closing SBI plenary on 18 May, the UK said it firmly rejects Argentina's objections, has no doubt about its sovereignty over the Falklands Islands, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and surrounding maritime areas, and is respecting the wishes of the Falkland Island people in this regard.", 
    "The SBI did not adopt any conclusions on this matter."
