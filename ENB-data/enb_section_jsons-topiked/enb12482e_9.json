    "In the morning, Co-Chair Buend\u00eda requested parties to focus on options in the text to either create a permanent forum to address potential consequences or use existing channels, such as national communications. ARGENTINA emphasized that establishing a forum is fundamental to address compliance by Annex I parties with their obligations under Protocol Articles 2.3 (adverse impacts of polices and measures) and 3.14 (adverse effects).", 
    "SAUDI ARABIA said the forum is necessary because Annex I parties have not reported on potential consequences in their national communications, while NEW ZEALAND underscored that Annex I parties were not required to report on potential consequences until their fifth national communications, which have just been completed and reviewed.", 
    "In response, SAUDI ARABIA stressed that Annex I parties were obligated to report on potential consequences from their first national communications. SUDAN said the forum would also provide a platform for operationalizing what is reported in national communications.", 
    "NEW ZEALAND noted that information reported in national communications is already operationalized because Annex I parties are reporting on the ways they are implementing their policies to avoid potential consequences.", 
    "On the review function of the proposed forum, she emphasized that the SBI already has a mandate to review national communications. SWITZERLAND underlined that Annex I parties obligation is to strive to minimize impacts of policies and measures and that a process imposing restrictions on how sovereign countries create and implement policies is unadvisable.", 
    "He noted the lack of a clear mandate or terms of reference for the proposed forum."
