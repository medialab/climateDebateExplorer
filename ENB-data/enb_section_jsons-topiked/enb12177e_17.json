    "The approved answer to this question notes that inertia is a widespread and inherent characteristic of the interacting climate, ecological and socioeconomic systems, and thus some impacts of climate change may be slow to become apparent and could be irreversible if thresholds are crossed.", 
    "The answer explains the nature of inertia in climate systems, ecological systems and socioeconomic systems, as well as its policy implications.", 
    "Among other findings, the answer reports that: surface air temperature and sea levels will continue to rise after stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations; inertia makes adaptation inevitable and already necessary in some cases; and anticipatory adaptation and mitigation actions are beneficial, given inertia in the climate system and the possibility of irreversibility.", 
    "The answer includes a graph showing how CO2 concentrations, temperature and sea levels continue to rise long after emissions are reduced."
