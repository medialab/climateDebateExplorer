    "Mixed reactions over the new group on financial issues mandated by COP-6 President Pronk were expressed in the corridors Friday.", 
    "Whereas some welcomed the initiative as a useful move to help focus attention on financial issues, several developing countries expressed concerns at the procedure and problems of timing, given the hectic schedule of informal meetings taking place.", 
    "According to observers, an underlying cause of sensitivity over talks on funding mechanisms lies in differing views over the GEF, with some developing countries pushing for alternative mechanisms.", 
    "They suggest this could be based partly on G-77/China hopes that another mechanism would increase overall funding, an idea apparently rejected by a number of developed country delegates.", 
    "In spite of these differences, however, there seems to be general support for President Pronk's desire to encourage negotiators to focus on funding issues ahead of deliberations by ministers and heads of delegation starting Sunday."
