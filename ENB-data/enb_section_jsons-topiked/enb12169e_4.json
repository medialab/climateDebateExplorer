    "Delegates discussed Principles governing LULUCF activities.", 
    "It was noted that Principles suggested by the G-77/China and others, and appearing in The Hague text, had been integrated into operative paragraphs of the Pronk text.", 
    "Many Parties argued that the Principles should be explicit and form a preamble.", 
    "It was decided that Ministers would be informed that the Principles, as contained in The Hague text, have been widely accepted and should guide their further work. In a discussion on the accounting rules under Article 3.3 contained in Pronk's text, two Annex I Parties questioned the absence of reference to the accounting anomaly related to short rotation forests. The EU presented its proposal on LULUCF activities, which aims at reducing their overall scale by capping Article 3.4 activities and the mechanisms respectively.", 
    "The proposal does not allow LULUCF activities in the CDM, on which several Parties expressed reservations.", 
    "Some Annex I Parties opposed using a discount rate and capping the mechanisms, which they said already are 'heavily constrained.", 
    "' A group of EITs supported a practical compromise based on a negotiated relative limit, representing a percentage of base year emissions, to Article 3.4 activities.", 
    "Parties then briefly commented on the Co-Chairs' Summary from the negotiating group to be presented to Plenary."
