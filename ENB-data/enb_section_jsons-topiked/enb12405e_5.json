    "During informal consultations, parties addressed draft conclusions on the scale of Annex I emission reductions.", 
    "The draft text includes a reference to stabilizing concentrations below 350 ppm, which would require reductions by Annex I countries of at least 45% below 1990 levels by 2020, and at least 95% by 2050.", 
    "The reference was opposed by several parties.", 
    "Differences also remained over whether to include reference to criteria that could support further consideration of the scale of Annex I emission reductions, with some parties preferring to refer to information instead of criteria."
