    "Many conclusions can be derived from a process as rich and complex as the preparation of an IPCC Assessment report.", 
    "A unique feature of IPCC SPMs is how the political negotiation of every line affects a text prepared by scientists, given that scientists and policymakers use different language and come from different professional cultures.", 
    "On this, the experience under the three working groups differs markedly.", 
    "While in WGI the delegates reminded the authors that the SPM needed to have teeth, in WGII the authors were often opposing attempts to water down their findings, and WGIII seemed focused on making the text more understandable to policymakers.", 
    "The outside world certainly showed a lot of interest in the three meetings.", 
    "The press coverage of WGI was extraordinary.", 
    "Throughout the week, members of the media could be found waiting outside the closed-door proceedings, and the press turned out in force when the SPM was released Friday morning.", 
    "While the buzz had somewhat subsided by the time of WGII in Brussels, the story of China's and Saudi Arabia's confrontation with the Lead Authors made the headlines around the world.", 
    "The WGIII meeting also made headlines after the publication of the SPM, but received perhaps less attention than the previous two meetings.", 
    "The contribution of the working groups to international climate policy ends the debate about anthropogenic climate change and paints a striking picture of its impacts.", 
    "It spells out that climate change mitigation is necessary and can be done in a way that does not necessarily prevent economic growth and development.", 
    "Although it remains to be seen how these findings will impact negotiations on the post-2012 period, the draft AR4 pre-empts the argument that more science or more knowledge about technologies or policies are needed, thereby leaving the timely implementation of responses to climate change contingent only on political will.", 
    "In view of the pace of change needed, implementation will require clear determination.", 
    "With a comprehensive scientific package of all three working group reports in their hands, delegates left Bangkok also with some first hand experience of the difficulties that may arise when implementing mitigation policies: despite their clear consensus, and combined and continuing efforts, it proved impossible to warm the air of the UN Conference Center by turning down the frigid air conditioning."
