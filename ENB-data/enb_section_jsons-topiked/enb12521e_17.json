    "Parties agreed that the first and last sessions of each informal group would be open to observers.",

    "Developing countries called for promoting consistency in accounting and comparability of efforts among developed countries through the application of common agreed rules.",

    "Several developed countries supported diverse accounting methodologies to reflect the wide range of methods available to reduce emissions.", 
    "On level of ambition, parties examined options and means to increase commitments and advance work in the lead-up to Durban.", 
    "Some developed countries requested a common space to discuss the level of ambition, which many developing countries opposed, underscoring the different nature and content of the provisions on the level of ambition for developed countries and the provisions on NAMAs for developing countries (paragraphs 48-51 of decision 1/CP.16).", 
    "During the final AWG-LCA contact group meeting on Friday, Co-Facilitator Fern\u00e1ndez Garibaldi reported that the group had developed three non-papers on: possible elements of a draft for biennial reports of developed countries; possible elements of modalities for IAR; and a Co-Facilitators summary of discussion on paragraphs 36-38 (level of ambition).", 
    "On the way forward, parties agreed to set deadlines for submissions and prepare a revised version before Durban."
