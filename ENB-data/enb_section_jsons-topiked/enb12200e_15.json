    "In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.5), the SBSTA decides to recommend to the COP two draft decisions on revisions to the guidelines for the preparation of Annex I national communications, including UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.5/Add.1) and revisions to the UNFCCC guidelines for the technical review of Annex I greenhouse gas inventories under the Convention (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.5/Add.2). The conclusions also: urge Annex I Parties that have not submitted complete inventories, including national inventory reports and common reporting formats, to do so as soon as possible; urge Parties to ensure that experts are made available for the review process from 2003; urge the Secretariat, subject to availability of funding in the current biennium, to supplement funding for the development of a greenhouse gas inventory database, related software and website; and note the need to ensure expertise of experts in the review teams, and decide to consider the treatment of confidential data, jointly with similar items under Protocol Article 8 (review of information) (decision 23/CP.7) at SBSTA-17."
