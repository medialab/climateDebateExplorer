    "An international business NGO used the first briefing for observers to protest the decision to hold negotiations in closed non-groups.", 
    "Business representatives later indicated that they would be discussing the matter with national governments in the hope of reversing the decision in time for AGBM-8 in October.", 
    "While conceding the requirement for closed negotiations in the latter stages of the process, business representatives expressed dismay at the decision to go into closed sessions when negotiating positions of countries are well known. An environmental NGO representative indicated that the AGBM decision on access had been anticipated.", 
    "Nevertheless, there were concerns that a precedent has been set - one that will not go unchallenged when NGOs next meet with the AGBM Chair and Parties.", 
    "To the suggestion that negotiations might advance with more openness in closed sessions, an NGO representative said there had been no evidence of this to date."
