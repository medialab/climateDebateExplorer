    "On 25 February, the Chair noted relationships between cooperation with international organizations and methodological issues and established an informal group on this issue.", 
    "The informal group produced draft recommendations, which noted a JWG recommendation that the IPCC, cooperating with other institutions and the FCCC secretariat, 'should take the lead' on methods for GHG inventories, climate change impacts, and socio-economic cost- benefit analyses.", 
    "The secretariat, in consultation with the IPCC and other relevant organizations, was asked to develop a work programme based on the methodological tasks in document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/20. The issues are: assessing mitigation measures and policies and adaptation options; projecting emissions; evaluating and monitoring the effectiveness of specific policies and measures; assessing mitigation and adaptation technologies; assessing the impact of climate change; and performing a socio-economic cost benefit analysis of adaptation and mitigation options.", 
    "The SBSTA requested Parties to submit information and proposals on methodological activities by 15 April 1997.", 
    "These recommendations were adopted without further discussion."
