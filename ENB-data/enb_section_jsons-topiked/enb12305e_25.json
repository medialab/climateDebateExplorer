    "A sense of relief was apparent among many participants shortly after midnight on Thursday night as the AWG finally completed its work.", 
    "After lengthy informal consultations, AWG Chair Michael Zammit Cutajar successfully steered the first session to a close after a compromise was achieved that included new language on working expeditiously towards agreement on further Annex I commitments.", 
    "Many delegates seemed satisfied at the result, and those not involved in the final small group negotiations that finalized the deal will likely be poring over the document Friday morning.", 
    "According to the late night talk in the corridors, that small group did not include the major non-parties to the Protocol, but did include other big emitters from both Annex I and non-Annex I."
