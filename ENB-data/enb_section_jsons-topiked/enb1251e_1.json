    "AGBM Chair Ra\u00fal Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) stated that negotiations are at an advanced stage and closed sessions were necessary to produce results.", 
    "He also recognized the need to keep intergovernmental and non-governmental observers informed and said morning briefings would be held throughout the week. Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil), Chair of the non-group on QELROS, reported that delegates had been 'extremely cooperative' and refrained from reiterating justifications for their positions.", 
    "The group focused on which greenhouse gases (GHGs) to include in the agreement and whether to adopt a gross or net approach.", 
    "On coverage, he said consensus is likely for including a list of gases and expressed hope that discussions would produce a well- defined mechanism for adding more gases in the future.", 
    "On whether to adopt a gross or net approach, he said the group would submit alternatives with and without carbon sinks.", 
    "He said the group would next consider units of emission, mass per year and how to weight the contributions of each gas to climate change. Evans King (Trinidad and Tobago), Chair of the non-group on Article 4.1, reported that the group had begun by considering material in clusters and reorganizing material in the chapeau, which refers to advancing the implementation of commitments and the Berlin Mandate.", 
    "He said a solid foundation had been laid for work on the text, and he would propose that the group complete a first reading of the section to streamline the text. Takao Shibata, Chair of the non-group on institutions, mechanisms and final clauses expressed hope that his group could build agreement on the issues that are somewhat peripheral to the core issues under debate.", 
    "A representative from the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) protested the exclusion of NGOs from the non-group sessions."
