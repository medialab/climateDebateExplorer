    "The twin decisions to convene COP-6 in the year 2000 (rather than delay it until 2001) and intensify the work programme during the intersessional period will help to set a lively pace for negotiations on outstanding issues and sharpen the focus of debates.", 
    "Additional subsidiary body meetings and intensive high- level exchanges will be reminiscent of those that characterized the period leading up to Kyoto. The NGO campaign calling for the Protocol's entry into force by the tenth anniversary of the Earth Summit in 2002 has also taken hold.", 
    "The NGO community plays a central role in the negotiations, working for transparency and rigor in the process and providing a 'user friendly' point of access for civil society.", 
    "A sharper focus for NGO work will be provided by a call for a European Leadership initiative launched by Hermann Ott (Wuppertal Institute) and Sebastian Oberth\u00far (Ecologic) at COP-5, calling for an EU and Japanese-led coalition to achieve early entry into force of the Protocol.", 
    "NGOs have also worked hard to encourage Parties to exclude the nuclear option from consideration under the JI and CDM mechanisms."
