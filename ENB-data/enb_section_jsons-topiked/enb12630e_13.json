    "In the afternoon, the first session of the 3rd Dialogue on Article 6 (education, training and public awareness) focused on climate change education and international cooperation.", 
    "SBI Chair Yauvoli opened the event, stressing the importance of educating citizens who make responsible decisions and empowering people as agents of change. Noting that not one human endeavor will be unaffected by climate change, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres called for integrating this \u201cnew reality\u201d into the \u201cDNA of education.\u201d She also requested renaming \u201cArticle 6\u201d in a way that \u201cmakes sense,\u201d inviting suggestions by all. Stressing that Article 6 is fundamental for preparing societies for the transition ahead, co-facilitator Katarzyna Snyder (Poland) suggested the Lima Ministerial Declaration on Education and Awareness-Raising highlights the importance of the issue at hand. Presentations covered topics such as human psychology and climate change, and advancing climate change education through the Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.", 
    "Participants also heard presentations on good practices and lessons learned on climate change education, and engaged in break-out working groups on key topics related to climate change education."
