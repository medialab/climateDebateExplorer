    "Delegates considered procedures and mechanisms relating to a compliance system under the Protocol in informal meetings during the pre-sessional week, in joint SBI/SBSTA meetings on Monday and Friday, 12 and 16 June, and in the Joint Working Group on Compliance (JWG) from 13-15 June. On Wednesday, 7 June, delegates to the informal meetings on compliance heard a brief report by Harald Dovland (Norway), Co-Chair of the JWG, on the compliance workshop held in Bonn from 1-3 March.", 
    "Co-Chair Tuiloma Neroni Slade (Samoa) introduced the Co-Chairs' Elements of a Compliance System for the Kyoto Protocol, which was based on Parties' submissions and discussions during the workshop and informal consultations held in Montreux in February.", 
    "He noted that this would serve as a basis for the week's discussions.", 
    "Delegates discussed the Co-Chairs' Elements in informal meetings held on 7-9 June. On Monday, 12 June, Co-Chair Slade reported to the Joint SBI/SBSTA on the workshop held from 1-3 March and the informal meetings preceding SB-12.", 
    "He said that these, together with further submissions from Parties, had formed the basis for the elaboration of a Co-Chairs' Text to be considered by the JWG. The JWG met on Tuesday and Wednesday, 13-14 June, to consider the Co-Chairs' text composed of a main section and three annexes containing procedural arrangements.", 
    "A number of delegates supported the text as a basis for their work.", 
    "The EU, US, Switzerland and Samoa said some elements in the annexes may need to be included in the main part of the text.", 
    "The G-77/China said binding consequences would only apply to Annex I Parties.", 
    "On the title of the text, the US favored a reference to 'procedures and mechanisms related to compliance under the Kyoto Protocol,' since there are other provisions in the Protocol dealing with compliance.", 
    "The EU preferred 'a compliance system for the Kyoto Protocol' in order to reflect a comprehensive approach to dealing with compliance. On Objective, a number of delegates supported the inclusion of 'enforcing' compliance.", 
    "Saudi Arabia sought a reference to compliance with obligations contained in Protocol Articles 2 (P&Ms) and 3 (targets).", 
    "Australia suggested the compliance system focus on both Articles 3.1 and 4.1 (joint fulfillment).", 
    "The EU favored a general reference to the Party's 'obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "' On Nature, Australia, the EU, the Russian Federation and the US preferred no express provision.", 
    "On Principles, Australia, the Russian Federation, the US, Japan and New Zealand preferred not expressly providing for these in the text. On Scope of Application, Canada, supported by the US, suggested specifying that the system would apply to all Protocol commitments/obligations 'as provided in this decision,' since the accompanying decision would specify variations in the treatment of Protocol provisions.", 
    "China, supported by Saudi Arabia, sought listing the Annex I Parties' commitments to which the compliance system would apply, and said compliance with other commitments would be dealt with under the Multilateral Consultative Process.", 
    "Argentina said the compliance system should cover both Annex I and non-Annex I obligations.", 
    "Chile added that the special nature of non-Annex I obligations required that issues of compliance be dealt with through facilitation. On the Establishment, Structure and Functions of the compliance system, the US and Australia, opposed by New Zealand and the EU, said the text should emphasize the two- branch structure of the compliance body.", 
    "On Establishment, Canada, with the Russian Federation and Chile, said the facilitative branch would not adopt 'decisions.", 
    "' China suggested specifying that compulsory measures would not apply to non-Annex I Parties.", 
    "Delegates also made several specific suggestions on the mandate of the enforcement branch.", 
    "The EU said any reference to Article 4 (joint fulfillment) should be bracketed. On the Structure of the compliance body, the Russian Federation expressed doubts about having an elective compliance body, as this would not guarantee that his country would have a place on it, although it represented a high share of the current level of emissions.", 
    "Saudi Arabia, with Samoa, suggested that the election of members be based on 'equal representation of the five UN regional groups.", 
    "' New Zealand sought greater representation of Annex I Parties given their more significant obligations. On the Functions of the compliance body, the G-77/China, with Saudi Arabia and Samoa, opposed a screening function.", 
    "The US stressed that mandatory outcomes would apply automatically. On the Submission of Questions to the compliance body, Brazil suggested that 'a body of representatives established by the COP/MOP' also be able to submit questions.", 
    "China, Japan and Chile stressed the importance of Article 8 ERT reports, while Australia said these should be the only way for the process to be triggered.", 
    "Saudi Arabia, opposed by New Zealand, supported a role for the COP/MOP.", 
    "The US proposed that Parties be able to raise questions regarding another Party's implementation only with respect to the facilitative branch.", 
    "The EU proposed that the Secretariat also be able to refer questions of compliance.", 
    "On the Preliminary Examination of Questions, Saudi Arabia suggested that if multiple cases arise on the same type of issues the matter should be referred to the Subsidiary Bodies. On Proceedings, several delegates stressed the importance of integrating elements of the annexes in the main text.", 
    "On Decision-Making, Saudi Arabia said decisions would be adopted by consensus, and in case of failure, by a three- fourths majority vote.", 
    "On Participation of Parties, the G-77/China said the Party concerned could comment on any information used by the compliance body as a basis for its deliberation.", 
    "On Avoidance of Conflict of Interest, China proposed that the member of the compliance body who is a national of a Party involved in a matter should not take part in 'the consideration of the matter.", 
    "' Canada added that this includes members having a direct or indirect interest in the matter.", 
    "On Sources of Information, the G-77/China, with the Russian Federation, opposed by New Zealand, suggested distinguishing between mandatory and non-mandatory sources.", 
    "The US, with New Zealand, suggested the possibility for NGOs to submit information.", 
    "The Russian Federation, the US and AOSIS said the issue of confidentiality of information might conflict with the principle of transparency and needed further thought. On the COP/MOP, Switzerland, with New Zealand, said it would only 'take note' of the reports of the compliance body.", 
    "On Outcomes and Consequences, Saudi Arabia, with China, said that every reference to 'Party,' with respect to eligibility requirements, should be prefaced by 'Annex I.", 
    "' He added that any reference to Article 12 (CDM) should be bracketed since this mechanism does not fall under the scope of application of the compliance system.", 
    "Brazil, Samoa and the EU suggested framing 'financial penalty' as a separate option.", 
    "New Zealand introduced an option permitting purchase at a penalty rate, inter alia, from future commitment periods.", 
    "Australia suggested adding that if an Article 4 (joint fulfillment) Party becomes ineligible to use the mechanisms, all other members of the agreement would lose access to the mechanisms.", 
    "On Other Provisions, the G-77/China suggested requesting the Secretariat to prepare possible options for the adoption of procedures and mechanisms related to compliance.
