    "The headline message to this section states that human influence on the climate system is clear as it is evident from the increasing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the climate system.", 
    "The text notes that climate models have improved since AR4.", 
    "It also says that human influence has been detected in: warming of the atmosphere and the ocean; changes in the global water cycle; reductions in snow and ice; global mean sea level rise; and changes in some climate extremes.", 
    "According to the report, the 'evidence for human influence has grown since AR4' and 'it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century', with extremely likely referring to a 95 - 100% probability."
