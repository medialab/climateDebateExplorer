    "She noted the input of non-papers, submissions by parties (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/MISC.8) and advice from the Secretary-General s High-Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/MISC.8/Add.1).", 
    "Mukahanana-Sangarwe then requested the AWG-LCA to forward the draft decision (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/L.7), prepared under the COP President s responsibility, to the COP for its consideration.", 
    "Bolivia opposed this, stating that the text does not reflect converging opinions.", 
    "On a shared vision, he rejected a 2\u00b0C goal as totally inadequate.", 
    "He said he could not agree to a decision without knowing what Annex I countries commitments would be, noting the assumption that the list would come from the Copenhagen Accord and thus not meet the 2\u00b0C objective.",

    "He reiterated the lack of consensus on the draft decision and Bolivia s rejection of it.", 
    "Guatemala stressed the need to stop talking and start taking decisions.", 
    "Colombia questioned how not having any agreement could be beneficial for the environment and, supported by Gabon, noted that consensus did not mean that one country could block decisions.", 
    "Mukahanana-Sangarwe pointed to an apparent willingness in the room to forward the draft report of the session (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/L.7) for consideration to the COP, which parties, except for Bolivia, agreed to.", 
    "Bolivia stated that the report may have been forwarded by the AWG-LCA to the COP but that there was no consensus to do so.", 
    "Chair Mukahanana-Sangarwe encouraged delegates to continue to strive to do better and expressed appreciation to delegates for their support and confidence in her leadership.",
