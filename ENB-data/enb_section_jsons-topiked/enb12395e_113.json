    "The agenda in Pozna\u00c5\u0084 was exceptionally full, with six bodies considering more than 90 agenda items and sub-items.", 
    "This put a strain on many delegations and highlighted the importance of prioritizing work.", 
    "This meant that some of the less urgent agenda items were not given as much attention as usual, leading to a focus on issues related to the Bali Roadmap: the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action (AWG-LCA), Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments by Annex I Countries under the Protocol (AWG-KP) and the second review of the Kyoto Protocol under Article 9.", 
    "Delegates also focused on a few other agenda items included the operationalization of the Adaptation Fund and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)."
