    "In its conclusions (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/L.4), the AWG-KP requests the Secretariat to, inter alia : organize an in-session workshop during AWG-KP 13, on Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions, which should include discussions exploring a possible enhanced scale of emission reductions; organize a pre-sessional workshop before AWG-KP 13 on forest management accounting; and prepare a paper identifying and exploring legal options, aimed at ensuring that there is no gap between the first and subsequent commitment periods, as well as the legal consequences and implications of a possible gap.", 
    "The AWG-KP also requests parties to submit: proposals to address the implications of the other issues for Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions; available new data and information on their expected use in the next commitment period, of LULUCF, the flexibility mechanisms, the expected carryover of AAUs and related assumptions; and views on proposed Protocol amendments under Article 3.9 (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/6/Add.1), with a view to facilitating the updating of the document at least two weeks before AWG-KP 14."
