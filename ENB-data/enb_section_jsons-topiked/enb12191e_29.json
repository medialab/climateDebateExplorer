    "Florin Vladu, Programme Officer, Technology, UNFCCC Secretariat, spoke about the dissemination of technology needs information through 'TT:Clear,' a programme proposed by the UNFCCC that aims to improve the flow of, and access to, information related to the development and transfer of ESTs.", 
    "He explained that a prototype has been up-and-running since September 2001, and that 1650 projects are now in the UNFCCC\u0092s database, with users being able to access information by using search criteria.", 
    "He also noted that TT:Clear would act as a gateway to information from outside sources. Li Junfeng, Deputy Director General, Energy Research Institute, China, examined the role of the UNFCCC\u0092s Technology Website, identifying who needs the website, what kind of information they require, what can be achieved from the website, the role of the website, and how it can be developed so that it meets visitors\u0092 needs.", 
    "He indicated that the primary users would be decision makers, manufacturers, investors, and research and development institutions, and said it would supply information on relevant policies, technologies and investment opportunities, and would seek to act as a bridge between those supplying and demanding technologies."
