    "The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, took place from 7-19 December 2009.", 
    "It included: COP 15 and COP/MOP 5, held in conjunction with the 31st sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies, as well as AWG-KP 10 and AWG-LCA 8.", 
    "What many characterized as intense negotiations took place over the two weeks at the level of experts, Ministers and Heads of State.", 
    "Over 110 world leaders attended the joint COP and COP/MOP high-level segment from 16-18 December.", 
    "Questions concerning transparency and process played out during the meeting.", 
    "Differences emerged, inter alia , on whether work should be carried out in a smaller Friends of the Chair format or in open contact groups.", 
    "A proposal by the Danish COP Presidency to table two texts reflecting the work done by the AWGs also caused divisions.", 
    "Many parties rejected this idea, urging that only texts developed in the AWGs by parties should be used.", 
    "During the high-level segment, informal negotiations took place in a group consisting of major economies and representatives of regional and other negotiating groups.", 
    "Late on Friday evening, these talks resulted in a political agreement entitled the Copenhagen Accord.", 
    "During the closing COP plenary, which lasted nearly 13 hours, discussions ensued on the transparency of the process and on whether the COP should adopt the Copenhagen Accord.", 
    "Most negotiating groups supported its adoption as a COP decision in order to operationalize it as a step towards a better future agreement.", 
    "Some developing countries, however, opposed the Accord reached during what they characterized as an untransparent and undemocratic negotiating process.", 
    "Ultimately, parties agreed to adopt a COP decision whereby the COP takes note of the Copenhagen Accord.", 
    "Parties also established a procedure for countries supporting the Copenhagen Accord to accede to it.", 
    "By May 2010, 130 countries indicated their support for the Copenhagen Accord.", 
    "Forty-two Annex I countries and 37 non-Annex I countries have also provided information on their emission reduction targets and other mitigation actions, as agreed under the Accord.", 
    "On the last day of the Copenhagen Climate Conference, the COP and COP/MOP also agreed to extend the mandates of the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP, requesting them to present their respective outcomes to COP 16 and COP/MOP 6, which will convene in Canc\u00fan, Mexico for two weeks beginning on 29 November 2010."
