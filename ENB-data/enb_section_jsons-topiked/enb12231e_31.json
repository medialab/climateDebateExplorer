    "In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.18), SBSTA, inter alia: endorses the programme of work of the EGTT for 2004; notes that full implementation of the EGTT programme of work for 2004 would require additional supplementary resources; encourages Parties to include more specific reporting on capacity-building activities relating to technology transfer in their national communications and promote and support technology networks and partnerships that complement technology transfer, training, and capacity-building activities; and invites UNDP and others to provide information to the EGTT on implementation of technology needs assessments and technology transfer capacity-building activities. SBSTA also requests the Secretariat, subject to the availability of resources, to organize a workshop on innovative options for financing the development and transfer of technology."
