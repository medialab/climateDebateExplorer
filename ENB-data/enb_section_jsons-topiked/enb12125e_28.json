    "On 14 March, Tariq Banuri, Senior Research Director, Tellus Institute, discussed climate change policy within the framework of sustainable development.", 
    "Noting that 40% of the world's population lives in poverty, he said the challenge is to achieve development in the context of reducing global carbon emissions. He outlined the concept of 'sustainable livelihoods,' which considers development objectives in terms of identifying vulnerabilities and establishing sufficient capacities in developing countries.", 
    "He said the capacity for sustainable development is determined by the availability of various types of capital, including financial, technological, ecological, social, institutional, cultural and climate capital.", 
    "He noted that climate is a form of capital that is shrinking on a global level.", 
    "However, developing institutional capital can help create the necessary technological and financial capital to achieve sustainable development. He said climate-related actions to promote sustainable development should include: a focus on the 'sustainable livelihoods' approach; a transition to renewable forms of energy; capacity building for project certification, monitoring and preparation, and self-protection, research and policy making; a gradualist rather than 'sudden change' approach; and the development of national adaptation funds. Philip Gwage, Assistant Commissioner, Applied Meteorology and Data Processing, Ministry of Land, Water and Environment of Uganda, considered the impacts of response measures on LDCs.", 
    "He said LDCs were particularly vulnerable to climate change and its response measures, given their economic fragility and high levels of poverty.", 
    "He said response measures may result in: declining exports from LDCs to developed countries; increasing prices of essential goods in LDCs, especially if oil prices are high; an increasing debt burden; and decreasing development assistance, which may not be offset by foreign direct investment, as investment conditions are often less attractive in LDCs than in other developing countries.", 
    "He called for: studies specifically relating to the impact of climate change and response measures on LDCs; and elimination of market imperfections relating to oil and other commodities. In the ensuing discussion, several countries noted the adverse impact of high energy prices on LDCs.", 
    "The NETHERLANDS said he understood that the impact of response measures on non-annex I energy importers would be positive or neutral overall.", 
    "JAPAN observed that oil prices have been rising regardless of FCCC- related measures.", 
    "He noted the adverse impact of oil price rises on LDCs, and asked who is gaining from these increases.", 
    "Bo Kjellen (Sweden), who chaired this session, noted that commodity prices have a history of price fluctuations.", 
    "SAUDI ARABIA noted market distortions, and said tax made up 80% of the final price of oil in some OECD countries.", 
    "He said all developing countries will be affected by climate change or response measures. UNSIDS supported allowing only renewable energy within the CDM.", 
    "IRAN said renewable energy sources have only a limited capacity to compensate for conventional sources.", 
    "In response, Banuri said there must be a shift in the long term to renewable sources.", 
    "Replying to a question from BURKINA FASO on compensation, Banuri said he did not believe that large financial transfers provided long-term benefits.", 
    "He stressed the need for investment in capacity rather than compensation.", 
    "FRANCE called for more work on the transportation sector, as it is critical in terms of energy use."
