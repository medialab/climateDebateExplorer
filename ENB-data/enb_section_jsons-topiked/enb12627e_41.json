    "The first IPCC session after the adoption of an Assessment Report is usually far less taxing, straightforward and relatively uneventful.", 
    "Yet as IPCC-41 was about to get underway, the Panel received news of the resignation of IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri.", 
    "The official start of the session was postponed for two hours to allow for the IPCC Bureau to meet in order to determine how best to address the situation.", 
    "In the end, however, work proceeded as planned and IPCC-41 concluded on time.", 
    "The Panel went over the recommendations prepared by the Task Group on the Future of the IPCC and took a series of decisions, laying the foundation for its work for the next seven years.", 
    "While these decisions do not represent a radical departure from past practice, the Panel did insert a degree of flexibility and openness to the AR6 process in taking some of the decisions.", 
    "The fact that the meeting did not get bogged down on procedural matters, despite the extraordinary circumstances of Pachauri s resignation, illustrates the IPCC s strength and resilience as an organization, and its ability to remain focused on and committed to the issues at hand.", 
    "What follows is a short analysis of IPCC-41, focusing on the key outcomes and decisions taken in Nairobi and what they might mean for the future once a new Bureau is elected and scoping sessions begin."
