    "SBI Chair Becker chaired this contact group meeting, presented draft SBI conclusions and COP 11/MOP 1 decisions, and proposed two revisions: that full-cost funding from the LDC Fund shall be to meet the 'agreed' costs of activities to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change as identified and prioritized in the NAPAs; and that adaptation to climate change is the reason for such funding rather than the 'sole' reason.", 
    "Uganda, for LDCs, noted that it could agree to 'additional' instead of 'agreed,' and proposed deleting reference to adaptation as the reason for such funding.", 
    "The EU, CANADA, and others offered support for the Chair\u0092s proposals.", 
    "Lacking agreement, the Chair adjourned the contact group.", 
    "However, informal consultations eventually produced a compromise that includes a footnote defining 'additional costs' and deleting the reference to adaptation to climate change as the reason for such funding."
