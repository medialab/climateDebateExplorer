    "In the decision (FCCC/2003/CP/L.3), the COP notes that: aggregate greenhouse gas emissions of Annex I Parties in 2000 were below their 1990 levels largely because of decreases in EIT emissions; emissions in energy and transport sectors had increased in 2000 above 1990 levels; and emissions from international civil aviation had increased more than 40% in the period 1990-2000.", 
    "The COP concludes that further action is needed by Annex I Parties to implement P&Ms that will contribute to modifying longer-term trends in anthropogenic emissions and urges these Parties to intensify their efforts in this regard.", 
    "The COP urges those Annex I Parties that have not submitted their national communications or their annual greenhouse gas inventories to do so as a matter of priority. In addition, the COP stresses the need for Parties included in Annex II to the UNFCCC to provide detailed information on their assistance to developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects.", 
    "It encourages SBSTA to consider ways of improving the transparency of greenhouse gas projections in time to contribute to the preparation of fourth national communications."
