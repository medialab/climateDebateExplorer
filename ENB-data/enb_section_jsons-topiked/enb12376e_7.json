    "DEVELOPMENT OF METHODOLOGIES FOR REDD The session addressed the development of methodologies specific for REDD, including establishing reference emission levels, scale of implementation (national and subnational approaches), implications and guidance.", 
    "Gabon spoke on forests in the Congo Basin countries, saying they have the lowest rate of deforestation and degradation but that the challenge is to maintain this state of affairs given evidence of the beginning of fragmentation in the forests.", 
    "Noting linkages between deforestation and degradation in the region, he cautioned that these cannot be treated separately and highlighted growing pressure on the forest as a result of the impacts of climate change and desertification.", 
    "He pointed to the great increase in logging permits in the Congo Basin, but noted that many of these permits are increasingly for SFM.", 
    "Warning that the Congo Basin could go the way of West Africa, he underscored the need to value standing forests.", 
    "Indonesia reported on a national REDD study and stakeholder consultations to address relevant issues and methodologies.", 
    "He noted Indonesia s commitment to: stop illegal logging; suspend permits for palm oil plantations on peatland; address land rehabilitation; and provide incentives for local governments that maintain and rehabilitate land and forest cover.", 
    "He also highlighted land use mapping exercises carried out from 1985 - 2003 with ongoing monitoring, but said neither these nor studies of area change are yet sufficient to establish REDD reference emissions levels.", 
    "He also noted the existence of a forest plot network but said there is little to no data on carbon stocks.", 
    "He stated that Indonesia faces challenges on data availability, including a lack of data on historical carbon stocks, and on matching existing monitoring systems to REDD requirements.", 
    "Noting the loss of almost 82% of forest land coverage since the mid-twentieth century and a present deforestation rate of 180,000 ha/yr, Paraguay elaborated on his country s attempts to address the situation, including through: a non-deforestation law; an environmental service law; and an innovative mechanism whereby those who do not conserve the required 25% of forest in their lands must compensate others who preserve more than 25%.", 
    "He stressed links between REDD and greenhouse gas inventories in national communications, and said his country s experience is suitable as a subnational first step towards a national approach, for which greater capacity is needed.", 
    "As constraints, he identified technical capacity and financing as well as legal aspects, given that 95% of the land is privately owned.", 
    "Papua New Guinea highlighted its experiences with REDD, noting the need for political leadership and clear objectives.", 
    "One speaker reported on the country s phase one REDD readiness approach, beginning with forests and agriculture, and its desire for phase two early actions in order to be ready for the post-2012 era.", 
    "He said that in Papua New Guinea s experience the basic data is available, sometimes in surprising places, and can be cost-effective and IPCC-compliant.", 
    "He called for policy discussions to consider national circumstances and for consistent revenue streams for developing countries.", 
    "Another speaker noted difficulty in projecting the future using different data sets.", 
    "He explained that Papua New Guinea is testing methodologies for reference scenarios and has found that deforestation is less of a problem methodologically than is degradation, although both can use the same data set.", 
    "He confirmed their use of the indirect approach from the GOFC-GOLD Sourcebook and a plot sampling system for the years 1990 and 2000 but said the wall-to-wall approach will be used when appropriate satellite data becomes available.", 
    "Mexico reported on national REDD preparations.", 
    "He noted various sources of information, including land use and land cover maps, satellite imagery, forest inventory data which is currently forest-based but will include carbon stock data beginning in 2009, and auxiliary data.", 
    "He acknowledged that estimated deforestation between 2003 and 2006 was about 350,000 ha/year, and said drivers of deforestation and degradation include illegal logging, forest fires and pests, authorized land use changes, roads, settlements and population density, and stated that a vulnerability map had been developed to identify forests under threat.", 
    "He said Mexico considers forestry and climate change as national security issues and is committed to a zero deforestation target.", 
    "He highlighted government programs to reduce deforestation and degradation including payments for environmental services, sustainable forest management, sustainable community forestry, and soil conservation and restoration.", 
    "Costa Rica recounted its efforts to recover forest cover through various legal and institutional measures, including through a Payment for Environmental Services programme, a consolidated system of protected areas, a ban on land use change, reforestation programmes, enhancement of ecotourism, and national strategies to combat illegal logging.", 
    "As challenges to maintaining carbon stocks he highlighted the operational costs of the protected areas system and other programmes, and the increasing land opportunity costs given demand for timber and biofuels, noting these considerations should be taken into account in any future system on REDD.", 
    "He stressed monitoring as a strong pillar of any programme and said the risks of leakage are greatly reduced by a comprehensive approach.", 
    "On reference levels, he supported a flexible approach according to national circumstances and said the baseline must recognize risks and pressures related to maintaining carbon stocks noting a national approach should prevail.", 
    "He cautioned against striving for inordinately costly data for accuracy s sake and noted the need for international sources of funding.", 
    "Tuvalu presented on issues associated with international emissions displacement.", 
    "He pointed to modeling studies on forest conservation, which suggest that under current trade conditions, estimated emissions displacement ranges from 45% to 90%, with an average of 70% for most regions.", 
    "He highlighted the timber trade as a driver, along with production of other commodities such as oil palm, beef and veal, and soy.", 
    "He said policy to address international emissions displacement could include an all in approach to allow all tropical forest countries to build capabilities for national forest inventories and the necessary policy and legal frameworks to manage their forests on a sustainable basis; tackling illegal logging and trade; and/or creating disincentives for importing REDD-unfriendly forest products, such as through carbon deficit levies as the opposite of carbon credits.", 
    "Japan elaborated on his country s initiatives on SFM and their applicability to REDD activities, including Japan s contributions to the World Bank s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), workshops on forest fires as an element of REDD, and the Japan-Asia REDD seminar for capacity building for REDD readiness.", 
    "He identified three key problems: limited human, infrastructural and financial resources; the numerous causes and stakeholders involved; and difficulties in institutionalizing and scaling-up a model area into a national programme.", 
    "He stressed coordination and consultation among multiple sectors and stakeholders and the need to synthesize the various benefits from forests."
