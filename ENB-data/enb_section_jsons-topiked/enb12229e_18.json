    "On the sixth anniversary of the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, frustration over lack of progress was clear.", 
    "Convening in a late night Plenary to adopt SBI conclusions, Parties continued to deliberate on issues not agreed to during the contact groups and informal consultations.", 
    "Observers noted that while the sinks in the CDM issue, which was generally expected to cause the greatest troubles at COP-9, had been resolved, the controversy of the developing country issues had been underestimated.", 
    "This was evident both in the heated debates around the SCCF, referred to by one delegate as 'opening Pandora\u0092s Box,' and in consideration of non-Annex I national communications.", 
    "Several shaken delegates said the EU\u0092s lack of resistance over deferring consideration of submission of second and, where appropriate, third national communications to SB-20 was wholly out of line with the EU\u0092s negotiating mandate.", 
    "The surprise was equally evident among some developing country delegates, who met this give-away of bargaining power with concealed laughter of disbelief."
