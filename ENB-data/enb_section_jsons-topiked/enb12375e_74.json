    "Capacity building under the Convention ( FCCC/SBI/2008/6 ) was first considered in plenary on 4 June.", 
    "The main focus of this agenda item was the second comprehensive review of the implementation of the capacity-building framework (decision 2/CP.7), which was mandated by decision 2/CP.10 (capacity building for developing countries) for initial consideration at SBI 28 and completion at COP 15.", 
    "The issue of performance indicators to monitor the implementation of capacity building was discussed during contact groups and informal consultations co-chaired by Crispin d Auvergne (Saint Lucia) and Helmut Hojesky (Austria).", 
    "The group s task was primarily to develop the terms of reference for the review.", 
    "The EU, supported by other Annex I parties, opposed the development and use of performance indicators for the review, stating that this could pre-empt the outcomes of a workshop to be held this summer, and a technical paper to be prepared by the Secretariat.", 
    "The group agreed to wait for the outcomes of the workshop, technical paper and comprehensive review before deciding on further steps necessary to regularly monitor and evaluate capacity building, which could include the development and use of performance indicators.", 
    "The group also agreed on the terms of reference for the review, which outline the objectives, principles, information sources and expected outcomes of the review."
