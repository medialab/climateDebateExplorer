    "Discussions covered the agenda items on Annex I countries aggregate and individual emission reductions.", 
    "They were taken up by the AWG-KP plenary on Monday, 30 March, and considered in a contact group and informal consultations chaired by Chair Dovland.", 
    "The AWG-KP closing plenary adopted the conclusions ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/L.6 ) on Wednesday, 8 April.",

    "She called for Annex I countries, whether or not they are Protocol parties, to collectively reduce their emissions by at least 45% from 1990 levels by 2020, and by more than 95% by 2050.", 
    "Later in the session, the LDCs and the African Group expressed support for this position, while some non-Annex I countries expressed other views.", 
    "India, for example, called for an overall emission reduction target for all Annex I countries of 40% from 1990 levels.", 
    "The EU proposed an Annex I aggregate emission reduction range of 30% by 2020.",

    "Norway reiterated the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030.", 
    "Australia and New Zealand supported stabilization at 450 ppm.",

    "Belarus stressed the need to include his country in Annex B and ratify the Belarus amendment for it to enter into force.", 
    "Japan and the Russian Federation highlighted their ongoing domestic processes on further emission reductions.", 
    "Japan said his country would announce a mid-term target in June and supported halving global emissions by 2050.", 
    "Questioning the 25-40% aggregate range for Annex I countries from the IPCC AR4, Japan stressed several possible emission pathways to achieve a given stabilization level and the need to consider political and economic factors.", 
    "China and Japan emphasized that the AR4 is not a negotiated outcome.", 
    "Expressing disappointment at the failure of many Annex I parties to present concrete numbers, Tuvalu drew attention to the AWG-KP as a faith-building exercise, which would allow action under the AWG-LCA.", 
    "New Zealand called for agreement on a shared vision and a global goal under the AWG-LCA before finalizing commitments under the AWG-KP.", 
    "India proposed that the AWG-LCA should agree on the collective emission reductions range for all Annex I parties and decide on individual targets for Protocol non-parties, while the AWG-KP should focus on targets for Protocol parties.", 
    "Japan and the Russian Federation, opposed by several developing countries, urged inserting a reference to cooperation with the AWG-LCA in the conclusions.",

    "South Africa and several other developing countries urged a clear and strong signal concerning the AWG-KP s work on Annex I countries further emission reductions.", 
    "After informal consultations conducted by Ian Fry (Tuvalu), parties reached agreement on Wednesday evening on the need to add text, which, inter alia, notes information provided by some parties on scientific findings since AR4, and indicates that the scale of emission reductions will be the key focus of AWG-KP 8.", 
    "On the possible ways forward to determine the aggregate emission reduction range, parties agreed to the EU s proposal to compile the existing pledges by Annex I parties, which were incorporated in an informal table compiled by the Secretariat.", 
    "Many proposals on the aggregate range were reiterated in the contact group on legal matters and included as bracketed options in the Chair s non-paper on possible Protocol amendments under Article 3.9, which many expect will evolve into a negotiating text at the June session.",
