    "He highlighted a significant increase in the number of adaptation projects financed and national implementating entities accredited.", 
    "He further noted a drop in the price of CERs, observing that this could jeopardize the Fund s existence.", 
    "He urged Annex I parties to make financial contributions to avoid compromising the Fund s capacity to meet the needs of vulnerable countries. JAMAICA, supported by SUDAN, the PHILIPPINES, VANUATU and ZAMBIA, called on the CMP to facilitate mobilization of additional funds during CMP 8.", 
    "Pointing to the limitations of the carbon market, BURKINA FASO suggested exploring ways to institutionalize predictable funding sources.",

    "He suggested allocating a share of the proceeds from Joint Implementation (JI) and emissions trading to the Adaptation Fund.", 
    "Noting that CERs are an important source for the Fund, NEW ZEALAND encouraged parties to take into consideration during discussions on eligibility, that sufficient demand for the CDM will provide financial resources for the Fund.", 
    "A contact group was established to facilitate further discussions."
