    "With one day of COP-9 remaining, some observers have remarked on the growing divisions in the negotiating positions of regional groups and the amount of time spent coordinating and building consensus within groups.", 
    "One delegate observed that if the groups are unable to agree on their negotiating positions, then the possibility of reaching consensus in the final COP Plenary, which will deal with outstanding decisions on financing, might be in jeopardy.", 
    "Despite consensus-building attempts by President Pers\u00e1nyi, negotiations on the SCCF continued late into the night Thursday, with disagreement and entrenched positions defining the discussions.", 
    "On the LDC Fund, another observer suggested that President Pers\u00e1nyi should be prepared for a 'highly charged' meeting with LDC ministers on Friday, to resolve growing resentment between LDCs and some developed countries over inaction and indecision on the necessary steps to implement NAPAs. On another note, while the environmental NGOs hosted a birthday party for the Protocol, several observers were wondering whether the 120 Parties to the Protocol would initiate a 'Friends of the Protocol' meeting.", 
    "Some have suggested that such an initiative would not be missed by Russia\u0092s President Putin who would not want to be an 'outsider' to this important leadership initiative."
