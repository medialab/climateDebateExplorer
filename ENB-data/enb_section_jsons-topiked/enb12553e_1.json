    "On developing country mitigation, facilitator Gary Theseira reported that the spin-off group considered a note on elements which could become part of an outcome in Doha, saying elements identified by parties included: reiterating calls for NAMAs and enhanced provision of support; further discussions on understanding the diversity of NAMAs; development of guidelines for MRV of support; and proposals for building the capacity of countries to prepare and implement NAMAs, such as through regional workshops, guidelines and handbooks.", 
    "On REDD+ financing, facilitator Yaw Osafo reported the group discussions built on the in-session workshop on REDD+, and focused on, inter alia : guiding principles; enabling conditions necessary for scaling-up and facilitating financing; issues that require further exploration; and signals required from Doha to incentivize financing for the full implementation of REDD+.",

    "On adaptation, he indicated that parties identified issues requiring further work on, inter alia : means of implementation for adaptation; financing for 2013-2015; linkages with finance; national adaptation plans for non-LDCs; and the catalytic role of the Convention.", 
    "He said divergent views remain on whether the AWG-LCA should further address these issues and if additional decisions are required.",

    "On Review, facilitator Gertraud Wollansky reported that two options on the scope of the Review are on the table, one based on Decision 1/CP.16 para 138 (Review) and the other further defining the scope to include the assessment of the implementation of commitments under the Convention, including means of implementation provided to developing countries.",

SWITZERLAND, on behalf of the EIG, cautioned parties not to change the focus and character of the contact group, called for focusing energies on discussions in the spin-off groups and said topics for discussion in the spin-off group should complement the agreed outcome under the AWG-LCA.",

    "Kenya, for the AFRICAN GROUP, called for a process to take forward technical issues, saying a very comprehensive decision on this will be needed in Doha.

    "He noted that successful closure of the AWG-LCA was a key part of the Durban decision. SOUTH AFRICA noted lack of clarity on key elements, such as comparability, finance, technology and adaptation.", 
    "He said the institutions established in Cancun and Durban were not the right platform to discuss commitments under the Convention, and urged engaging on substantive discussion on these issues to bring them to a logical conclusion in Doha.
