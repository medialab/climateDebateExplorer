    "The AWG-LCA began its work on preparation of an outcome at COP 16 on Monday, and continued to address this topic for the rest of the week.", 
    "In particular, they focused on the Chair s text distributed in July and designed to help advance discussions (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/8).", 
    "The text contained chapters based around the sections agreed in the Bali Action Plan (BAP) in 2007.", 
    "During the opening plenary, many parties said the Chair s text was acceptable as the basis for discussions.", 
    "Yemen, speaking for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), said the text needed a more balanced and equitable treatment of many issues, however supported starting negotiations on the basis of the Chair s text.", 
    "Australia, for the Umbrella Group, said the text needed elaboration on issues such as forestry, international consultation and analysis (ICA) for developing countries, mitigation and monitoring, review and verification (MRV), as well as tighter, more operative language.", 
    "Ecuador, for the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), called for 300 parts per million (ppm) targets, with temperature increases well below 1.5\u00b0C.", 
    "The Russian Federation said an agreement should cover all major emitters and economies.", 
    "Japan supported a comprehensive, legally-binding outcome involving major emitters and within a single framework.", 
    "He opposed separating the world into Kyoto and non-Kyoto groups.", 
    "The US addressed concerns over US domestic climate politics, declaring that success in Canc\u00fan does not hinge on US legislation.", 
    "Following the opening statements in plenary, delegates took up their discussions in a working group chaired by AWG-LCA Vice-Chair Dan Reifsnyder (US).", 
    "After lengthy discussions, on Tuesday delegates decided to split into four drafting groups focused on the following issues: shared vision; mitigation; adaptation; and finance, capacity building and technology transfer.", 
    "In addition, delegates held informal consultations on the form of the outcome at COP 16 and the legal nature of obligations, commitments and actions by parties.", 
    "These groups added many different (and sometimes conflicting) options and proposals to the text.", 
    "This resulted in longer documents on most of the key issues.", 
    "The texts resulting from these discussions will be compiled into an official negotiating text and released prior to AWG-LCA 12 in October.", 
    "The key discussions and suggested additions to the text are outlined below, based on the drafting groups deliberations.", 
    "Shared Vision: This drafting group was facilitated by Dan Reifsnyder and focused on the relevant section of the Chair s text (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/8, Chapter 1, paragraphs 1-12).", 
    "Delegates made numerous suggestions to amend or add to the text, including on emissions cuts, global reductions and funding.", 
    "On emissions cuts and global temperatures (paragraph 2), some differences of opinion emerged, with developing countries stressing historical responsibility for emissions and some proposing to limit the global temperature increase to below 1.5\u00b0C from pre-industrial levels.", 
    "However, the US and other developed countries indicated that 2\u00b0C, not 1.5\u00b0C, was the limit agreed by leaders under the Copenhagen Accord.", 
    "The US also argued that this goal was intended to inspire and guide, but was not an operational directive to divide rights to the atmosphere based on a formula.", 
    "Saudi Arabia responded that the Copenhagen Accord was not adopted by the COP and is not a legally-binding document and so should not determine what is included in a UNFCCC document.", 
    "On global reductions by 2050 (paragraph 4), suggestions ranged from a 50% global goal to more than 100% compared with 1990 levels.", 
    "There were also suggestions to identify Annex I parties collective goals for 2020 through 2050, with developing countries generally proposing more ambitious targets (in one case, up to 45% by 2020 and more than 100% by 2040 ).", 
    "China proposed text that Annex I parties 2050 targets should not imply that developing countries will pick up the remainder of the emission reductions.", 
    "He said developing countries contribution will depend on Annex I parties meeting commitments on financing and technology transfer.", 
    "On adaptation, financing and the impact of response measures , some developing countries suggested specifying Annex I parties funding obligations, including one requiring that developed countries provide 3% of their GNP to ensure implementation of the Convention.", 
    "Mitigation: Discussions on mitigation took up more time than any other issue under the AWG-LCA, and was taken up throughout the week in a drafting group and spin-off groups.", 
    "The focus of the discussions was the Chair s revised text from July 2010 (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/8), which includes sections dealing with various elements of mitigation.", 
    "These are based on key paragraphs in the BAP (Decision 1/CP.13), as follows: mitigation by developed countries (BAP paragraph 1(b)(i)); mitigation by developing countries (1(b)(ii)); REDD-plus (1(b)(iii)); cooperative sectoral approaches and sector-specific actions (1(b)(iv)); approaches to enhance the cost effectiveness of mitigation actions (market mechanisms) (1(b)(iv)); and consequences of response measures (1(b)(v)).", 
    "During AWG-LCA 11, delegates discussed the Chair s draft text at length, suggesting amendments to every relevant section.", 
    "This exercise resulted in almost tripling the length of the mitigation text, from approximately 15 to 41 pages.", 
    "The section below summarizes the discussions on each of these mitigation issues.", 
    "Developed countries: This issue (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/8, Chapter 1, paragraphs 14-27) was addressed in a drafting group on Tuesday facilitated by AWG-LCA Chair Mukahanana-Sangarwe.", 
    "The main issues addressed included: the baseline and target years; aggregate reduction ranges; the legally-binding nature of the agreement; relationship to the Kyoto Protocol, including inscription of targets and flexible mechanisms; the use of other market mechanisms and eligibility for participation; the nature of, and changes to, Annex I; comparability of efforts; response measures; MRV provisions; LULUCF; and historical emissions.", 
    "Many interventions by developing country delegates called for strengthened compliance guidelines, MRV and national communications.", 
    "One developing party stressed the need to pursue sustainable consumption and production.", 
    "Several commented on the importance of development of low-emission plans, with developed countries noting this should apply to all parties and developing countries suggesting this should apply only to Annex I parties.", 
    "Many developed countries defended using the word objectives, while developing countries preferred the term commitments.", 
    "Developing countries: This issue (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/8, Chapter 1, paragraphs 28-51) was addressed in drafting group meetings held on Wednesday and Thursday and facilitated by AWG-LCA Chair Mukahanana-Sangarwe.", 
    "The aspect that received the most attention was reporting requirements by developing countries in the context of MRV, national inventories and registries, with developed countries making numerous suggestions.", 
    "In their comments, parties also addressed the types and scope of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs), support for NAMAs by developed countries, and the linkage between that support and the NAMA registry.", 
    "The G-77/China made a proposal for the establishment of a mitigation mechanism to ensure the provision of financial resources, technology and capacity building for the implementation of NAMAs.", 
    "One developing country said nationally supported NAMAs should be included in the NAMA registry.", 
    "Special reporting conditions for small island developing states (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs) were discussed, with proposals ranging from voluntary reporting to reporting at longer intervals than other countries.", 
    "Issues of categorization of parties, specification of support and ICA, among others, were also addressed."
