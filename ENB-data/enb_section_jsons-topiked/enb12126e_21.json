    "In his report on the working group session on indicators, Chair Moisan noted that while indicators could help develop policies and evaluate progress on whether targets and commitments are being met they are not a perfect tool to capture every relevant detail, and that there are other useful tools available.", 
    "He drew attention to some participants' view that disaggregated data may be more useful than aggregated indicators.", 
    "Regarding follow-up actions, he said further work would be useful on methodological approaches, cooperation involving international organizations, and information sharing."
