    "On the issue of compliance, while the majority of Parties had expressed support for a 'strong' compliance system, the translation of this objective into legal and technical terms revealed divergent positions on issues such as: differentiating treatment of compliance for Annex I and non-Annex I Parties; enforcement consequences; the method of adoption of a compliance regime; and the composition of the compliance bodies.", 
    "In the eyes of a number of observers, Pronk's proposals on compliance provide the most positive set of compromises.", 
    "He seems to have struck a fair balance between the Parties' main expectations on enforcement consequences, differentiated treatment, and the composition of bodies.", 
    "While his Note does not provide any suggestions for the method of adoption of the compliance regime, this is an issue on which a satisfactory solution is possible once consensus is reached on the content of text on compliance procedures and mechanisms.", 
    "Compliance thus seems to be one of the 'crunch' issues that could be handled relatively smoothly at the resumed COP-6 session.", 
    "However, achieving balance between deterrence and overly- stringent enforceable consequences will be a matter of fine tuning."
