    "The scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change, were first taken up by SBSTA 22 on Thursday, 19 May.", 
    "The aim of discussions on this item was to develop a five-year SBSTA work programme on adaptation, as mandated by decision 1/CP.10 (Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures).", 
    "After an in-session workshop, numerous informal consultations and six contact group meetings, delegates agreed to SBSTA conclusions, which included a draft COP decision and draft annex on the SBSTA programme.", 
    "However, as this was the first session where the work programme was formally discussed, SBSTA did not finalize the programme, and the draft decision and annex remain bracketed.", 
    "Parties did agree, though, that the first step in the process should be to conduct a comprehensive stock taking exercise. To facilitate the development of this work programme, SBSTA organized an in-session workshop, which was held on Saturday, 21 May.", 
    "The workshop was co-chaired by Philip Gwage (Uganda) and David Warrilow (UK), and consisted of a key note presentation by Ian Burton, University of Toronto, and presentations by fifteen country representatives.", 
    "Common themes among the presenters included the need for information sharing and international cooperation, bottom-up approaches, engaging both practitioners and policy makers, and integration into sustainable development.", 
    "A summary of these discussions is available online at: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12265e.html. SBSTA then reconvened on Monday, 23 May, to take up the item and hear a summary of the workshop.", 
    "A contact group, co-chaired by Marjorie Pyoos (South Africa) and James Shevlin (Australia), was set up to continue consultations. Basing their discussion on the SBSTA Vice-Chair\u0092s summary of the workshop, which contained possible elements of the programme of work, deliberations in the contact group centered on the objectives of the programme and on possible approaches.", 
    "Delegates engaged in an initial exchange of views, in which the G-77/China and AOSIS reiterated their call for action-oriented measures and said that the need to expedite these should not be restricted by calls for further assessments.", 
    "The EU, the US and New Zealand favored improved understanding and cooperation.", 
    "The G-77/China and AOSIS also called for reference to the most vulnerable, with AOSIS calling for a special track for SIDS to address urgent needs.", 
    "Saudi Arabia underscored adaptation to response measures. On the structure of the work programme, the US highlighted the need to focus on priority sectors.", 
    "The G-77/China proposed instead using a variety of integrated approaches that would proceed in parallel and not sequentially.", 
    "This included a livelihoods approach that focuses on assets ('capitals') as opposed to a sectoral approach.", 
    "The Africa Group warned that a sectoral approach could marginalize local knowledge.", 
    "Japan also preferred taking a broad thematic approach to avoid time-consuming discussions on priority sectors.", 
    "The G-77/China and AOSIS called for establishing an experts\u0092 working group to advance work and ensure follow-up. Debate on the draft conclusions and decision focused on whether to make reference to decision 1/CP.10, as proposed by the G-77/China, or to the subsection under decision 1/CP.10 that refers specifically to SBSTA and to the work programme.", 
    "Saudi Arabia, opposed by the EU, Switzerland, Norway and others, said that referring to the whole decision covers the interests of all Parties.", 
    "On Thursday, 26 May, SBSTA Chair Benrageb offered to conduct an informal workshop before SB 23 to facilitate the development of the work programme, and, following minor editorial amendments, delegates agreed to the draft conclusions, which were adopted by SBSTA in plenary on 27 May."
