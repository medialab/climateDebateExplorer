    "Despite the previous week\u0092s apparent lack of momentum, the final week of the meeting began with an intense schedule of contact groups, leaving delegations exhausted, if only from running around the Maritim.", 
    "Some observers felt that many of the discussions saw at least the creation of a basis for progress, with important ground-work laid in the contact groups on adaptation and mitigation, and on national communications.", 
    "Others feared entrenchment of negotiating positions on accounting for sinks would heat up the rest of the week."
