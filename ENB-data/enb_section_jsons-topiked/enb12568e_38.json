    "At the last CMP meeting in Doha, Qatar, in 2012, an amendment was adopted to the Kyoto Protocol creating a second commitment period that commits Annex I parties to an average 18% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2020.", 
    "However, today, the second commitment period only covers 15% of global emissions.", 
    "It is now apparent that Annex I parties Kyoto targets, combined with the bottom-up pledges by developed and developing countries under the Convention, are not sufficient to keep the global temperature rise below 2\u00b0C.", 
    "According to the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2012, the 2\u00b0C target will slip out of reach unless more ambitious action is taken before 2020.", 
    "With the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention and the Ad Hoc Working Group on Annex I Parties Further Commitments under the Kyoto Protocol having completed their work in Doha, all eyes are now on the remaining Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action.", 
    "The ADP has a tremendous task ahead to complete its two objectives- to develop a new legal instrument under the Convention applicable to all parties by 2015 to come into effect in 2020, and close the pre-2020 ambition gap.", 
    "This brief analysis focuses on expectations for, and developments during, the Bonn session, and looks into how this meeting played out in the context of the overall UNFCCC process."
