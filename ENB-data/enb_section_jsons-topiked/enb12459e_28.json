    "In its decision, the COP, among other things: requests developing countries to, inter alia , identify drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, use the most recent IPCC guidance to estimate emissions and establish national forest monitoring systems; encourages capacity-building support from all able parties to support capacity building in developing countries; encourages development of guidance for indigenous peoples and local community engagement; recognizes that forest reference emission levels should take into account historic data, and adjust for national circumstances; and urges coordination of efforts."
