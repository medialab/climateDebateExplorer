    "The Panel, in its final decision on the IPCC Trust Fund programme and budget, inter alia : - approves modifications proposed by the Secretariat to the 2012 budget and the 2013 budget proposal; - notes that the pressures of resource needs on the budget will increase along the course of the AR5 cycle, requests that countries maintain their generous contributions in 2012 and 2013, and invites governments, in a position to do so, to increase their contributions to the Trust Fund; - endorses the expression of concern to the WMO with regard to inflexible application of the WMO travel rules in relation to the travel of developing country members of the IPCC Bureau and some experts; and - recommends that the Secretariat undertake an analysis of the cost and practicability of holding IPCC meetings in Geneva."
