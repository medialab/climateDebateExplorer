    "There were already signs of the jockeying and positioning that will happen at Montreal, given that the process is about to enter new and uncharted waters.", 
    "Different Parties and negotiating groups are entering this new phase with competing mandates regarding the Convention and the Protocol. The US seems determined to continue its engagement in the UNFCCC, not to ratify Kyoto, and to keep a very careful eye on the interaction between the two processes.", 
    "This manifested itself at SB 22 with carefully-crafted US statements and positions on linkages with other processes, and their attitude on the budget implications for the UNFCCC-Kyoto interface.", 
    "Saudi Arabia and its OPEC partners succeeded in ensuring that the discussion on emissions from maritime transport and international aviation barely left port, and expect to take center stage at the COP/MOP debate on how to address the compliance mechanism issue.", 
    "The EU\u0092s position at the SOGE was based on a determination to keep the door open for the further development of a post-2012 'formal process.", 
    "' The EU seems ever conscious of the sensitivities of the US and the G-77/China, and Europe\u0092s own vocal business and industry lobby, which has concerns about competitiveness.", 
    "According to some, China has stepped up its engagement in the process.", 
    "Meanwhile, the Canadian Presidency is expected to float possible trigger strategies for the post-2012 discussion during bilateral and multilateral discussions during the intersessional period, while striking a balance between its relations with the US and EU.", 
    "There is little expectation that any agenda item introduced by Canada will go beyond a discussion, for example at the High Level segment, at this stage. These and other issues will be in play in Montreal.", 
    "The long range weather forecast still points to extreme events."
