    "The SBI conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.9 and Corr.1), inter alia, note that 12 Parties had been visited by international review teams, and the information contained in national communications provided a basis for the consideration of progress in the implementation of the UNFCCC. The COP draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.9/Add.1): urges Annex I Parties that have not submitted their first, second, or third national communication or annual greenhouse gas inventory to do so as soon as possible; requests the Parties to submit a fourth national communication by 1 January 2006; and concludes that review of the national communications should continue."
