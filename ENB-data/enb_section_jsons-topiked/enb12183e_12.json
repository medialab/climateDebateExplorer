    "'Fatigue' and 'deadline' were the words on delegates' lips Friday.", 
    "Observers noted that many negotiators were looking decidedly less fresh and energized following several long days of talks and running from one meeting to the next, with several participants openly hoping that Sunday would be a rest day before COP-7's final week and the high-level segment.", 
    "The Saturday evening deadline announced by COP-7 President Elyazghi on Friday was generally well received, with some delegates seemingly pleased that a time had been set for completion of work, although several seemed to think that it might be overly optimistic. In other news, the long-awaited meeting on accounting for assigned amounts under Article 7.4 finally took place Friday night.", 
    "While some expressed frustration that the meeting was suspended following the submissions of new proposals from Parties, others felt the consolidation of these proposals by the Co-Chairs overnight would help considerably in further talks scheduled for Saturday."
