    "In its conclusions regarding Croatia s appeal (FCCC/KP/CMP/2010/L.7), the COP/MOP notes that: it initiated consideration of the appeal; was unable to complete the consideration of this item at this session; and the item will therefore be included on the provisional agenda for COP/MOP 7.", 
    "It also requests the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper outlining: the procedural requirements, and the scope and content of applicable law for the consideration of appeals; and the approach taken by constituted bodies under other multilateral environmental agreements and other international bodies in relation to provisions for the consideration of denial of due process."
