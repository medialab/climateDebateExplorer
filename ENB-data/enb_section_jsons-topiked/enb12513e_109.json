    "How do you drive a multi-track process forward when some parties already have what they want, others want what is impossible and all imagine different futures?", 
    "This was the challenge faced by delegates in Bonn as they attempted to negotiate a path towards the UN Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa in six months time.", 
    "Like Odysseus who faced many dangers on his long journey home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, governments have to navigate through their own hazards if they want to have a successful outcome in Durban.", 
    "This brief analysis will assess progress in Bonn in the context of the delegates journey to Durban, beginning with the adoption of the Cancun Agreements at the end of 2010 and its impact on the agendas in the Subsidiary Bodies; the intention of some parties not to inscribe targets in the context of a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol; and how to close the gap between the mitigation pledges on the table and the emission reductions needed to avoid dangerous climate change. HOMEWARD BOUND?", 
    "When Odysseus escaped the Cyclops Polyphemus and thought he was home free, Odysseus s sailors opened a gift from Aeolus, the master of the winds, and the resulting storm drove the ships back the way they had come, just as Ithaca came into sight.", 
    "Similarly when delegates escaped the agenda battles in Bangkok in April, they thought that they would be able to start their negotiations anew in Bonn.", 
    "However, they soon found themselves faced with a new obstacle- another agenda debate, this time in the Subsidiary Bodies.", 
    "One of the central challenges in the Bangkok meeting concerning the agenda of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA) was how to take elements of the Cancun Agreements forward, while taking into account that Bolivia objected to their adoption in Cancun.", 
    "The first meetings of the Subsidiary Bodies after Cancun faced a similar hurdle.", 
    "The Cancun Agreements, although lauded by many, were less than clear on the mandates for moving forward.", 
    "For instance, while many countries supported technical work under the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) on the framework for measuring, reporting and verification (MRV), some developing country parties said the Cancun Agreements had not given the SBI a clear mandate to do this.", 
    "On the forum on the impacts of the implementation of response measures, disagreement persisted on what the mandate in the Cancun Agreements meant in terms of title and structure, until the Chairs of the SBI and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) decided they had a mandate to conduct the forum regardless of its title.", 
    "The AWGs, having resolved their agenda problems in Bangkok, were able to commence deliberations immediately in Bonn.", 
    "However, the AWG-LCA groaned under the weight of efforts to institutionalize the Cancun Agreements and make progress on outstanding issues.", 
    "Progress on some issues, such as developed and developing country mitigation, remained slow as parties struggled to sequence issues in a way that made them all comfortable, and some ensured that technical work on some parts of the text were contingent upon technical work on other parts.", 
    "On issues where there was more progress, such as the Technology Mechanism, some worried that everything would grind to a halt if parties perceived that they were getting ahead of other issues.", 
    "Just as Odysseus tried to keep his crew together, delegates were unwilling in Bonn to let work progress unevenly, lest discussions on one issue prejudge the outcomes of another.", 
    "One of the challenges in the intervening months before Durban will be how to move issues forward across and within the four bodies in relative lock-step, without falling into an inescapable circular debate driven by the siren call of entrenched positions.", 
    "As one delegate put it, we have to resist the temptation to give in to self-interest."
