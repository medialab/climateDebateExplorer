    "In light of the linkages between inputs and analysis and assessment, the Chair said that statements on inputs could include references to relevant issues raised during discussions on analysis and assessments.", 
    "He noted that it was important that the AGBM frame its requests for information carefully.", 
    "He reminded delegates to keep in mind the following: time constraints; provisions of inputs by the subsidiary bodies; and, the process for obtaining information from the IPCC, given its own programme of work.", 
    "He added that it was important to differentiate between those inputs required for the upcoming October session and those required for later sessions. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said although the BM is a complex and noble undertaking, practical matters needed to be addressed in the work on a legal instrument, particularly for countries with economies in transition.", 
    "Measures to reduce emissions should be undertaken in the context of economic development needs.", 
    "Taking the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibility,' there was a need for a more flexible approach perhaps through regional protocols based on either geographical or economic factors and incorporated through a ratification process.", 
    "He supported the Indian proposal of selecting scenarios as well as the Swiss proposal of selecting expert panels.", 
    "CHILE expressed dismay that discussions appeared to be moving backward rather than forward.", 
    "He said that the BM is precise in its mandate and should not discuss all the issues relevant to the Convention.", 
    "Under the BM, the AGBM cannot make those bodies do its work but should specify the questions to be asked. SAUDI ARABIA said that analysis and assessment should be given sufficient time in order to facilitate negotiations on any future commitments.", 
    "He added that although some delegations think this will delay the process, it will speed future negotiations because any information missing now will cause hesitation later.", 
    "He said that the AGBM needs time to evaluate the existing commitments and should also consider the economic costs and the environmental benefits of each proposal beyond the year 2000.", 
    "He noted that the cost is not limited to Annex I Parties and rejected the idea that this process was the 'business' of only Annex I Parties.", 
    "BRAZIL said the major tasks of this group are to decide collectively on overall emissions and to apply the concept of common but differentiated responsibility.", 
    "He suggested a methodology for apportioning an appropriate share of contribution for each country based on environmental impacts.", 
    "He also commented that the IPCC has taken its work very seriously and is devoting energy to international cooperation. SAMOA, on behalf of AOSIS, stated that requests for inputs should not lead to 'an open season' for data gathering, some of which may be superfluous.", 
    "He added that through the IPCC a tradition of information gathering has been established.", 
    "He said that inputs and assessments should not drive this process in an unfocused manner but the AGBM should instead ask for specific inputs.", 
    "KUWAIT disagreed with the EU, noting that this Convention was more far-reaching that the Montreal Protocol, and required a more 'open-minded' process.", 
    "He cautioned that if this Convention\u0092s targets are exaggerated now, they cannot be relaxed later, nor can the economic deprivation be erased.", 
    "He added that there may be a wealth of relevant material available, but there are not many works covering the economic impacts of reductions on developing countries.", 
    "The NETHERLANDS stated that the key issues are clearly spelled out in the BM, and that assessments and analysis should not be used to determine whether policies and measures are needed.", 
    "He added that the advancement of commitments would greatly benefit from the transfer of technology.", 
    "He highlighted the importance of using international technical bodies, and supported Brazil\u0092s remarks on the possible inputs from the IPCC and balanced contributions from the Parties.", 
    "He said that the AGBM should focus on provisions that enable the exchange of information on national communications, not the technical workings of each policy. VENEZUELA said that any action undertaken by Annex I Parties to reduce emissions will affect the economies of developing countries, and that any assessments should include these effects.", 
    "He pointed out that there were few cross-comparisons of the impacts of the measures of one set of countries on another and that an integrated analysis was needed.", 
    "He believed that inputs should not be curtailed.", 
    "JAPAN suggested that work should be carried out in light of the best available scientific information, and that the SBSTA and SBI should play important roles.", 
    "Each of the Parties should submit a national communication, which should be reviewed in depth, and all measures should be compiled and synthesized both on a sectoral and national level.", 
    "He added that there are many sources of information available, and supported the compilation of an inventory of all existing information.", 
    "POLAND supported the statement made by the Russian Federation, and stated that the AGBM should ask SBSTA to analyze national policy actions based on national communications and OECD/IEA work.", 
    "He said that the AGBM should work with inputs from the subsidiary bodies to analyze and recommend particular scenarios to the COP.", 
    "CHINA noted that the word 'inputs' appeared to have many different interpretations.", 
    "He said that the 'inputs' submitted by the Parties in the form of draft protocols and interventions should be the basis of negotiations on a legal instrument.", 
    "He emphasized that only Parties to the Convention can be Parties to the Protocol.", 
    "He said that inputs such as the submissions made by international organizations and the subsidiary bodies provide information and that all submissions must conform to the BM.", 
    "He concluded by stating that he could not accept the German elements proposal because it called for additional commitments from certain large developing countries and was contrary to the BM. AUSTRALIA stated that climate change is a global problem and that the actions taken by Annex I Parties had implications for developing countries.", 
    "She said that inputs to analysis and assessments must encompass the full range of economic, environmental and social studies from national and international sources and must consider all sources and sinks.", 
    "In addition, studies of activities implemented jointly were also deemed important to the AGBM process.", 
    "She proposed both top-down approaches including economic modeling used by OECD and IEA and bottom-up approaches including examinations of sectors and cost effective technologies.", 
    "She suggested the early completion of Annex I Parties\u0092 communications.", 
    "She supported the consideration of the AOSIS protocol and the German elements as inputs to analysis and assessment activities.", 
    "The CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC highlighted the lack of funding for developing countries.", 
    "He supported the AOSIS statement and the need for strengthening Annex I Parties commitments.", 
    "He also commented on the national micro-project estimating carbon dioxide emissions from fuel wood use. The US stated that it was fully aware of the BM\u0092s provisions.", 
    "He said a comprehensive approach is needed because actions by Annex I Parties would affect non-Annex I Parties.", 
    "He said that although national communications from non-Annex I Parties were not yet due, many non-Annex I Parties are taking successful measures and that information on these would be useful to Annex I Parties.", 
    "He provided a partial list of organizations that could provide inputs on the following: analysis on the AOSIS protocol and the German and UK proposals; market and sectoral approaches; fiscal mechanisms and activities implemented jointly; future forecasts and historic emission trends, energy, successful technological options, and methane.", 
    "The organizations included: the US EPA, OECD, UNEP, IPCC, World Bank, IMF, FAO, US Department of Energy, IIASA, Carnegie Mellon, Oxford Consulting, the Brookings Institute, Alliance to Save Energy, relevant research institutes at Stanford, Yale, MIT and Harvard, EDF and the NRDC.", 
    "He supported the convening of an expert panel.", 
    "NIGERIA said that the one salient point that recurred throughout the discussion was that analysis and assessment activities were central to the AGBM process.", 
    "He suggested a gradient scale approach with analyses of policies and measures followed by constructive negotiations.", 
    "He asked whether speculation or scientific fact was going to be negotiated.", 
    "He noted that the two processes cannot occur simultaneously.", 
    "He requested the Secretariat to 'tap' all relevant regional organizations in the world including OPEC and OLADE and emphasized the lack of funding for the participation of developing countries. PERU felt that the basic aspects being discussed regarding inputs are: priority criterion; a 'middle of the road' stance as to whether analysis and assessments should occur simultaneously with negotiations; information on the economic impacts for developing countries of Annex I Parties adopting emissions reductions, and the definition of the Parties\u0092 positions with regard to contributions.", 
    "NORWAY supported the Netherlands and commented that the IPCC was the key body for giving technical and scientific advice.", 
    "He pointed out that the BM mentioned the IPCC\u0092s role and that the AGBM should contact IPCC in order to work out practical solutions.", 
    "COLOMBIA commented that inputs are a key element of the BM and that the AGBM must be clear about time frames.", 
    "She stated the group should proceed with negotiations parallel to analysis and assessment activities.", 
    "She supported comments made by Peru, and noted that the only way to achieve the goal of the Convention was to move forward in all areas.", 
    "GERMANY stated that apparently considerable doubt remained on the German position, in light of comments by China.", 
    "She said that with regard to the German elements paper submitted in September last year, the reference to a certain category of developing countries was outdated.", 
    "She added that other policies, also in the paper, have been seen by many delegations as a useful input for negotiating new commitments.", 
    "FRANCE supported the EU and emphasized the need not to delay until the end of the process to embark upon negotiations.", 
    "He said that without a parallel process, it would be difficult to agree when the analysis should stop and negotiations should start.", 
    "MAURITIUS said the BM is precise, and contains a clear direction and mandate.", 
    "He noted that many delegations said there is enough material existing, and suggested that this information be used as inputs in the AGBM process.", 
    "Supporting Norway, he said that an active role for IPCC would prove fruitful. At the end of the third day, the Chair said that he would produce a preliminary paper after consulting with different delegations regarding the distribution of time between analysis and assessment activities and negotiations.", 
    "He said that governments should come up with lists of possible inputs and added that an objective synthesis of views would help orient the delegates, as would an annotated compilation of publications relevant to analysis and assessment, and a specialized document based on national communications.", 
    "The Chair allowed two more interventions on this topic at the start of the fourth day.", 
    "The CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK (CAN) stated that the success of the BM process will not be judged on the basis of discussions on analysis and assessment but by the first emission reduction steps for the Convention.", 
    "He noted that while few developed countries are opposed to the early initiation of negotiations, there was an evident lack of leadership.", 
    "CAN proposed a timetable which would begin negotiations on an emission reduction protocol in October, and urged delegates not to stop the BM process before it had started.", 
    "BANGLADESH, supporting Germany, stated that the AGBM must start negotiations on policies and measures for Annex I parties, and added that analysis and assessment could be done simultaneously. The Chair suggested using the substantive ideas of the BM, such as analysis and assessment, policies and measures, quantified limitations, as the basis for agenda items for the second AGBM session (AGBM 2).", 
    "SPAIN, on behalf of the EU, mentioned four necessary elements for the agenda: structure and possible elements for the contents of the Protocol; methodology on drafting the Protocol; consideration of the inputs received; and, further work for the AGBM, such as setting deadlines for proposed inputs on objectives and time horizons.", 
    "SAMOA, on behalf of the AOSIS, said that the Secretariat should prepare a document that addresses inputs for analysis and assessments in accordance with paragraph 5 of the BM (protocol proposals).", 
    "He added that Parties should cover the following topics: quantified limitations and reduction objectives; coordination mechanisms; institutional arrangements; and, transfer of technology. SAUDI ARABIA, supported by KUWAIT, stressed the need to concentrate on analysis and assessment activities during AGBM 2, and questioned whether negotiations could proceed in absence of adequate information.", 
    "He said that methodologies should be identified.", 
    "The PHILIPPINES, on behalf of the G-77 and CHINA, stated that the G-77 was still discussing this issue.", 
    "SWITZERLAND suggested that their proposals to establish technical advisory panels, along with prioritized topics for work, could be addressed in upcoming session.", 
    "NIGERIA, supporting both the G-77 and China and Saudi Arabia, said that he would hold the Chair to his promise of reviewing sources of information.", 
    "He said that the AGBM should not be restricted to the IPCC in carrying out analysis and assessments.", 
    "He added that many compromises had been made in past negotiations and that certain bottom-line needs could not be compromised in this meeting.", 
    "US said that it would be more useful to describe specific analytical inputs.", 
    "He requested the Secretariat to circulate its document prior to AGBM 2 in October, adding that the results could be used to decide which outside inputs are required.", 
    "He stated that the upcoming session should be used to begin a study of global emissions trends and that the Secretariat could ask governments to nominate experts and then select a panel from among these nominations.", 
    "AGBM 2 would also be a good time to consider fiscal mechanisms and activities implemented jointly."
