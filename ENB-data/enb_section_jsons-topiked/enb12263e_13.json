    "As SB-22 got underway Thursday morning, there were few signs of the enthusiasm or openness evident at the Seminar of Governmental Experts earlier in the week.", 
    "Apparently, few delegates expected such enthusiasm.", 
    "'Business-as-usual' is how one delegate described the day\u0092s session, which began with lengthy disagreements over the adoption of the SBSTA agenda due to initial objections from Saudi Arabia.", 
    "'Standard delaying tactics,' is how another delegate described the dispute, although some delegates seemed gratified by the G-77/China's stated position in support of the agenda.", 
    "For its part, the Saudi delegation was adamant its concerns were genuine. Meanwhile, one expert pointed out that delegations are smaller at SB-22 than at previous SBs, and speculated on whether Parties are 'keeping their powder dry' for COP/MOP-1."
