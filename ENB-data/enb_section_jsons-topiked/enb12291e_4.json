    "In late October and early November 2001 at COP 7, delegates resumed their discussions and reached agreement on the Marrakesh Accords.", 
    "These Accords consist of a package of draft decisions on many of the details of the flexible mechanisms, reporting and methodologies, land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) and compliance with the Kyoto Protocol that should be adopted by the first COP/MOP.", 
    "The Accords also address support for developing countries, including capacity building, technology transfer, responding to the adverse effects of climate change, and the establishment of three funds - the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Fund, Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and Adaptation Fund. Delegates built on the Marrakesh Accords at COP 8 and COP 9, agreeing on rules and procedures for the CDM Executive Board, and on modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM.", 
    "Parties also discussed how to integrate findings of the IPCC\u0092s Third Assessment Report into the work of the UNFCCC, and agreed on two new agenda items focused on adaptation and mitigation."
