    "Delegates continued considering the Chair's draft consolidated text on mechanisms, indicating areas where their submissions had not been reflected, and adding text where necessary.", 
    "On the CDM, delegates differed on the need for, inter alia: all three mechanisms to contribute to the adaptation fund; investment and technology additionality; monitoring of economic, social and cultural impacts of projects; and an option that reflects the various proposed CDMs, including unilateral, bilateral and multilateral.", 
    "They discussed: the role of the COP/MOP and the Executive Board; the content and extensiveness of the CDM Reference Manual; common baselines for the CDM; equitable distribution of CDM projects; and requirements and costs of the CDM. On emissions trading, delegates differed on the need for, inter alia: the usage of the Protocol-consistent term 'Part of an Assigned Amount' instead of 'Assigned Amount Units'; legal entities to participate in the CDM; a share of proceeds from emissions trading to fund adaptation; and limits on transfers.", 
    "The group accepted draft conclusions for SBSTA/SBI agreeing to forward the 'consolidated text on principles, modalities, rules and guidelines' to SB-13 as a basis for further negotiation."
