    "On the status of the consultative process relating to the development and transfer of technologies (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.2), delegates recommended a decision to the COP to, inter alia, extend the consultative process until COP-6 and invite non-Annex I Parties to report on their technology needs in their national communications. Delegates adopted the Chair's draft conclusions on: coastal adaptation technologies (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.21); other matters relating to the Secretariat's cooperation activities with the OECD's Development Assistance Committee to provide comprehensive data (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.18); and ways and means of limiting emissions of hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.7)."
