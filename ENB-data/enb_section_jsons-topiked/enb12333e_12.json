    "Developed countries took the view that this request was in accordance with Convention Article 10.2 (consideration of national communications), and had expressed the hope that SBI 26 could make better use of the valuable information that these documents contain and assist non-Annex I parties to further improve these documents (FCCC/SBI/2006/MISC.12).",
