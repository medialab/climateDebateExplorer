    "COP/MOP 2 : Held in November 2006, in Nairobi, Kenya, COP 12 and COP/MOP 2 placed strong emphasis on discussions on long-term action and a framework following on from the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period, which finishes in 2012.", 
    "The multi-track approach to these issues agreed at COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 continued, with meetings of the AWG and the UNFCCC Dialogue, which included a discussion on the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change.", 
    "In addition, a review of the Protocol was convened, as required under Article 9, and discussions were held on a proposal by the Russian Federation on procedures to approve voluntary commitments under the Protocol.", 
    "While the Nairobi conference did not result in any major breakthrough in negotiations, it did mark a staging post as negotiators seek to pave the way for a future post-2012 agreement."
