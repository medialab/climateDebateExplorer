    "The SBI conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.14/Add.1) contain a draft COP decision, in which the COP states that the operation of the LDC Fund should be consistent with the following principles: a country-driven approach, supporting the implementation of urgent and immediate activities identified in NAPAs, as a way of enhancing adaptive capacity; support for implementation of activities identified in NAPAs and of other elements of the LDC work programme as identified in decision 5/CP.7, to promote the integration of adaptation measures in national development and poverty reduction strategies, plans or policies, with a view to increasing resilience to the adverse effects of climate change; and support for a learning-by-doing approach. Also included in the draft decision are: a decision that full-cost funding shall be provided by the LDC Fund to meet the additional costs - defined as 'the costs imposed on vulnerable countries to meet their immediate adaptation need' - of activities to adopt to the adverse effects of climate change as identified and prioritized in the NAPAs; a request that GEF develop a co-financing scale for supporting activities identified in the NAPAs, taking into account the circumstances of LDCs; a decision that activities identified in NAPAs that are not supported through full-cost funding as described above will be co-financed through the co-financing scale; a request that SBI 23 review experience gained from the implementation of NAPAs, including those in accessing funds from the LDC Fund; and a decision that COP 14 is to assess progress and consider the adoption of further guidance, as appropriate."
