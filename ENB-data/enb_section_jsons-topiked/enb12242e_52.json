    "This issue was first addressed by SBI in Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June, and subsequently in a contact group chaired by Dechen Tsering (Bhutan).", 
    "The contact group met four times from 18-22 June.", 
    "On Thursday, 24 June, Parties adopted SBI conclusions on the issue. Discussions in the contact group centered on, inter alia: elements of a technical paper on the range and effectiveness of capacity building, including indicators for capacity-building projects; the need for a technical workshop to contribute to the review; and the relevance of National Capacity Self Assessments in assessing capacity needs for climate change. Tanzania, on behalf of the G-77/China, along with the US and Romania, speaking for the economies in transition, expressed concerns at insufficient information provided for the comprehensive review of the implementation of the framework for capacity building in developing countries, and for the compilation and synthesis of capacity-building activities in economies in transition (EITs).", 
    "They argued that further work is needed on the comprehensive review.", 
    "The EU and Japan did not agree with this position.", 
    "Several Parties welcomed a substantive discussion to identify gaps.", 
    "Parties agreed to a meeting of practitioners to contribute to the comprehensive review."
