    "WG III Co-Chair Ottmar Edenhofer reported on a proposal in the WG III progress report (IPCC-XXXII/Doc.12) to hold an expert meeting on geoengineering.", 
    "He said the meeting was meant to respond to the fact that, although geoengineering as a mitigation option remains rather abstract and lacks a comprehensive risk assessment, it is to be assessed by all three WGs in AR5.", 
    "Edenhofer explained the meeting would discuss the scientific basis of geoengineering, its impacts and response options, and identify key knowledge gaps at the meeting.", 
    "India stressed coherence in the treatment of geoengineering and a balanced geographical representation with regards to developed and developing countries.", 
    "Germany called for an expert workshop, not an expert meeting.", 
    "Noting the politically sensitive nature of the topic, the US preferred starting with a smaller meeting instead of a more open and larger workshop.", 
    "Chair Pachauri proposed consultations between the US, Japan and the WG Co-Chairs.", 
    "The issue was not brought back to the plenary."
