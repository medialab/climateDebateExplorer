    "Discussions in other subsidiary bodies are linked to the AGBM and could provide marker of progress and an indicator for future negotiations.", 
    "This round of subsidiary body meetings was marked by a relative absence of science- related disagreements.", 
    "Past SBSTA sessions involved controversies over use of the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR).", 
    "In contrast, during AGBM-6, few if any delegates used scientific uncertainty to buttress their arguments.", 
    "In fact, the EU cited the SAR's results in presenting its proposed 15% emissions reduction target for the year 2010.", 
    "Furthermore, IPCC Chair Bert Bolin created little reaction on the floor in stating that 'no reasonable future reduction by Annex I countries would stabilize global emissions.", 
    "' Absence of a heated science debate and the methodological tasks SBSTA outlined for the work plan indicate that upcoming activities for the scientific community should focus on questions of implementation.", 
    "It remains to be seen, however, what role scientists might play in assessing the impacts of P&M implementation by Annex I countries."
