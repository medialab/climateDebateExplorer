    "On behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), Amb.", 
    "Annette des Iles noted the particular vulnerability of small island States to the consequences of global climate change, as evidenced by the devastation caused by the recent onslaught of storms in the Eastern Caribbean and the Pacific, and the pressing need to take immediate action to deter global warming.", 
    "The Draft Protocol submitted to the Convention by AOSIS in September 1994, which recommended that developed countries reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2005, was not accepted as hoped at COP-1.", 
    "However, AOSIS was pleased with the Berlin Mandate, which notes that current commitments are insufficient to fulfill the mandate of the Convention.", 
    "AOSIS will continue to work with the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate to ensure the adoption of a legal instrument to achieve the additional and necessary commitments called for in the Mandate.", 
    "While the Berlin Mandate is crucial in addressing further commitments beyond the year 2000, it is critical that the current commitments of the Convention be fulfilled, and that the industrialized countries lead the way, as was expressly called for in the Convention.", 
    "The leadership role assigned to the industrialized countries also entails the provision of support and technology to developing countries to better enable them to fulfill their commitments."
