    "COP-6 President Pronk welcomed participants to the ceremonial opening of the High-Level Segment of the conference.", 
    "He said delegates have all the tools needed to complete their work, including a consolidated, unbracketed text he had prepared to facilitate an agreement.", 
    "Emphasizing that the Protocol is 'the only game in town' and that it is fair and credible, he urged Parties not to hold back on ratifying because one nation feels it cannot join. Barbel Dieckmann, Mayor of Bonn, elaborated on the presence of the UNFCCC Secretariat and other UN bodies and agencies in Bonn.", 
    "She outlined plans to continue increasing the UN presence, including plans for a new UN campus. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar recalled the aims of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA), and highlighted the challenges and needs of developing countries in responding to climate change.", 
    "Noting progress in talks during the past few days, he said it would be a waste to 'abandon the investment' of several years of negotiations. Robert Watson, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stated that all the scenarios considered for the next century predict an ongoing increase in carbon dioxide levels, more extreme weather events, temperature increases, changes in precipitation, sea level rise, and impacts on agricultural productivity.", 
    "He noted that cost-effective technologies exist to target greenhouse gas emissions.", 
    "He said the costs of addressing climate change domestically are estimated at 0.2-2 percent of GDP, falling even lower if international cooperation occurs. Representatives of a recent Youth Conference on Climate Change delivered their views.", 
    "One speaker urged delegates not to increase the use of sinks in the Protocol, and said Annex I Parties should meet at least half of their commitments domestically.", 
    "A second speaker told delegates that young people were 'extremely disappointed with your disregard for our future' at The Hague, and urged them not to fail at Bonn. A number of Parties then made general statements.", 
    "IRAN, for the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern with the unilateral approach of the US, and emphasized: preference for three separate decisions on mechanisms; the need to address adverse effects; support for legally binding consequences of non-compliance; and the need for further negotiations on LULUCF.", 
    "BELGIUM, for the EU, said it is ready for compromises with all Parties to reach agreement on a balanced package that respects: environmental integrity; equity and solidarity with developing countries; and economic efficiency and flexibility in meeting the agreed targets.", 
    "SAMOA, for AOSIS, emphasized the need for additional funds to undertake adaptation.", 
    "The CZECH REPUBLIC, for CG-11, expressed concern with the Pronk text on financial obligations for Parties included in Annex I and not included in Annex II, and with proposals for a levy on joint implementation and emissions trading.", 
    "MOROCCO expressed his hope that COP-7 would provide renewed impetus ahead of the Johannesburg 2002 Summit. AUSTRALIA stated that uncertainty regarding future involvement of certain states should not stop key issues from being addressed, and emphasized: the non-discriminatory rules on sinks; a compliance system that assists Parties rather than punishes non- compliance; and the launch of dialogue on action with developing countries.", 
    "CANADA underlined the importance of efficient and accessible market mechanisms, the role of forests and agriculture, and the need to encourage developing country action. Underlining the importance of US participation, JAPAN said she is proactively engaged in consultations with the US, but that this should not delay progress in this session.", 
    "She said JAPAN will exert its utmost efforts to make it possible for many countries, including itself, to conclude the Protocol, aiming at entry into force by 2002.", 
    "The US said it intends to address climate change in a 'serious, sensible and science-based manner' and would not prevent others from going ahead with the Protocol 'so long as they do not harm legitimate US interests.", 
    "' SWITZERLAND, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, said sinks should be of a limited scale, mechanisms should complement domestic action, and there should be a strong compliance regime with legally binding consequences.", 
    "CHINA noted a document outlining its achievements to address climate change.", 
    "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION emphasized the need for simplicity in the mechanisms, including sinks and nuclear, and expressed concern with proposals on financial issues."
