    "Parties agreed to refer the issue to a contact group co-chaired by Sergio Castellari (Italy) and Ermira Fida (Albania).", 
    "The contact group and informal consultations on the issue resulted in agreement on draft conclusions focused on how the SBSTA might facilitate a more effective dialogue between parties and regional and international climate change programmes in the context of Decision 9/CP.11 (research needs relating to the Convention).", 
    "Some areas of divergence arose during the discussions, for instance on text relating to the dialogue's role in identifying gaps in research.", 
    "On Friday, 18 May, Co-Chair Fida reported back to the SBSTA plenary on the group's agreement to continue the dialogue among parties and climate change research programmes, and parties adopted the conclusions as presented."
