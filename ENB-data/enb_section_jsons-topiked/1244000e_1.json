    "The Chair presented his draft conclusions on policies and measures (P&Ms), which represent a streamlined version of Section II of the Framework Compilation on strengthening the commitments in Article 4.2 (a) and (b).", 
    "The draft conclusions contain four elements: proposals regarding policies and measures; general proposals; proposals relevant to the nature and mix of policies and measures; and lists of policies and measures. Proposals regarding policies and measures,' address: adoption of coordinated P&Ms; preparation of National Action Plans; national and regional programmes for climate change mitigation and protection; and enhancement of sinks and reservoirs.", 
    "Some of the entries refer to P&Ms with different priority levels, while others cite specific items such as removal of coal subsidies, technology development and transfer and promotion of renewable energy sources. General proposals' would support: identification of environmental and socio-economic impacts of P&Ms; compatibility between P&Ms and national development programmes; and cost effective P&Ms.", 
    "Some entries in 'Proposals relevant to the nature and mix of policies and measures,' call for individual, rather than coordinated fulfillment of commitments and protection for developing countries, especially oil producing states.", 
    "The section on 'Lists of policies and measures' begins with a proposal from the Chair that contains three lists regarding: policy objectives for all Annex I Parties; possible mechanisms for implementation of P&Ms and a menu of P&Ms from which Parties could choose according to their national circumstances.", 
    "The Chair\u0092s proposal is followed by entries from several countries including Canada, the EU, Switzerland and Japan.", 
    "Each entry contains specific P&Ms. The Chair said some Parties have submitted 'negative' proposals, which note that they object to inclusion of specific issues.", 
    "He proposed including a general chapeau noting their objections and said that all ideas retained in the negotiating text do not have to be included in the Protocol.", 
    "The proposal also contains several symbols and letters and the Chair said values would be attributed to them in future sessions.", 
    "IRAN inquired about the possibility of elaborating on each proposal.", 
    "The Chair noted that other proposals could be submitted later and asked delegates to refrain from making substantive statements. POLAND requested that each reference to a new Annex specify which Parties will be included.", 
    "NEW ZEALAND deleted its proposal calling for compulsory phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA noted its intention to submit a proposal on P&Ms.", 
    "The EU requested that certain P&Ms from its proposed list also be noted in the Chair\u0092s proposed list of P&Ms.", 
    "The EU said it would submit 'List C,' containing P&Ms to be given priority by Parties listed in Annex X as appropriate to national circumstances.", 
    "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION requested retaining its proposals; one which states that a protocol or another legal instrument should not change or replace statements of the Convention, including its principles, and one which states that Parties to the protocol are guided by principles of the Convention. Delegates also commented on the Framework Compilation (FCCC/AGBM/1997/2 and Add.1).", 
    "The EU deleted several paragraphs submitted by its member states because these submissions were superseded by the common EU proposal.", 
    "The Chair noted that a section on education, training and public awareness included in the Addendum would also be included in the negotiating text."
