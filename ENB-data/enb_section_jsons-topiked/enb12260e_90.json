    "The year 2004 was a significant one for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "The year marks the 10th anniversary of the entry into force of the UNFCCC and, as such, many have been looking back with a sense of accomplishment at the progress achieved over the past decade.", 
    "In addition, much of the world celebrated when the Russian Federation ratified the Kyoto Protocol, ensuring the continuity of mitigation efforts into the next decade as the Protocol enters into force in early 2005. To make sure that the 'house' is in order for the Protocol\u0092s imminent entry into force, Parties gathered at COP-10 to complete the unfinished business from the Marrakesh Accords.", 
    "In addition, they took the opportunity to reassess the building blocks of the process and discuss the framing of a new dialogue on the future of climate change policy.", 
    "This brief analysis attempts to review the UNFCCC process as it begins a 'new chapter,' examining the issues of adaptation and mitigation, the needs of least developed countries (LDCs), and future strategies to address climate change."
