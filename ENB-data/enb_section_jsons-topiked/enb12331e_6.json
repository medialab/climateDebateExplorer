    "Discussions continued throughout the afternoon in informal consultations, with delegates addressing both preambular and operative paragraphs of the Co-Chairs' draft COP decision.", 
    "Thelma Krug reported on discussions in a small drafting group held earlier in the day, which resulted in two alternatives for a paragraph on further methodological work: one short option emphasizing a range of actions; and a more elaborate one also addressing policy approaches and positive incentives, referencing emissions levels, and containing a footnote referring to methodological principles of real, demonstrable, transparent, verifiable, results-based, and independently peer-reviewed emissions reductions.", 
    "Parties' views also differed over, inter alia : reference to pilot activities to address drivers of deforestation relevant to national circumstances ; references to Annex II parties in a paragraph inviting parties to mobilize resources; and maintenance and conservation of forest carbon stocks.", 
    "Paragraphs containing these references were bracketed and will be further discussed in informal and drafting consultations on Thursday morning."
