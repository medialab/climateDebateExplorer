    "Many delegates expressed dismay at protests within the conference center by a group of 30 or more activists Wednesday afternoon.", 
    "The protests disrupted a closed session of the high-level informal negotiations, and culminated in an assault on senior US negotiator Frank Loy during a press conference, leaving him covered in cream cake.", 
    "In addition, minor damage to property and several small fires were reported within the center. While several participants thought the protests might remind delegates of the urgency and sense of impatience on the issues at stake, some thought the near-violent nature of the incident and the unruly behavior of the demonstrators might undermine broader participation by NGOs, and only served to disrupt negotiations. Meanwhile, the substantive discussions showed signs of movement, as both multilateral and bilateral discussions moved up a gear.", 
    "Several observers reported a softening on the EU position on several issues, including supplementarity and share of proceeds.", 
    "In addition, there was talk of one Umbrella Group member taking a softer line on supplementarity, in return for flexibility on LULUCF."
