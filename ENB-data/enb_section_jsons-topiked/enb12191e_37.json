    "On Thursday morning, 25 April, participants met in three parallel working groups with the aim of developing recommendations on methods and tools for assessing technology needs, as well as recommendations on the types of assistance required to carry out technology needs assessments.", 
    "The three working groups, which each had the same mandate and goals, were convened in order to provide an informal, small-group setting designed to allow all participants to provide input on the development of these recommendations. The working groups considered four questions designed to help guide them in formulating their ideas and recommendations: Are the existing methodologies for needs assessments adequate and, if not, how can they be improved?", 
    "What are the potential barriers in technology needs assessments and what specific actions can be taken to overcome these barriers?", 
    "What capacity building and technical assistance is needed to undertake needs assessments?", 
    "What possible follow-up activities can be pursued related to needs assessments?", 
    "The working groups were chaired by Anthony Olusegun Adegbulugbe (Nigeria), William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) and Javier Hanna Figueroa (Bolivia).", 
    "Each group also appointed a rapporteur to report back to the Plenary with their findings."
