    "The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).", 
    "Its purpose is to assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the risks associated with human-induced climate change, its potential impacts, and options for adaptation and mitigation.", 
    "The IPCC does not undertake new research, nor does it monitor climate-related data.", 
    "Instead, it conducts assessments of knowledge on the basis of published and peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature.", 
    "The IPCC has three working groups: WGI addresses the scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change; WGII addresses the vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change, impacts of climate change and adaptation options; and WGIII addresses options for limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigating climate change.", 
    "Each working group has two Co-Chairs and six Vice-Chairs, except WGIII, which, for the Fifth Assessment cycle, has three Co-Chairs.", 
    "The Co-Chairs guide the WGs in fulfilling the mandates given to them by the Panel and are assisted in this task by Technical Support Units (TSUs).", 
    "The IPCC also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI).", 
    "The TFI oversees the IPCC National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme, which aims to develop and refine an internationally agreed methodology and software for the calculation and reporting of national GHG emissions and removals, and to encourage the use of this methodology by parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).", 
    "The IPCC Bureau is elected by the Panel for the duration of the preparation of an IPCC assessment report (approximately six years).", 
    "Its role is to assist the IPCC Chair in planning, coordinating and monitoring the work of the IPCC.", 
    "The Bureau is composed of climate change experts representing all regions.", 
    "Currently, the Bureau comprises 31 members: the Chair of the IPCC, the IPCC Vice-Chairs, the Co-Chairs of the three WGs and the Bureau of the TFI (TFB), and the Vice-Chairs of the three WGs.", 
    "In addition to the Bureau, in 2011 the IPCC established an Executive Committee to assist with intersessional work and coordination among WGs.", 
    "The Committee consists of the IPCC Chair, IPCC Vice-Chairs, WG and TFB Co-Chairs and advisory members, which include the Head of the Secretariat and four Heads of TSUs.", 
    "The IPCC Secretariat is located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is hosted by the WMO."
