    "Those delegates focused on the present seemed convinced that tackling technical tasks should be the main priority at SB-16.", 
    "They felt that the meetings\u0092 mandate was to agree on process, rather than address the 'substantive' issues of wider implementation.", 
    "They argued that now is not the time to push too hard on longer-term issues, given the current climate of uncertainty over entry into force of the Protocol, and the apparent lack of political momentum for going beyond what was agreed at Marrakesh.", 
    "These delegates, from both North and South, felt that 'tinkering' with technical matters would be more pragmatic than pushing prematurely for greater gains, which could possibly further entrench positions. This attitude was certainly reflected in the agenda, which included many technical and methodological issues, such as guidelines on greenhouse gas inventories, the revised uniform reporting format on AIJ in the pilot phase, terms of reference for workshops, and guidance to new specialist bodies like the Expert Group on Technology Transfer.", 
    "Advocates of this perspective justified their approach by noting constructive discussions and visible outcomes in the groups considering these matters."
