    "Joint climate mitigation activities between parties were envisaged under Convention Article 4.2, and a pilot phase for AIJ was agreed at COP 1 in 1995 to give interested parties experience in the joint implementation of projects.", 
    "Unlike the Protocol s flexible mechanisms, however, AIJ pilot phase activities do not result in credits for parties.", 
    "At COP 12, parties agreed to continue the pilot phase, and to consider the eighth synthesis report of submissions at SBSTA 29.", 
    "However, because no new information on AIJ projects was received, the Secretariat did not produce a synthesis report.", 
    "As a result, SBSTA 29 decided to change the deadline for the eighth synthesis, and on 12 December the COP adopted a short decision text confirming this recommendation."
