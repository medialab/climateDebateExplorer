    "On Tuesday morning, participants reconvened for the final part of the in-session workshop on the scale of Annex I parties emission reductions, which had started on Monday afternoon.", 
    "Discussions continued on: the quantitative implications of the use of LULUCF, emission trading and project based mechanisms on the emission reductions by Annex I parties; national circumstances; and their implications on emission reductions by Annex I parties. CHINA expressed concern with discussing developing and developed countries together and at creating a common space, which she said was already established by the Convention and Protocol.", 
    "In response to questions about AAU demand, POINT CARBON said she assumed a very low surplus AAU demand, due to both transaction costs and preference for CERs from pure project-based mechanisms.", 
    "THIRD WORLD NETWORK noted that emission reductions loopholes should be addressed to ensure the level of ambition required by science.", 
    "She also expressed concern with non-additionality issues under CDM accounting and that the current proposed scale of offsets allows developed countries to shift the mitigation burden to developing countries."
