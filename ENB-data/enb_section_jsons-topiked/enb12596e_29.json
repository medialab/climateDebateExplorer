    "The underlying assessment and the SPM were accepted by WGII without discussion.", 
    "China expressed concern with misrepresentations concerning China's autonomous regions, autonomous provinces and administrative regions, and the use of controversial maps.", 
    "Noting that this concern remained unaddressed despite China having communicated it to the WG, he called for inserting language indicating that maps contained in the report are for geographical reference only and urged that these problems be addressed in the final version of the WGII report. IPCC Secretary Renate Christ explained that the Secretariat was awaiting advice from the UN Secretariat on this issue and highlighted the inclusion in the SPM of the UN standard disclaimer noting that the designations quoted do not imply endorsement."
