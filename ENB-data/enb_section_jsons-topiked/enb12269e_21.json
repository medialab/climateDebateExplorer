    "Delegates seemed relieved at the completion of most of SBI\u0092s work late on Thursday night, although not everyone was celebrating.", 
    "With agreement on the programme budget for 2006-2007 still elusive as of 12:30 am Friday morning, some delegates left the meeting clearly frustrated.", 
    "On the other hand, celebrations at a final agreement on a decision on LDCs appeared genuine, although tempered by a few comments that the result was not as strong as some would have liked.", 
    "There also seemed to be real satisfaction at the significant step towards concluding work on another longstanding agenda item relating to Croatia\u0092s base year emissions.", 
    "However, frustrations were evident in some quarters over the short text on several issues, such as mitigation and climate neutral UNFCCC meetings."
