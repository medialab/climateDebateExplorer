    "As described by one observer, Tuesday was clearly the 'day of the brackets' with numerous bracketed draft decisions left unfinished and being forwarded by SBSTA and SBI directly to the COP Presidency that has already begun informal senior-level discussions.", 
    "Exhausted delegates in the corridors remarked upon the unusual approach taken by the SBI and SBSTA, in limiting strictly the time allowed for discussion on issues that were near completion.", 
    "In particular, observers pointed out that the issues of the financial mechanism and the LDCs could have completed their work, noting that with three days to go, sufficient time could have been found. Delegates also expressed their disappointment at the renegotiation of terms of the LDC Fund, meaning that progress made at COP-9 on funding for adaptation is essentially negligible.", 
    "Meanwhile, closure of SBSTA was held up for hours by insistence by the Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia that their proposals on adaptation be reflected in the draft conclusions, generating speculation about the motivation for the Russian objection."
