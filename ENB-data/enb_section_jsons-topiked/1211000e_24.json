    "There was extensive debate on the review of Annex I Parties' national communications.", 
    "Developing countries expressed disappointment with the 15 submissions to date stating that many lacked adequate documentation and evaluation of policies.", 
    "The key points of disagreement among developed countries were the periodicity of emissions inventory updates, which GHGs should be inventoried, and whether the Parties should be named in the synthesis report.", 
    "Some Annex I Parties argued for annual C02 emissions inventory updates with the optional inclusion of other GHGs, others argued for the inclusion of all GHGs, requested flexibility on submissions and did not support naming Parties, while still others argued that the synthesis report indicated that more action was needed to meet the Convention\u0092s objectives.", 
    "A few developed countries urged the development of guidelines for national communications from developing country Parties.", 
    "Developing countries warned again that this should not become a means of imposing new commitments on non-Annex I Parties."
