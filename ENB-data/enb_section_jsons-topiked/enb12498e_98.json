    "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2010/ L.18), the SBSTA agrees that in the revised UNFCCC Annex I reporting guidelines, the agriculture and LULUCF sectors should continue to be separate as in the current UNFCCC Annex I reporting guidelines.", 
    "The SBSTA further agrees that separate reporting of agriculture and LULUCF requires an allocation of the agriculture, forests and other land uses categories in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines to the agriculture and LULUCF sectors with a view to ensuring completeness and avoiding duplication of reporting of individual categories and/or sub-categories.", 
    "The SBSTA also agrees that this may include revisiting the allocation of categories in the current UNFCCC Annex I reporting guidelines.", 
    "The SBSTA requests the Secretariat to organize a third workshop under the work programme, to be held in early 2011, and a fourth workshop in the second half of 2011.", 
    "Greenhouse gas data interface: The Secretariat reported on the development of the greenhouse gas data interface.", 
    "The SBSTA took note of the information and agreed to continue consideration of the issue at SBSTA 34."
