    "Delegates met informally in the morning to consider the draft text, agreeing on the workshop objective of increasing understanding of carbon dioxide capture and storage and covering the relevant provisions of the forthcoming 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.", 
    "In the afternoon, the contact group reconvened and delegates agreed on draft text which, inter alia: notes the IPCC\u0092s assessment of carbon dioxide capture and storage and encourages Parties and the private sector to support related research, development, deployment and diffusion of such technologies; sets out the workshop\u0092s objectives and reporting; and requests the GEF to consider whether supporting carbon dioxide capture and storage, particularly through capacity building, is consistent with its objectives.", 
    "The contact group concluded its work early Saturday evening."
