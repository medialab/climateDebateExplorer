    "This issue was first addressed in SBSTA plenary on Thursday, 19 May, and then in two contact group meetings co-chaired by Mar\u00eda Paz Cigar\u00e1n (Peru) and Sergio Castellari (Italy).", 
    "The conclusions aim to establish a dialogue between SBSTA and research programmes and institutions at the national, regional and international level. Discussions in the plenary focused on two main themes: the need to increase the capacity of developing countries to contribute to climate change efforts, including greater involvement from experts from developing countries; and whether or not SBSTA should provide direction to the IPCC on research.", 
    "Switzerland and Australia noted the need to avoid duplication of IPCC efforts.", 
    "The EU, opposed by Kenya, proposed a draft study to identify key policy-relevant research issues to be communicated to the research community."
