    "Several delegates supported the continuation of the current structure of the Bureau.", 
    "Some participants called for more transparency in the selection of the Bureau.", 
    "Noting that the current composition is based on regional representation, one participant questioned whether the Bureau members actually consulted with their constituencies, and suggested that by doing so, all delegates would feel a greater sense of ownership with regard to actions by the Bureau.", 
    "Participants expressed differing views on the size of the Bureau, ranging from suggestions to expand it, to reduce the members, and to have a rotating membership basis.", 
    "Participants highlighted the need for a regional balance within the bureaus of each working group."
