    "The Joint Working Group on Compliance made steady progress, producing a streamlined text for further negotiation, and winning the Group kudos for its work.", 
    "However, fundamental issues remain unresolved.", 
    "It remains unclear whether the compliance system will apply only to Protocol commitments or also to commitments 'referred to' in the Protocol (namely FCCC commitments), whether the compliance system can apply to outcomes with binding consequences, and whether the compliance committee will have equal representation from the five UN regional groups or predominantly from Annex I countries.", 
    "The work in the compliance group is intricately linked both to the work in the mechanisms group and to the group on Articles 5,7 and 8.", 
    "The stronger the compliance system, the more ambiguous the provisions relating to the mechanisms are likely to be, and vice versa.", 
    "The work of the Article 5,7 and 8 group feeds into the compliance group.", 
    "While most of the technical issues are easy to settle, certain issues such as those relating to the determination of the entity charged with identifying first order compliance problems and the composition of Expert Review Teams are seen as more controversial.", 
    "No decisions will be taken in any one of these groups without clear reference, both technical and political, to the work of the other groups."
