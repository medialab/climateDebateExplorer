    "Informal consultations on national communications from non-Annex I Parties (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.27) were convened in the morning and evening to discuss a draft decision.", 
    "The EU, US, CANADA, JAPAN and AUSTRALIA proposed text stating that non-Annex I Parties would make all efforts to submit their second and, where appropriate, third national communications, within four years of the initial financing, on an agreed full cost basis 'for the three year project preparation period.", 
    "' They also proposed that, if necessary, non-Annex I Parties could have a one-year extension for submission.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA, questioned by some GEF donor countries, argued that there was no basis for stipulating the three-year period for the preparation of second or third communications.", 
    "The US noted that donor countries do not wish to increase their funding of this activity. A proposal that any extension of the submission period should not imply additional financial resources from the GEF was qualified by the G-77/CHINA, which sought to stipulate a submission period of four years.", 
    "However, there was no agreement on this.", 
    "Consultations may reconvene on Wednesday morning after talks with the SBI Chair."
