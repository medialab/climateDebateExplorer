    "Chair Diouf recalled the AWG-KP s mandate to conclude its work by CMP 8 and identified issues for consideration to fulfill its mandate.", 
    "These include QELROs (FCCC/KP/AWG/2012/MISC.1 and Add.1), carry-over of AAUs and proposed amendments to the Protocol, including the length of the second commitment period.", 
    "Parties agreed to establish a contact group on Annex I further commitments, co-chaired by Chair Diouf and Vice-Chair Uosukainen.", 
    "A spin-off group was subsequently created, focusing on numbers and text.", 
    "It was co-facilitated by J\u00fcrgen Lefevere (EU) and Sandea de Wet (South Africa), later replaced by Harald Winkler (South Africa), following de Wet s appointment as the interim ADP Chair.", 
    "Legal and procedural issues were considered in informal consultations facilitated by Vice-Chair Uosukainen.", 
    "Numbers/Text: On this issue (FCCC/KP/AWG/2012/MISC.1 and Add.1), parties considered a number of proposals, and inter alia : heard presentations on the parties QELROs submissions; discussed the level of ambition of parties commitments and carry-over of surplus AAUs; and reviewed options for addressing the carry-over of surplus AAUs from the first to the second commitment period.", 
    "On QELROs , parties received information from Switzerland, Norway, Kazakhstan, the EU, AOSIS, Belarus, Australia, and Croatia regarding, inter alia : clarifications on QELROs submissions and associated conditions; views on market mechanisms; national policies implemented to support QELROs; and preferences for the length of the second commitment period.", 
    "On ambition , the EU introduced two proposals.", 
    "The first one would establish a review of the level of ambition of parties QELROs, coinciding with the 2013-2015 Review under the Convention, to address the concern raised by some parties that an eight-year commitment period would lock in a low level of ambition.", 
    "The second one includes a simplified procedure to amend Protocol Annex B to facilitate an increase in the level of ambition by parties.", 
    "Brazil introduced a proposal on revising QELROs with a view to strengthening commitments under the Protocol.", 
    "The proposal indicates that Annex I parties may, at any time, strengthen their QELROs and ensure the immediate effect of such revision by: forfeiting a part of their AAUs; transferring these units to a cancellation account established for this purpose in the national registry; and communicating such transfer to the Secretariat.", 
    "On carry-over of surplus AAUs, the African Group, AOSIS, and Brazil offered proposals and presentations.", 
    "The African Group proposal states, inter alia , that surplus AAUs can be carried over but placed in a special reserve, provided that the party is participating in the second commitment period and the party s QELRO is lower than its 2008 greenhouse gas inventory.", 
    "In addition, the proposal permits parties to trade 2% of the reserve per year with 1% of the revenue to be spent on domestic mitigation and 1% of AAUs to be transferred to the Adaptation Fund.", 
    "The AOSIS proposal states that, inter alia , the total quantity of AAUs, Certified Emission Reductions and Emission Reduction Units approved for carry-over, and carried over from the previous commitment period, shall be deemed a party s previous period surplus reserve.", 
    "It also states that after the end of the subsequent commitment period, a party may use any carried over units up to a specified quantity.", 
    "The Brazilian proposal contains various paragraphs, which state that, inter alia , if the emissions of an Annex I party in a commitment period are less than its assigned amount under this article, the difference shall, on request of that party, be carried over to the subsequent commitment period.", 
    "It alternatively states that if the assigned amount of an Annex I party included for the first commitment period is less than that party s emissions in 2007 multiplied by five, the difference between the assigned amount for that party for the first commitment period and its emissions in 2012 multiplied by five shall be deemed the previous period surplus reserve.", 
    "Legal issues: During informal consultations facilitated by Vice-Chair Uosukainen, parties considered legal aspects of the entry into force of the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "Issues discussed included: how to secure continuity between the first and second commitment periods; the application of accounting rules in the second commitment period; options for provisional application of Protocol amendments to secure continuity pending their entry into force; and ways to raise ambition levels during the second commitment period.", 
    "Parties also considered an AOSIS proposal relating to provisional application of the Protocol amendment, an AOSIS proposal for amendments and an African Groups proposal on legal issues.", 
    "Many parties stressed the need for clarity on legal issues to ensure a seamless continuation of the Protocol beyond 2012.", 
    "Enhanced clarity on parties positions was noted, as well as a large amount of work remaining before a successful outcome in Doha can be reached."
