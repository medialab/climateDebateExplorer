    "Delegates were celebrating in several contact groups Wednesday at the completion of their work.", 
    "In particular, the conclusion of discussions on non-Annex I Parties\u0092 submissions of national communications, which have been under negotiation for two and a half years, resulted in 'a collective sigh of relief,' according to one observer. Meanwhile the decision to forward ongoing debates over the Special Climate Change Fund to Montreal was a sign of SB 22\u0092s 'technical' and 'low key' nature, according to several participants.", 
    "'At this stage, anything remotely political or problematic will likely end up on the COP or COP/MOP\u0092s plate,' said one delegate."
