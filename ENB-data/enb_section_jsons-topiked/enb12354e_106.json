    "Parties spent most of the meeting discussing specific issues relating to the AWG's work programme and the agreed text contains a detailed outline for AWG's activities and meetings for 2008-2009.", 
    "Several Annex I countries stressed the connection between the AWG and other post-2012 processes and the need to coordinate them.", 
    "South Africa, for the G-77/China, accepted the need to avoid duplicative work but highlighted the AWG's limited mandate and opposed any formal links to other post-2012 processes.", 
    "Delegates agreed to request the Secretariat to schedule the AWG's meetings to the extent possible, with other UNFCCC meetings.", 
    "The G-77/China also stressed that the AWG should agree to complete its work in 2009.", 
    "In the final document, the AWG indicates that it aims to forward relevant decisions on Annex I future commitments for adoption by COP/MOP 5, to be held in 2009.", 
    "The final issue to be resolved concerned two options for a paragraph indicating that the AWG's work should be guided by a shared vision of the Convention's ultimate objective.", 
    "The first option, supported by Canada, the Russian Federation and initially some G-77/China countries, referred only to the relevant paragraph numbers in the report of the first part of AWG 4 (FCCC/KP/AWG/2007/L.3).", 
    "The second option, proposed by the EU, spelled out these findings.", 
    "It referred to the AR4 and the need for global emissions to peak within the next 10-15 years and be reduced well below 2000 levels by the middle of the century.", 
    "It also indicated that Annex I parties as a group would need to reduce their emissions by 25-40% from 1990 levels by 2020.", 
    "During the AWG's closing plenary on Saturday evening, 15 December, the G-77/China, EU, LDCs, SIDS, New Zealand, Switzerland and several others supported AWG Vice-Chair Bergh\u00e4ll's proposal to approve the second option.", 
    "Only Canada and the Russian Federation opposed it, with Canada objecting to a reference to only some parts of the AR4 and the Russian Federation preferring to refer specifically to Working Group III's contribution to AR4, since this was where this text originally came from.", 
    "The AWG agreed on the second option and added reference to the contribution of IPCC Working Group III to the AR4 and a footnote referring to Working Group III's Technical Summary."
