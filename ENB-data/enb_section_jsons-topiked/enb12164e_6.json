    "Several informal meetings and consultations were held following SB-13.", 
    "These included consultations on Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information), land-use, land-use change and forestry, compliance, mechanisms, adverse effects, and least developed countries (LDCs), as well as informal high-level consultations held in early October and chaired by Jan Pronk, the Dutch Environment Minister and President-designate of COP-6.", 
    "These meetings resulted in some further progress.", 
    "However, with such a complex array of political and technical issues on the table and an emphasis on achieving agreement on the entire 'package' of issues under negotiation, many observers prior to COP-6 suggested that accommodating all countries' interests and aims could prove difficult."
