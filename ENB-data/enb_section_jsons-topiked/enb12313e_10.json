    "Parties discussed a Chair's draft text on the implications of establishing new HCFC-22 facilities seeking to obtain certified emission reductions ( CERs ) for destroying HFC-23.", 
    "Regarding institutional arrangements on CER issuance, one large developing country, opposed by several parties, preferred a reference to CERs being issued to the host government rather than to another institution.", 
    "There was also disagreement over what happens with remaining CERs left over after certain costs are met, with some developing countries preferring that these CERs be cancelled, while another wanted these to be used to benefit the global environment. REVIEW OF THE PROTOCOL (ARTICLE 9): Bilateral consultations were conducted by Fernando Tudela Abad (Mexico) aimed at considering views on how to proceed."
