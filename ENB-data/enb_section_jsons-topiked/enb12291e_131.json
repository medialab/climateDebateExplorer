    "As the conference closed on Saturday morning, many delegates and civil society representatives appeared satisfied that they had overcome so many potential pitfalls and actually achieved consensus.", 
    "However, the simple fact that delegates agreed to embark on several processes does not indicate the substance of a future agreement.", 
    "It is one thing to make progress, but quite another to achieve long-term success. Some may argue that President Dion was able to achieve his objectives by setting the bar low enough that a positive outcome was almost assured.", 
    "After all, many of the major battles over the implementation of the Protocol were fought in 2001.", 
    "It could also be argued that the decisions on post-2012 were not sufficiently specific to guarantee a positive outcome in the long-term. However, most delegates leaving the Palais des congr\u00e8s de Montr\u00e9al on Saturday morning would say such criticisms are unjustified.", 
    "Even several veterans of the process seemed to be in a state of mild euphoria as the meeting ended.", 
    "While these three parallel processes may not commit parties to take any definite action, agreeing to discuss the future under both the Protocol and the Convention was more than many felt was achievable at this time."
