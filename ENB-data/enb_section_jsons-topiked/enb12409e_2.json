    "In December 1997, delegates to the third session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 3) met in Kyoto, Japan, and adopted the Kyoto Protocol, which commits developed countries and countries making the transition to a market economy to achieve quantified reduction targets for their greenhouse gas emissions.", 
    "These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties , agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.", 
    "The Protocol also establishes three flexible mechanisms to assist Annex I Parties in meeting their targets: an emissions trading system; joint implementation of emissions reduction projects between Annex I Parties ; and the Clean Development Mechanism, which allows for projects to be implemented in non-Annex I Parties .", 
    "To date, there are 184 parties to the Kyoto Protocol, which entered into force on 16 February 2005."
