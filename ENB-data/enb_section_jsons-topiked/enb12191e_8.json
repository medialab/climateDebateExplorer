    "Following these presentations, Chair Thorgeirsson invited two discussants, Rawleston Moore (Barbados) and J\u00f8rgen Fenhann (UNEP-Risoe), to comment on the working paper.", 
    "Rawleston Moore said the paper made it clear that no one methodology would fit the unique circumstances of all countries.", 
    "He highlighted concerns about how to overcome barriers to progress on this issue and how to integrate assessment concerns in the wider context of Agenda 21.", 
    "He suggested that more information on the costs associated with the different stages of needs assessments would be of value.", 
    "In response, Zou Ji indicated that costs were hard to determine, although it was likely that major costs might be incurred at the survey stage. J\u00f8rgen Fenhann said that although technology needs assessment was a fairly new concept, it was not necessary to start afresh on this issue, as there was already a great deal of relevant information and experience that could be built on in developing relevant methodologies.", 
    "He drew attention to the paper\u0092s treatment of both 'soft' and 'hard' technologies, and its reference to both mitigation and adaptation technologies.", 
    "He identified the challenge of turning the existing theory on technology transfer into a reality, cautioning that the 'devil is in the details."
