    "Delegates at IPCC-25 were in good spirits on Wednesday, despite having an ambitious agenda to get through and a number of potential pitfalls in the way.", 
    "Newcomers to the process may have felt that progress in plenary was slow going, but veteran observers were more sanguine.", 
    "One observer\u0092s prediction that the meeting would include the 'usual mischief making' seemed well placed, as discussions on the 2006 Guidelines were held up on a couple of technical and procedural issues.", 
    "Progress was also protracted, as several participants expected, on flooded lands. With only one day of the meeting gone, the mood at the close of the session remained upbeat, even though many delegates had to forgo the evening reception to continue contact group discussions, and many were scheduled to return early on Thursday morning for more of the same.", 
    "Several delegates were optimistic that momentum would increase over the next two days."
