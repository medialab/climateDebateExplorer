    "Delegates discussed guidance to the GEF on the LDC Fund and the LDC Expert Group (LEG).", 
    "CANADA commended the LEG\u0092s work, and TANZANIA, for the LDCs, proposed extending the LEG\u0092s mandate to support the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs).", 
    "On guidance to the GEF, LDCs, SAMOA and MALAWI expressed concern over co-financing requirements, noting that decision 6/CP.9 (guidance on the operation of the LDC Fund) provides for full funding of NAPAs.", 
    "The GEF said that, since decision 6/CP.9 requires the GEF to develop criteria for full funding, some activities would qualify for full funding, while others would build on existing development projects and require co-financing from other sources, or in-kind contributions by recipient governments.", 
    "The EU said co-financing emphasizes countries\u0092 sense of ownership over projects."
