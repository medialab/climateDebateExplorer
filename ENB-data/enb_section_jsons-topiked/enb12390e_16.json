    "On another day full of informal consultations and contact groups, some observers were commenting on what they saw as an apparent lack of urgency.", 
    "We re all busy, but I don t hear many people acknowledging the sheer magnitude of our task over the next year, or worrying about the closing window of opportunity here in Pozna\u00c5\u0084, said a delegate.", 
    "This is the last COP before Copenhagen, and we re already halfway through, with little achieved, said another.",

    "This sentiment appeared to be reflected in the AWG-LCA discussions, where some were complaining about a lack of discussion on existing proposals and too many general statements.", 
    "Meanwhile, many participants were still fretting about the duplication of work under different negotiating groups.", 
    "The flexible mechanisms, for instance, were discussed on Friday in the CDM, JI, AWG-KP and Article 9 review groups.",
