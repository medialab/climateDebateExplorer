    "As the first half of negotiations drew to a close, most parties were disheartened, expressing dissatisfaction with the slow pace of talks, especially under the AWG-LCA.", 
    "Some delegates were confused as to why there had been controversy over the establishment of the contact groups and were distinctly unhappy about the resulting delay in their work.", 
    "In the words of one party, I would have preferred heading out to enjoy my one day off feeling like we had achieved more.", 
    "Following the AWG-LCA mitigation contact group, one delegate observed that diplomacy had been abandoned and that the negotiators seemed more interested in attacking one another than in trying to come forward with ways of taking the process forward.", 
    "The participants in the AWG-LCA adaptation contact group, however, were considerably happier, with the general feeling that some progress had been made, pointing to the development of concrete proposals, such as that of the African Group.", 
    "Yet, many noted that there was still a grave problem in moving from planning to implementation, citing the many NAPA submissions and project proposals with little funding to facilitate action."
