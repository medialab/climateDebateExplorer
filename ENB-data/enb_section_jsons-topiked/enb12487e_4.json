    "For the AWG-LCA, the first part of 2009 focused on developing draft negotiating text.", 
    "This process resulted in a text that was nearly 200 pages long and covered all the main elements of the BAP.", 
    "Because of the length of the text, delegates began producing non-papers, reading guides, tables and matrices aimed at making the negotiating text more manageable.", 
    "The outcome was a series of non-papers, forwarded to Copenhagen as an annex to the meeting report.", 
    "Heading into Copenhagen, many felt the AWG-LCA had made satisfactory progress on adaptation, technology and capacity building, but that deep divides remained on mitigation and certain aspects of finance."
