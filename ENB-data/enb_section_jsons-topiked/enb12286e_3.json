    "CDM Executive Board Chair Sushma Gera highlighted concerns among members and experts of constituted bodies under the Kyoto Protocol about the potential risks of legal action, noting that individuals are not covered by the relevant UN instruments, although the UNFCCC Headquarters Agreement with the German Government could afford protection, at least in Germany.", 
    "However, she added that concerns about broader liability are affecting the Board\u0092s deliberations. Parties emphasized that members and experts serving on bodies under the Protocol should be able to carry out their tasks free from the threat of third party claims.", 
    "Delegates also discussed options for addressing this concern, as set out in a note by the Secretariat (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/6).", 
    "Several Parties, including the EU and SOUTH AFRICA, said it would not be possible to achieve a final resolution on this issue at COP/MOP 1, and the EU presented an assessment of all the options.", 
    "Parties also discussed whether an 'interim measure' could provide some additional security until a final arrangement was implemented.", 
    "Discussions will resume on Monday afternoon."
