    "The first reading of section H (Capacity-building), containing six paragraphs in the Geneva negotiating text, was conducted in the negotiating group chaired by Co-Chair Djoghlaf on Tuesday, 2 June. Parties discussed a consolidation proposal by the Secretariat and considered consolidating text in three paragraphs.", 
    "An informal facilitated discussion group, co-facilitated by Artur Runge-Metzger (EU) and Tosi Mpanu Mpanu (the Democratic Republic of the Congo), agreed to the consolidation proposals.", 
    "A summary of the discussions on specific paragraphs is available at: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12630e.html A second reading of the text was undertaken in the facilitated group on 4 and 5 June.", 
    "Going through the section paragraph-by-paragraph, parties identified paragraphs for streamlining and unpacking, and engaged in conceptual discussions on institutional arrangements for capacity building. On Friday, 5 June, Co-Facilitator Runge-Metzger explained the group had progressed as far as possible on streamlining and structuring the text of the section.", 
    "Parties initiated a conceptual discussion to clarify parties\u2019 views on gaps in existing mechanisms, and the need for a new capacity-building institution. Conceptual discussions, which continued on Monday and Tuesday, 8 and 9 June, addressed: gaps in the work of, and strengthening and improving, existing institutions; and the structure and function of, and rationale for, establishing a capacity-building mechanism. Jamaica identified gaps in reporting on capacity-building activities and said CTCN efforts are focused on building capacity to participate in the CTCN.", 
    "Burundi noted a lack of coordination among Convention bodies with a capacity-building component.", 
    "Malaysia suggested that developing countries\u2019 capacity has mainly been enhanced with respect to reporting requirements. The US identified the TEC, the CTCN and the Climate Technology Initiative Private Financing Advisory Network as means for capacity building.", 
    "Saint Lucia and others said capacity building goes beyond technical aspects.", 
    "Swaziland noted the mandate of the Technology Mechanism from Cancun does not match with that proposed in the text.", 
    "Australia suggested national climate change capacity-building plans for articulating countries\u2019 needs. The EU called for exploring: why existing bodies are \u201cnot delivering\u201d on capacity building; ways to enhance collaboration between existing bodies; and how to strengthen the Durban Forum on Capacity-building. Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Burundi and Senegal called for a governing body to coordinate capacity-building efforts, with Senegal emphasizing MRV of support to developing countries.", 
    "The EU questioned the ability of such a body to address the identified gaps. China, for the G-77/China, with many developing countries, called for a capacity-building body or center to, inter alia: provide a more structured and holistic approach to capacity building; analyze gaps in, and support implementation of, activities; monitor implementation; increase coherence and synergies among activities; publicize financing opportunities; assist the LDCs in building climate resilience; and support country-driven actions. The US enquired how such an institution would coordinate all capacity-building activities globally, and recalled a previous discussion on MRV of support had indicated difficulties in measuring capacity-building support. Discussions also examined linkages with related work under the SBI, including on the third comprehensive review of the implementation of the framework for capacity building.", 
    "Parties agreed on the need for capacity building to be at the core of the Paris agreement. During the final facilitated group session, parties suggested as next steps: clarification of parties\u2019 views on text options and sequencing; a third iteration of the text; holding a workshop; and a list by the Secretariat of existing institutions working on capacity building."
