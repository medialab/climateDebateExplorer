    "Co-Chair Slade suggested that delegates focus on five issues: consequences applied by the enforcement branch; composition; appeal; relationship between the Compliance Committee and the COP/MOP; and principles.", 
    "Developing countries also stated that unresolved matters include the operation of the facilitative branch, as proposed in Pronk's text. On consequences, delegates discussed their nature and whether they would be legally binding.", 
    "A group of Annex I Parties favored a legally binding system with 'rather tough' consequences to deter Parties from becoming free-riders.", 
    "Non-Annex I countries, with others, said legally binding consequences are necessary to address legally binding commitments.", 
    "They said the consequences should be tailored to achieve three objectives: deterrence, restoration, and ensuring that Parties continue meeting their responsibilities over the next commitment periods.", 
    "Some developed countries supported politically-agreed consequences of a non-punitive nature, while others favored a legally binding regime with a facilitative, non- punitive approach.", 
    "One delegate explained that what is 'punitive' reflects Parties' own perceptions of consequences.", 
    "One developed country, opposed by several developing countries, argued against restricting the right to transfer assigned amount units, and suggested that the restoration rate of excess tonnes be one for one.", 
    "A consultation group, chaired by Jos\u00e9 Romero (Switzerland), was established to follow up on this matter.", 
    "This group met from late afternoon, and established a list of unresolved issues with possible options for consideration by Ministers.", 
    "It will report back to the Co-Chairs by Wednesday, 17 July, 12:00 pm. On the composition of compliance bodies, numerous Parties opposed the single type of formula proposed in Pronk's text.", 
    "Developing country Parties said the composition criterion should be the equitable geographic representation of the five UN regional groupings, taking into account the interest groups as reflected by the current practice in the UNFCCC Bureau.", 
    "One developing country explained that this composition would reflect the fact that the whole community of states had an interest in ensuring compliance.", 
    "A number of Annex I Parties said the composition should be tailored to the mandate of the branch and to the type of commitments under consideration.", 
    "One developed country suggested that, given the quasi-judicial functions of the enforcement branch, there was a very strong case to move away from drawing analogies with political bodies, and that only Annex I Parties should sit on this branch.", 
    "Another developed country said it would submit a proposal on this issue at a later stage. On principles, non-Annex I Parties expressed their opposition to the approach taken in the Pronk text.", 
    "They said the facilitative branch should treat Annex I and non-Annex I Parties differently and apply different consequences to these two groups.", 
    "A number of Annex I Parties supported Pronk's text, with some arguing that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities does not only apply between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. On appeal, delegates expressed diverging views.", 
    "On the relationship between the Compliance Committee and the COP/MOP, developing countries said the issue was closely related to the possibility of an appeal and of a panel to consider the reports of experts review teams."
