    "SBSTA Chair Tibor Farag\u00f3 (Hungary) opened SBSTA-6 on 28 July and highlighted the interest in enhancing commitments under the FCCC as expressed at UNGASS.", 
    "He noted that Burundi had recently become an FCCC Party and said the Ukraine and Singapore would soon follow.", 
    "FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit-Cutajar noted that while much attention has focused on the AGBM, the other subsidiary bodies would also make positive contributions to COP-3.", 
    "He expressed concern at the slow pace of submission of national communications, which are a basic commitment and affect the Secretariat\u0092s ability to compile and synthesize information. On the adoption of the agenda, the G-77/CHINA, reserved its position on addressing methodological issues related to joint implementation as a separate issue.", 
    "CHINA proposed bracketing the item.", 
    "The US requested an explanation of this action.", 
    "The Chair proposed including this item under the general discussion on activities implemented jointly.", 
    "Delegates agreed to consider the item under the discussion on methodological issues. On the election of officers, Soobaraj Sok Appadu (Mauritius) was elected Vice-Chair and Alvaro Jose Rodriguez G\u00f3mez (Colombia) as Rapporteur.", 
    "On the organization of work, the Chair proposed establishing informal groups to consider the division of labor between SBSTA and SBI.", 
    "He also proposed establishing a group on methodological issues, to be chaired by Harald Dovland (Norway) and SBSTA Vice-Chair Appadu.", 
    "Thirty-four delegations expressed interest in participating. Division of Labor: On 28 July, delegates considered the document on division of labor (FCCC/SB/1997/2).", 
    "The document proposes, inter alia, that only one subsidiary body would address any particular issue and, if necessary, the other body would consider certain aspects of the issue.", 
    "LUXEMBOURG, on behalf of the EU, along with JAPAN, supported the proposed approach and, with SWITERLAND, emphasized the need for education and public awareness.", 
    "JAPAN noted that the division of labor for national communications and AIJ needs clarification.", 
    "The US noted that SBSTA should only refine unclear areas rather than redefine decisions. Some delegations, including MALAYSIA, SAUDI ARABIA and IRAN emphasized the importance of technology transfer to developing countries and the need for more detailed discussions.", 
    "Some disagreed with the document\u0092s proposal that SBI only address technology transfer 'at some point in the future.", 
    "' CANADA noted that some elements are appropriate to SBSTA\u0092s expertise, while others fall outside that, such as intellectual property rights, financial mechanisms and the role of the private sector. Delegates convened a joint informal group to produce draft conclusions, which was chaired by Amb.", 
    "Mark Hambley (US) and Jos\u00e9 Romero (Switzerland).", 
    "The group held consultations throughout the week and presented its conclusions on 6 August.", 
    "The same conclusions had been presented and adopted by SBI (see above). Methodological Issues: On 28 July, the Chair opened discussion on methodological issues and financing by noting that an informal group, chaired by Harald Dovland (Norway), would also be considering the issue.", 
    "He urged delegates to limit their discussion to general comments on the documents (FCCC/SB/1997/INF.2, FCCC/SBI/1997/10 and FCCC/SB/1997/INF.1) and leave detailed discourse for the informal discussions.",

    "On 30 July, the methodological group reported to Plenary that the group had found little overlap between the work of the Secretariat and other international organizations.", 
    "SAUDI ARABIA objected to the paper to be presented by the methodological group and stated that the Secretariat should not be given additional responsibility.", 
    "He called for a new working group to discuss Intergovernmental Technical Advisory Panels (ITAPs) and reminded the Chair of the G-77/CHINA\u0092s proposal on ITAPs. On 31 July, the Chair of the contact group on methodologies presented its conclusions in Plenary.",

    "ZIMBABWE noted that there was limited participation from non-Annex I countries.", 
    "The methodologies contact group reconvened for further consultations. On 5 August, the revised draft conclusions of methodologies group were presented in the revised report of SBSTA-6.", 
    "Regarding the work programme to be conducted by the Secretariat, SBSTA decided: to give highest priority to activities relating to methods for GHG inventories; high priority to projections of GHG emissions and sinks; and priority to methods for evaluating and monitoring the effectiveness of specific policies and measures for assessing adaptation strategies and technologies. The revised conclusions, inter alia: request the Secretariat to prepare a progress report on the work programme on methodologies; note that SBSTA-7 will begin consideration of appropriate ways to provide terms of reference for expert contributions and the review of technical documents; and provide an opportunity for submitting initial comments on priority areas and options for work on projections by 20 January 1998.", 
    "The conclusions also contain an indicative budget for the methodological work programme. On 28 July, delegates considered methodological issues related to crediting under joint implementation.", 
    "The US and the EU supported immediate discussion of this matter and said that joint implementation would be limited without resolving the issue of credits.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION noted that it was premature to talk about crediting.", 
    "They emphasized that joint implementation is still in its pilot phase with few projects and few countries involved.", 
    "NORWAY emphasized that the issue of crediting is complex and addressing methodology alone may not be beneficial.", 
    "He called for a broad examination of the issue before the specifics of methodology are considered. The Chair suggested postponing discussion of crediting until early next year in order to await the political deliberations that will take place at AGBM.", 
    "CANADA noted that each COP is responsible for the review of pilot projects and was concerned that the issue of crediting was being ignored. The Chair called on the US, NORWAY, CANADA and CHINA to draft a compromise text for consideration in Plenary.", 
    "On 30 July, the US reported that this small informal group had not produced agreed text and would continue consultations until the final SBSTA meeting.",

The IPCC stated that the Third Assessment Report (TAR) is scheduled for completion by the end of 2000.", 
    "In addition to physical, chemical and ecological processes, the TAR will integrate natural and social sciences and address sectoral issues and regional perspectives.", 
    "The IPCC will also produce a 'policy relevant' synthesis report. LUXEMBOURG, on behalf of the EU, highlighted its submission containing questions from policy makers, which focuses, inter alia, on progress in detecting change, non- intervention scenarios and possible policy combinations.", 
    "SWITZERLAND noted the importance of disseminating the TAR results in all UN languages and ensuring adequate resources for the IPCC secretariat. CHINA said the TAR should reflect the implementation of Articles 4.2(a) and (b), and with the US, called for briefings on the consultations of the Joint Working Group of the FCCC and IPCC officers.",
