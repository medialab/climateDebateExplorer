    "In its decision ( FCCC/KP/CMP/2009/L.10 ), the COP/MOP requests the Board to: significantly improve transparency, consistency and impartiality in its work; take fully into account, in its work and that of its support structure, host country laws, regulations, policies, standards and guidelines; consolidate, clarify and revise, as appropriate, its guidance on the treatment of national policies; recommend terms of reference for membership of the Board that clarify the desired set of skills and expertise, as well as the expected time commitment required of members and alternates, for consideration at COP/MOP 6; establish, following consultations with stakeholders, procedures for considering appeals in relation to situations where a Designated Operational Entity may not have performed its duties in accordance with COP/MOP and/or Executive Board rules or requirements, or rulings taken by or under the authority of the Executive Board; develop top-down methodologies that are particularly suited for application in countries with fewer than ten CDM projects, and introduce a requirement that Designated Operational Entities indicate in their annual activity reports, the work they are undertaking on projects originated in these countries; and allocate financial resources from the interest accrued on the principal of the CDM Trust Fund, as well as any voluntary donor contributions, in order to provide loans to cover the costs of development of project design documents and of validation and first verification for these project activities, in countries with fewer than ten registered CDM projects.", 
    "The COP/MOP also: requests the SBSTA to recommend modalities and procedures for the development of standardized baselines that are broadly applicable, provide for a high level of environmental integrity, and take account of specific national circumstances, and to forward a draft decision to COP/MOP 6; invites parties, intergovernmental organizations and admitted observer organizations to submit their views on the matter of standardized baselines to the Secretariat, by 22 March 2010; requests the SBSTA to assess the implications of the recommendation regarding forests in exhaustion as contained in Annex I to the annual report of the CDM EB; recognizes the importance of CCS in geological formations as a possible mitigation technology, bearing in mind concerns related to outstanding issues, requests the SBSTA to continue to work on the possible inclusion of CCS in geological formations in the CDM with a view to COP/MOP 6 adopting a decision on this matter, and invites parties to submit their views on these issues to the Secretariat by 22 March 2010; requests that the curricula vitae of Board members, statements on conflicts of interest and details of any past and current professional affiliations of members be published on the UNFCCC CDM website; decides to defer payment of the registration fee until after the first issuance for countries with fewer than ten registered CDM project activities; and requests the Secretariat to implement the staffing requirements in the CDM management plan in an expeditious manner."
