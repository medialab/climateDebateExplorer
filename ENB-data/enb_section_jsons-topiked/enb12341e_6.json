    "The fourth session of the AWG and the fourth Convention Dialogue workshop took place from 27-31 August 2007, in Vienna, Austria.", 
    "AWG-4 focused on the analysis of mitigation potentials and the identification of possible ranges of emission reductions for Annex I parties.", 
    "Delegates adopted conclusions referring, among other things, to some of the key findings of IPCC WGIII, including that global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak in the next 10-15 years and be reduced well below half of 2000 levels by the middle of the 21st century in order to stabilize their concentrations in the atmosphere at the lowest levels assessed by the IPCC to date in its scenarios.", 
    "The AWG conclusions also recognize that to achieve the lowest stabilization level, Annex I parties as a group would be required to reduce emissions by a range of 25-40% below 1990 levels by 2020.", 
    "At the Convention Dialogue workshop, participants initiated discussion on next steps after the results of the Dialogue are reported to COP 13."
