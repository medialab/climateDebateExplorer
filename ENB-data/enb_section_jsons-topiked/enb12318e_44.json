    "This issue was taken up in SBI plenary on 8 November (FCCC/SBI/2006/MISC.7 and Add.1, FCCC/SBI/2006/MISC.11 and MISC.16), and in a contact group co-chaired by Philip Gwage (Uganda) and Adrian Macey (New Zealand), which broke into informal consultations and small drafting groups.", 
    "The SBI adopted conclusions and a draft COP/MOP decision on 14 November.", 
    "The COP adopted the decision on 17 November.", 
    "In plenary, several parties urged early operationalization of the Fund.", 
    "Norway, Switzerland and Japan noted that the GEF is best placed to manage the Fund, while the LDCs favored its management by an executive body, such as the CDM Executive Board, with equitable regional representation.", 
    "Early on in the contact group, however, delegates agreed to the G-77/China's suggestion to address the Fund's overarching principles, modalities and governance before considering institutional arrangements.", 
    "The G-77/China further proposed a set of principles, notably on the COP/MOP's authority and guidance, and of funding covering the full costs of adaptation.", 
    "Canada highlighted a country-driven approach, efficiency and effectiveness, and knowledge and networking capacity.", 
    "The EU underscored synergies in the Fund's management, procedures and accountability.", 
    "South Africa said the Fund should ensure decentralized access, mobilize additional resources, and reduce barriers.", 
    "Closed informal consultations resulted in a draft COP/MOP decision prepared by the Co-Chairs, which contained bracketed text on issues including funding on full adaptation cost basis, a country-driven approach, the Fund's membership, and a request to the SBI to develop recommendations for the COP/MOP on the Fund's eligibility criteria, priority areas, monetizing the share of proceeds, and institutional arrangements.", 
    "Delegates succeeded in resolving these outstanding issues in a small drafting group.", 
    "During the SBI closing plenary, Co-Chair Macey emphasized that the Fund's principles and modalities were developed without prejudging the final institutional arrangements.", 
    "Parties welcomed the adoption of the draft COP/MOP decision, with the G-77/China describing the Fund as an innovative solidarity fund, and the EU noting it built new trust among parties.", 
    "Following the adoption of the decision by the COP/MOP, President Kibwana noted it as one of the achievements of the conference, and hoped the Fund would become fully operational at COP/MOP 3. COP/MOP Decision : The COP/MOP decision ( FCCC/SBI/2006/L.29/Add.1 ) contains the principles and modalities of the Fund, including: the Fund operating under the authority and guidance of, and being accountable to, the COP/MOP, which decides on its overall policies; funding on a full adaptation cost basis; accountability in management, operation and use of the funds; facilitative procedures for accessing funds; country-driven projects; and competency in adaptation and financial management.", 
    "The COP/MOP further decides that the membership of the Fund's governing body shall be from Protocol parties and follow a one-country-one-vote rule with the majority of non-Annex I parties.", 
    "It further requests the SBI to develop recommendations on the Fund's eligibility criteria, priority areas, monetizing the share of proceeds, and institutional arrangements for consideration at COP/MOP 3, and holding consultations on these issues before SB 27.", 
    "It also extends an invitation to interested institutions to submit their views on how they would operationalize the decision."
