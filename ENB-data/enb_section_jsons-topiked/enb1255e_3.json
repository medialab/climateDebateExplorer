    "The SBI was established by the COP to assist in the review and assessment of the implementation of the Convention and in the preparation and implementation of the COP\u0092s decisions.", 
    "SBI-1 took place from 31 August - 1 September 1995 in Geneva.", 
    "The SBI addressed a number of issues and recommended that the COP adopt the draft Memorandum of Understanding with the GEF as the financial mechanism, proposing a draft decision on this item to be adopted by COP-2. At SBI-2, held in Geneva from 27 February - 4 March 1996, delegates considered in-depth reviews of national communications, and matters related to the financial mechanism.", 
    "While delegates welcomed the GEF Council\u0092s adoption of its operational strategy, many noted the need to expedite the process of providing 'full agreed costs' for non-Annex I communications or risk serious delay.", 
    "At SBI-3, held from 9-16 July 1996 in Geneva, differences were resolved in closed sessions, and were considered for adoption by the open SBI session only after consensus had been reached on: technology transfer; the operating budget of the Secretariat; the Annex to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the GEF Council and the COP; and national communications from non-Annex I Parties."
