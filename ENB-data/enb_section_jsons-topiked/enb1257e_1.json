    "SBI Vice-Chair Jos\u00e9 Romero (Switzerland), on behalf of SBI Chair Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania), reminded dele- gates of the short time allocated for SBI negotiations at this session and urged them to conclude negotiations in a timely manner. FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit-Cutajar noted the need for support in developing initial national communications and strengthening national capacities.", 
    "He noted that projects for national communications can 'prime the pump' for future investments as much as pilot projects for lowering emissions.", 
    "Regarding the FCCC core budget, he noted that a number of contributions were still unpaid and additional contributions to the trust fund for participation were needed. Delegates accepted the Vice-Chair's proposal to establish a joint SBSTA/SBI drafting group on the financial mechanism, to be chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda).", 
    "A contact group on a consultation mechanism for NGOs may be established later. The Secretariat summarized a progress report (FCCC/SBI/ 1997/INF.3) including an update on preparation of initial non-Annex I national communications.", 
    "Nine Parties have reported no activities on communications, and no information is available from 15.", 
    "The conclusions included recommendations for, inter alia: accelerated submissions; reference by Parties to COP guidelines; appropriate institutional mechanisms; GEF procedural streamlining; provision for reproduction and dissemination of reports; a coordinated strategy for the transfer and development of technologies; and regional workshops. The Chair noted that Parties would also consider input from the GEF and the process for considering non-Annex I communications.", 
    "On the latter, he invited the US and MALAYSIA to chair a reconvened informal meeting to consider, inter alia, submissions by the EU and Uzbekistan (FCCC/SBI/1997/MISC.8).", 
    "The EU said that reviews of communications have built confidence and helped in developing second national communications.", 
    "BRAZIL reported the conclusions of a recent workshop to share Latin Amer- ican experiences in developing national communications.", 
    "Participants there highlighted, inter alia, problems with developing methodologies and the need for financial support. SENEGAL hosted an African regional workshop that brought together more than 100 participants.", 
    "The US commended the Secretariat's progress report, but cautioned that consideration of some of its recommendations should follow submissions by a broader sample of non-Annex I countries.", 
    "MEXICO announced plans for a regional workshop on preparation of national communications in Central America.", 
    "JAPAN said it was willing to cooperate with developing countries preparing national communications and noted its recent contributions.", 
    "ZIMBABWE called for assistance to the African region in making digital information available. MALAYSIA encouraged the Secretariat to continue its role in coordinating regional activity and suggested that the COP provide guidance to the GEF.", 
    "CANADA underlined the importance of capacity building, supported more expeditious financial provision by the GEF and noted the importance of an in-depth review of communications in the context of Article 4.1 commitments.", 
    "JAMAICA supported a GEF-sponsored regional workshop for CARICOM countries in November.", 
    "The DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO announced receipt of funds for the preparation of its national communication, to be submitted by October 1998. On activities implemented jointly (AIJ), the Vice Chair said Diego Malpede (Argentina) would chair a working group to prepare recommendations for both SBI and SBSTA.", 
    "The US said delegates could recognize that the pilot phase is still underway but agree that Parties can take credit from AIJ toward post-2000 commitments, congruent with decisions on methodological issues.", 
    "The issue is not whether, but how credit is taken.", 
    "He suggested adopting uniform reporting procedures and work programmes on methodological issues, financing and additionality of financing.", 
    "LUXEMBOURG, on behalf of the EU, said AIJ reporting needs further elaboration.", 
    "Project baselines, scenarios and emissions reductions should be more detailed.", 
    "CANADA noted progress in methodologies and benefits gained.", 
    "She said the lack of incentives for private sector engagement and of methodology for transparency and consistency slowed some areas.", 
    "She looked forward to a US draft decision, especially on credits and methodologies. BRAZIL said given parallel negotiations on QELROs and associated methodological issues, the review must be done, but he will not support any COP-3 decision that prejudges methodology work necessary to determine emissions reductions.", 
    "MALAYSIA said experience so far is not comprehensive enough to make an assessment of AIJ.", 
    "Only after reporting, baselines and methodologies are addressed can delegates consider credits.", 
    "CHINA said developing country participation, GHG abatement results and investment in AIJ have been limited, so it is premature for COP-3 to make a decision based on 'scanty' estimates and analysis.", 
    "Partners should come forward with secure funding.", 
    "SAUDI ARABIA said the issue of credits is at the heart of AIJ and should be ruled out for COP-3.", 
    "ZIMBABWE noted only one project among 53 African governments and said it is premature to talk about trading or credits. Regarding technology transfer, the Vice-Chair suggested establishing a contact group.", 
    "The US said it would submit a draft decision requesting that the Secretariat continue disseminating information and expand the technology needs survey, that SBSTA examine government and private sector activities, and that Parties encourage market policies promoting trade and investment in climate-friendly technologies and improved reporting on technical needs and arrangements."
