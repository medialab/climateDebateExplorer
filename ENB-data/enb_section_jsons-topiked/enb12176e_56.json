    "During the COP Plenary held Friday, 27 July, the COP considered draft conclusions proposed by Canada (FCCC/CP/2001/CRP.13) relating to its offer to hold an informal meeting on optimizing the uptake of cleaner or less greenhouse gas emitting energy, and inviting the Secretariat to convene a workshop on this issue prior to COP-8, and SBSTA-16 to develop recommendations for COP-8 to consider. Several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Algeria, expressed concern at the lack of time to consider the proposal, and suggested considering the Canadian proposal at COP-7.", 
    "However, many Parties, including Japan, Argentina, Senegal, Palau and Malaysia, supported the text.", 
    "Delegates agreed to a compromise whereby reference to a workshop organized by the Secretariat, and recommendations by SBSTA-16 to COP-8, were deleted."
