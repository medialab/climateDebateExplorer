    "The contact group considering HFC-23 under the CDM met to adopt draft conclusions agreed previously during informal consultations.", 
    "The conclusions note that COP/MOP recognized that issuing CERs for the destruction of HFC-23 at new HCFC-22 facilities could lead to increases in the production of HCFC-22 and/or HFC-23 and that the CDM should not lead to such increases.", 
    "The conclusions also call for parties, admitted observers and relevant intergovernmental organizations to submit their views on elaborating practical solutions by 30 July 2006, with a view to preparing draft recommendations with guidance to the CDM Executive Board for adoption by COP/MOP 2."
