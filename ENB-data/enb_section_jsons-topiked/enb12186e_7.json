    "There was both joy and disappointment at COP-7 Tuesday night as negotiators cut a deal on compliance but fell short of the mark on the mechanisms and Articles 5, 7 and 8.", 
    "Although there were handshakes and hugs as the compliance group finished its work, some observers were already speculating on possible trade-offs involved in securing the deal.", 
    "The mood in the mechanisms group was more muted.", 
    "Although the Co-Chairs' new text is free of brackets, it was apparent that a number of key issues had yet to be resolved.", 
    "On an optimistic note, however, some said that although the paper was not an agreed document, it was better to have a clean text that was not universally supported than one littered with brackets."
