    "INC Chair Raul Estrada-Oyuela opened INC-11 by noting a sense of satisfaction that 118 States and the EEC had ratified the Convention.", 
    "He said that one of the most important tasks of this session is the review of the first 15 national reports submitted by Annex I developed countries.", 
    "With regard to commitments, he stated that while some believe that after the year 2000 countries can increase their C02 emissions, this is not the case.", 
    "Annex I countries are legally bound to reduce their emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.", 
    "If this is not enough to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations, new commitments will be necessary.", 
    "Agreement on these new commitments will not be easy and may require greater involvement of large developing countries. INC Executive-Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar then introduced the provisional agenda (A/AC.23/77), which delegates adopted.", 
    "The Committee then adopted the schedule of work (A/AC.237/77, Annex II), as amended orally. In his opening statement, Bert Bolin, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), raised three issues: recent findings regarding radiative forcing of the atmosphere and the interpretation of the emission scenarios in the IPCC 1994 Special Report; the intensified general debate concerning knowledge about climate change; and the role of the IPCC in the future work of the Convention.", 
    "With regard to the latter, he said that it is most important that the future status of the IPCC relative to the COP be clarified so that countries can decide on ways and means to support the IPCC financially. Mohamed El-Ashry, CEO and Chair of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), noted that the Interim Secretariat of the Convention and the GEF have reached agreement on GEF arrangements to fund enabling activities and preparations for national communications.", 
    "At its first meeting in July, the GEF Council approved a two-track programme of work.", 
    "The first track will produce an overarching operational strategy, as well as specific strategies for the focal areas.", 
    "The second will allocate limited resources to a relatively small number of activities on which guidance is fairly clear.", 
    "He added that the GEF, in its replenished and restructured form, responds to the requirements of Articles 21(3) and 11 of the Convention, and is ready to serve as the permanent financial mechanism for the Convention."
