    "Even after the conclusion of the SBs, the corridors of the Maritim remained busy on Thursday.", 
    "Many commented that it was also a noisy day throughout the morning, a loud climate alarm blared from NGO activists outside the hotel.", 
    "Some delegates were amused and others welcomed the protest as a useful reminder of the seriousness of the issues being discussed.", 
    "However, some of those working closer to the source of the noise were not so understanding: I felt it was quite effective if the aim was to prevent us from concentrating on our work, one delegate half-joked.", 
    "Those following the AWG-LCA seemed already willing to reflect on the session s achievements and the possible way forward.", 
    "While some seemed puzzled by the brevity of the second week s AWG-LCA plenary sessions, others praised the immense amount of important work that went into putting together the text, which has now grown to over 200 pages.", 
    "What we did was useful and going through the text in an informal plenary setting, paragraph by paragraph, would not have been helpful, said one delegate.", 
    "He seemed optimistic that what might have seemed like a short-term loss of time could be made up for at Bonn 3.", 
    "Realistically, not much more could have been expected at this session, another delegate added.", 
    "Outside the plenary, one of the main topics discussed in the corridors was how the AWG-KP would move forward.", 
    "During the day, the form and content of the AWG-KP 8 conclusions were being worked out in a series of informal consultations with the AWG-KP Chair.", 
    "For some of those emerging from final informal consultations at around 8 pm, the mood was resigned: We couldn t agree on a mandate for the Chair to communicate text on possible Protocol amendments, so it looks like all we ll be asking him to do is to prepare documentation to facilitate discussions next time, one delegate reported.", 
    "It would have been nice to forward jointly a legal text, said another, but it s a negotiation, and I see why others didn t want to.", 
    "Some were surprised that the evening s informal AWG-KP meeting ended up being so short.", 
    "One senior delegate however was happy with the early finish, saying he had been worried about having to pull an all-nighter."
