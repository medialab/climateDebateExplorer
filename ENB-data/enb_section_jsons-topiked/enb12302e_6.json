    "During informal discussions, delegates discussed separate proposals from the Chair and the G-77/China for the paragraph on financing activities set out in Decision 7/CP.7, paragraph 2(d) (funding under the Convention).", 
    "These deliberations continued when the contact group resumed in the evening.", 
    "The group focused on the Chair's text, which proposed a two-stage approach, with the first stage consisting of technical assistance and a second stage on funding activities and programmes.", 
    "While there was general agreement that the two-stage process was a useful conceptual way forward, delegates could not finalize text.", 
    "Feeling that progress was being made and that it was consistent with the progress made at COP 11, delegates agreed to continue discussions informally and subsequently in a contact group on Tuesday evening, reverting to the SBI Chair's draft conclusions from SBI 23 (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.34) as the basis for discussions."
