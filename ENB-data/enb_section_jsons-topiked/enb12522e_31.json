    "It was just a little over a year ago, in October 2010 in Busan, Republic of Korea, when Sir Peter Williams, Vice-President of The Royal Society, UK, presented the major findings and recommendations of the InterAcademy Council (IAC) review of the IPCC processes and procedures.", 
    "The review was called for by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri to address major criticisms of the IPCC s work as a result of the discovery of a small number of serious factual errors in the Fourth Assessment Report, allegations of conflicts of interest among those involved in the assessment, and failure to respond adequately to these charges.", 
    "The IAC report contained recommendations on reforming IPCC s management and governance, communications strategy, and processes and procedures.", 
    "Since then, the IPCC has been busy addressing these recommendations, enacting changes that it hopes will make it more solid and able to weather the intense public scrutiny and attacks by climate change skeptics.", 
    "At the same time, the IPCC has had to focus on its work on the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the cornerstone of its activities.", 
    "With the IPCC midway through the AR5 cycle, these changes stand to have an impact on the AR5.", 
    "It is a useful moment in time to begin to assess how much the decisions taken so far have led to substantive changes in the IPCC.", 
    "This brief analysis will address these questions."
