    "Minister Carabias Lillo said the informal group on LULUCF had split into two sub-groups the night before, with one group focusing on the analysis of Article 3.4 (additional activities), and the other on the inclusion of LULUCF activities under the CDM.", 
    "On the work of the former, she said ideas had been discussed for discounting some elements, such as pre-1990 carbon uptake.", 
    "On the latter, she reported a common view within the group on the need to address permanence, and that discussions had focused on the possibility for further SBSTA consideration, with IPCC input, on this matter.", 
    "She said approaches for a first pilot phase of limited LULUCF projects had been considered.", 
    "She said the LULUCF group had now reached its limits, and there was little prospect of convergence."
