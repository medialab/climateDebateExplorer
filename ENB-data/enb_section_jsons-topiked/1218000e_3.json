    "The G-77 and China's revised draft decision on technology transfer was distributed.", 
    "The Republic of Korea, on behalf of the G-77 and China, noted that after consultations with other groups only three sets of brackets remained in the document. The first brackets were in the second preambular paragraph that lists relevant provisions of the Convention related to technology transfer.", 
    "The EU wanted to add a reference to Article 4.1.", 
    "The G-77 and China thought this was unacceptable.", 
    "The UK pointed out that Article 4.1(c) relates to the transfer of technology and Article 4.1 as a whole contains obligations of all Parties.", 
    "Australia supported the reference to Article 4.1 and noted that more discussion is needed on paragraph 1(b) concerning an inventory and assessment of environmentally sound and economically viable technologies and know-how conducive to mitigating and adapting to climate change. The Republic of Korea, on behalf of the G-77 and China, suggested as a compromise that Article 4.1 be included in the preamble, that the word 'terms' be retained in paragraph 1(b) rather than the 'conditions' under which such transfer could take place, and that the bracketed phrase 'and as appropriate' be deleted from paragraph 3(a).", 
    "France, on behalf of the EU, accepted this compromise, and added a footnote to paragraph 2(b) that a reference to communications include regional economic integration organizations included in the Convention. The US, supported by New Zealand, thought further discussion was necessary.", 
    "He asked if it was necessary to set the agendas for all future COPs in paragraph 3(a) and who will provide the advice to improve the operational modalities for the effective transfer of technology in paragraph 3(b).", 
    "After several additional proposals by China, the Netherlands, the US and the Republic of Korea, the Chair noted that the discussion must come to an end, closed the debate and suggested that the Committee adopt the text with the original compromise suggested by the Republic of Korea, on behalf of the G-77 and China, and accepted by the EU.", 
    "Despite protestations by the US that its concerns had not been addressed, the Chair gavelled this matter to a close and the text was adopted."
