    "Integral to the emerging and no doubt cross-fertilizing work programmes across the negotiating tracks are the so-called building blocks of mitigation, adaptation, technology and finance.", 
    "These key issues were considered both under the roadmap negotiations and in related talks on topics such as the Adaptation Fund.", 
    "With evidence that the confidence-building phase of negotiations has begun to yield some results in terms of the re-engagement of the US and engagement of major developing country economies, the Bali Conference was regarded by some, notably the EU and major NGOs, as the moment to lock the process into evidence-based negotiations on mitigation and commitments.", 
    "The timing and ambition of the EU's agenda was not unexpected and contributed to some of the fiercest exchanges between negotiators."
