    "On 21 October, delegates considered a progress report on methodological issues (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/9) and a technical paper entitled 'Methodological Issues: Temperature Adjustments' (FCCC/TP/1997/2).", 
    "The progress report elaborates on the issue of adjustments to national GHG inventories and projections, in particular those related to temperature fluctuations.", 
    "The Secretariat compiled information on adjustments submitted by Parties in the first and second national communications and analyzed the limitations of various methods and their implications. The EU said individual Parties should choose whether and how to apply adjustments, but should describe their approaches in detail.", 
    "Parties should report inventories without adjustments.", 
    "The US said careful construction of baselines and targets compensates for temperature and other fluctuations.", 
    "Multi-year averaging compensates for short- term fluctuations and requires no adjustments. MALAYSIA questioned the scientific basis for using GWPs and said they do not provide clear GHG inventories.", 
    "The Chair asked the Secretariat to prepare a text for consideration by the joint SBI/SBSTA contact group on this issue.", 
    "TANZANIA presented a draft decision that calls on SBSTA to identify gaps developing countries face in research and development of methodologies, monitoring and assessment capacity, and observational networks.", 
    "It calls on SBI to eliminate the gaps and provide financial and technical support. On 28 October, delegates agreed to draft conclusions under which SBSTA requested the Secretariat to prepare a report that identifies the gaps faced by developing countries in research and development on methodologies related to GHG inventories.", 
    "Following an amendment from the EU, SBSTA further concluded that weather adjustments, in particular temperature adjustments, to national GHG inventory and projections may be a useful tool for assessing the effectiveness of P&Ms.", 
    "Individual Parties might choose whether adjustments were applied, in addition to reporting unadjusted inventory data, and if so, which methods were chosen. Delegates also considered a draft decision for adoption by COP-3 (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/L.5) under which the COP reaffirms that Parties should use the Revised 1996 Guidelines for National GHG inventories of the IPCC.", 
    "The draft decision also contained bracketed text reaffirming that Global Warming Potentials used by Parties should be those provided by the IPCC.", 
    "The US proposed removing the brackets.", 
    "CHINA said the paragraph should be deleted.", 
    "The Chair noted that the AGBM Chair had requested advice from SBSTA and the substance of the answer is independent of any AGBM outcome.", 
    "MALAYSIA and the EU said a decision on this should await the outcome of the protocol negotiations.", 
    "Delegates agreed that no draft decision for COP-3 should be produced."
