    "On the issue of mechanisms' eligibility, Japan proposed text for an expedited procedure to review the reinstatement of eligibility to use mechanisms, stressing this as an issue of key importance to the country.", 
    "Several Parties expressed concern at the lack of time to consider the issue.", 
    "Decision text was agreed following minor amendments. On loss of mechanisms' eligibility due to reporting failures, Parties agreed on an EU package proposal including loss of eligibility triggered by: failure to submit an inventory; and exceeding specific Annex A source category thresholds.", 
    "Regarding reporting on LULUCF, ministers agreed on a compromise by requesting SBSTA to develop criteria for failure to submit information on activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4, similar to the criteria related to Annex A source categories, following work on good practice for LULUCF with a view to recommending a COP/MOP- 1 decision."
