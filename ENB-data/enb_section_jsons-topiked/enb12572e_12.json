    "The sunshine streaming into the Maritim seemed to inspire many delegates to continue working smoothly in SBSTA and the ADP.", 
    "However, the warm glow had worn off when the SBI s late afternoon plenary convened and it was formally confirmed that a resolution to the agenda dispute had yet to be found.", 
    "Chair Chruszczow, who one delegate characterized as evidently a very busy diplomat, explained that he was pleased to see that some key parties were now eager to talk, but lamented that divergent views had still not been bridged.", 
    "Some scheduled workshops, such as the Article 6 Dialogue and REDD+, will go ahead but others, such as on NAMAs, cannot be held as they would need to be formally included in the SBI agenda.", 
    "Some participants seemed resigned to the impasse, with one delegate highlighting that he was happy to see some steps being taken in the right direction, reflecting, however, on how long it would take to reach agreement when positions seemed just as entrenched as ever."
