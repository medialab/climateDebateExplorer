    "Much of the media's coverage on the collapse of the talks has focused on the apparent inability of the EU and US to reach a compromise on sinks and supplementarity.", 
    "However, to imagine that agreement on these issues alone would have saved the talks in the last hour is to make the arrogant - and mistaken - assumption that this would have proved acceptable to the G-77/China.", 
    "Not only does the Group have its own strong position on these issues, but there were also a number of unresolved differences on concerns of particular importance to the Group: funding and adverse effects, technology transfer and adaptation under the UNFCCC. Throughout the Hague there was strong divergence on the role of the GEF and other funding sources, as well as over the linkages with Protocol-related activities.", 
    "Pronk's proposal for additional sources of funding, including the establishment of an Adaptation Fund, a Convention Fund and a Climate Resources Committee, have received a cautious reaction.", 
    "The exact details of the operation of the proposed Funds and the amount of funding that will be available remain unclear.", 
    "Although these proposals could be viewed as being a positive step, the texts still link funding under the UNFCCC to actions under the Protocol, an issue on which the G-77/China strongly objects."
