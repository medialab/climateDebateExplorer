    "He noted a General Assembly (GA) resolution asking conferences to avoid collisions with GA meetings.", 
    "After discussion, the Secretariat noted governments will have to decide how to address this.", 
    "On COP-4\u0092s provisional agenda, the US said an item on voluntary commitments by non- Annex I Parties should be retained.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA, supported by BRAZIL, SAUDI ARABIA and BURKINA FASO, said there was no group support for an item on voluntary commitments and, with CHINA,called for transparency in drafting high-level statements.", 
    "JAPAN and CANADA supported the item on voluntary commitments for non-Annex I Parties.",

On implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 with Decision 3/CP.3 and Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14, ZIMBABWE, for the G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA, INDIA, VENEZUELA and ETHIOPIA, called on the SBI to identify the needs of developing countries, requesting information from SBSTA and the IPCC.",

    "Instead, FCCC Article 4.8, on response measures, implies that, if possible, Parties should implement commitments while avoiding or minimizing impacts on developing country Parties.", 
    "He noted the relevance of Protocol Article 2.3. Regarding a call for Annex I Parties to submit information on potential impacts of policies and measures (P&Ms), he suggested that those whose own interests are at stake are better situated to identify impacts.",

    "GEORGIA noted the readiness of many non-Annex I countries to take on voluntary commitments on GHGs, with adequate support under Article 4 within the framework of CDM.", 
    "A contact group Co-Chaired by Tibor Farag\u00f3 (Hungary) and Salamat Mohmad Salamat (Iran) will discuss the G-77/China\u0092s draft decision. The US called for constructive dialogue on the flexibility mechanisms and noted the similarities between the UK and Canadian papers on emissions trading.", 
    "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said differences in group positions on trading could be narrowed.", 
    "JAPAN suggested that the contact group reconvene in light of G-77/China\u0092s willingness to engage.",

    "An EU proposal for a draft COP-4 decision on revised guidelines was not supported.", 
    "A SWISS proposal not to limit submission of Parties\u0092 views to 'the scheduling of' subsequent communications was accepted. On a draft conclusion on involvement of NGOs (FCCC/SBI/1998/CRP.3), the US, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and VENEZUELA, the EU, and CHINA, deleted a request for additional information on the objectives of NGOs.", 
    "The EU supported existing arrangements accrediting three NGO constituencies.", 
    "SAUDI ARABIA, supported by CHINA and VENEZUELA, proposed that 'Parties' rather than 'Chairmen' agree on NGO participation in informal contact groups.",
