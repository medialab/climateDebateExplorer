    "A number of meetings and consultations were convened after COP-6 Part I in an effort to get negotiations back on track.", 
    "Shortly before COP-6 Part II, informal high-level consultations chaired by President Pronk were held in Scheveningen, the Netherlands, from 27-28 June 2001.", 
    "Over 350 delegates from as many as 130 Parties participated, including a number of ministers and deputy ministers.", 
    "The aim of the consultations was to permit Parties to present to President Pronk their views on his June consolidated negotiating text, which he had presented as a tool to help negotiators reach a compromise.While some participants expressed the opinion that positions did not appear to have shifted since COP-6 Part I, others underscored that positions had possibly widened.", 
    "They also noted signs of entrenchment by some Parties, in particular on the subjects of LULUCF, sinks in the CDM, and the use of nuclear facilities to meet commitments.", 
    "The funding issue also appeared to be a potential problem.", 
    "Further concerns were raised by some ambiguity on the part of Japan regarding its intentions for ratifying the Protocol. In addition to official preparations for COP-6 Part II, there were a number of political developments following the meeting in The Hague.", 
    "In March 2001, the US administration declared its opposition to the Protocol, stating that it believed it to be 'fatally flawed,' as it would damage its economy and exempted developing countries from fully participating.", 
    "Following the US announcement, the EU sent diplomatic missions to several Parties, including Japan, Australia, Canada, the Russian Federation and Iran, in an effort to maintain support for the Protocol and its entry into force by 2002.", 
    "The US indicated that it would participate at COP-6 Part II in negotiations on the Protocol in cases where talks might lead to outcomes affecting legitimate US interests, or if negotiations could set precedents for other international agreements.", 
    "It would be fully involved in all discussions relating to commitments under the UNFCCC."
