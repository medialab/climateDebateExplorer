    "On the structure of the three working groups, one delegate said their work should be better integrated, and that lessons could be learned from work on cross-cutting issues under the TAR.", 
    "Participants also raised the issue of addressing the interactions between the working groups.", 
    "Several participants expressed the desire to maintain the number of vice-chairs, and suggested concrete responsibilities for these roles, such as leading task forces for special reports, doing budgetary work or covering communication.", 
    "It was suggested that the economic aspects of Working Group II, and the technical aspects of Working Group III should be strengthened. General support for a fourth working group on greenhouse gas inventories was expressed, although with various concerns about the nature of the work of this group.", 
    "One participant called for transparent procedures and noted that making the Task Force a working group would add to transparency.", 
    "Participants' concerns regarding the proposed fourth working group related to the importance of avoiding the creation of a policy prescriptive group, as this working group would focus on demands set by the UNFCCC.", 
    "The need to ensure a transparent and policy neutral process within the working group was encouraged."
