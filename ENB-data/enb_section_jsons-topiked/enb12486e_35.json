    "In its decision, the IPCC: noted the IAC Review recommendation to strengthen and enforce its procedures on use of unpublished and non-peer-reviewed literature; decided to implement this recommendation and further key elements through its procedures and guidance notes; noted the revised General Guidance on the Use of Literature in IPCC Reports (IPCC-XXXII/INF.4 and Appendix I), which addresses aspects related to the IAC Review recommendations, and decided to adopt them as a Guidance Note; and urged the Co-Chairs of the WGs and TFI to take any necessary steps to ensure this Guidance Note is applied in the development of IPCC reports."
