    "Cecilia Conde highlighted the recommendations the group had agreed on, including the need for: vulnerability and adaptive capacity assessments; demand and stakeholder driven development of methods and tools; more communication between users and developers; more demand-driven approaches that can increase ownership; research on the history of adaptation (and maladaptation) and vulnerability; and clarifying the concept of vulnerability and operationalizing and quantifying vulnerability, if possible.", 
    "She also highlighted the need for more guidance on the proper use of methods and tools, including: limitations, potential users, examples of case studies, lessons learned and failures; a tiered approach, from simple to sophisticated approaches; a standardized description to avoid misinterpretation; and guidance on thresholds.", 
    "Regarding approaches, she emphasized: the importance of integrating climate and non-climate stressors on vulnerability and adaptation assessments; the usefulness of an ecosystem approach in addressing direct and indirect impacts; and inter-sectoral integrated assessments, and sharing experiences on criteria and decision making in different sectors."
