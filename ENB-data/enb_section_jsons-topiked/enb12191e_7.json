    "Zou Ji, UNFCCC Consultant, and Yolando Velasco, Programme Officer, Technology, UNFCCC Secretariat, jointly presented a working paper on Exploring Tools and Methodologies in Assessing Technology Needs.", 
    "The working paper provides an overview of the concepts of technology needs assessments and methodologies used by different institutions, and discusses various methodological options for assessing technology needs in support of UNFCCC Article 4.5.", 
    "Yolando Velasco defined technology needs assessment as 'a set of country-driven activities that identify and determine the mitigation and adaptation technology priorities, involving different stakeholders in a consultative process to identify the barriers and measures to address these barriers through sectoral analyses.", 
    "' On the process of technology needs assessment, Zou Ji highlighted three models: the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI) model, the UNEP model, and the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) model.", 
    "While the models differ in their details, Zou Ji observed that in general they all stress the importance of stakeholder input and a well-defined implementation stage.", 
    "He suggested that, based on the analysis of the three models, a general process of technology needs assessment can be elaborated, which involves: establishing criteria for evaluation of each technology by integrating core social and economic goals; identifying different technology options; describing the characteristics of different technologies and evaluating them with the above criteria; ascertaining the opinions of different stakeholders on technology preferences and synthesizing these opinions; ranking/prioritizing technology needs; summarizing and reporting the results of assessment; and setting-up a link with follow-up activities, such as design, execution and action plan. Barriers to this process include, inter alia, difficulties in identifying the right stakeholders and experts, a low level of awareness about the climate change problem, and the challenge of keeping the list of candidate technologies updated."
