    "The SBSTA heard a report on views expressed at the NGO workshop held over the weekend.", 
    "The workshop originated from a New Zealand proposal to establish a business consultative mechanism whereby different sectors could discuss commitments to emissions reductions.", 
    "The NGOs representing business interests said a business consultative mechanism should provide business with a convenient, direct and effective, additional channel of communication, further enable business to provide information in timely manner, and be open to all business NGOs accredited by the FCCC process.", 
    "Representatives from the local authorities wanted intergovernmental organization observer status and stressed the importance of local Agenda 21s.", 
    "The environmental NGOs said there was no need for a new mechanism for input, only better use of existing mechanisms such as access to the floor, written proposals and interventions in discussions.", 
    "They said delegations should include NGO representatives and that NGOs could also be involved in technical advisory bodies."
