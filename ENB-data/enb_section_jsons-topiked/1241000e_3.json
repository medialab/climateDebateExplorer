    "Several AGBM participants commented on developments towards a common position regarding QELROs within one regional economic integration organization.", 
    "Despite its internal debate on burden sharing, agreement was reached on a common target.", 
    "Some delegates suggested that this common position could advance the entire AGBM process by sparking a transatlantic debate.", 
    "In contrast, others characterized the proposed target as 'unrealistic' and doubted it would be taken seriously.", 
    "One developing country delegate said the proposal could sharpen AGBM\u0092s focus on strengthening developed country commitments, while others noted that the target\u0092s timeframe greatly lessens its impact."
