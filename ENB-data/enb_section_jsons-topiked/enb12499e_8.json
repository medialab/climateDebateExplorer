    "She called for: increased transparency; common rules for LULUCF accounting; a technical paper to clarify quantification of emissions, conditions, the scale of use of the Kyoto Protocol flexibility mechanisms; and a work programme for improving Annex I party ambitions.", 
    "New Zealand described the challenges that it faces in emission reductions as an agricultural export economy and said its target of 10-20% below 1990 levels by 2020 is conditional on: a trajectory limiting the global temperature increase to 2\u00baC; a comparable effort from developed countries and action by developing countries in line with their respective capabilities; effective rules for LULUCF; and a fully functioning carbon market.", 
    "Germany described its current emissions as 26.5% below 1990 levels, with a future target of 40% emission reductions below 1990 levels by 2020.", 
    "She called for: a legally binding framework to provide market certainty; funding schemes; feed-in tariffs; and monitoring of implementation.", 
    "During discussions, the US queried the AOSIS figures set out in an analysis of aggregate Annex I parties emission reductions for 2020.",

    "AOSIS noted that projections on sea-level rise reflected a precautionary approach and stressed the need to increase levels of ambition.", 
    "The EU agreed with much of the AOSIS data and welcomed the opportunity to get underneath the numbers."
