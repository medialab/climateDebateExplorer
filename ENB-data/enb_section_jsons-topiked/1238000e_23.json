    "During the SBI regular session, several developing country delegations called for language in the draft decision to urge developed countries to accelerate the pace of technology transfer.", 
    "This matter was resolved in a contact group. The decision adopted by the Plenary (FCCC/CP/1996/L.16) expresses concern over the slow pace of technology transfer, and requests the Secretariat to: enhance progress reports on transfer of environmentally sound technologies (ESTs) based on information in national communications; give high priority to development of a survey of initial technology needs of non-Annex I Parties, to be presented at SBSTA-4; initiate action, taking account of the Climate Technology Initiative of the OECD to develop databases on ESTs; and prepare reports on adaptation technology and on know-how conducive to mitigating and adapting to climate change and to prepare a roster of experts. The decision also urges Parties to: include information on technology transfer in their national communications and improve the enabling environment for technology transfer."
