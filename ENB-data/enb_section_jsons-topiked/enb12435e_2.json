    "At the morning meeting of the contact group, AWG-LCA Chair Zammit Cutajar invited parties to comment on a long-term global goal for emission reductions.", 
    "Antigua and Barbuda, for AOSIS, said that minimizing impacts of climate change on SIDS and LDCs should be the benchmark, and proposed global emission reductions of 85% by 2050 from 1990 levels with peaking by 2020, complemented by reductions by Annex I countries of more than 95% by 2050 from 1990 levels.", 
    "Mexico, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, JAPAN, the EU and the US supported the global goal of halving emissions by 2050, and the EU suggested that developed countries must decrease their emissions by 80-95% by 2050.", 
    "NORWAY supported a science-driven approach, and called for emissions to peak in 2015 at the latest and global reductions of 85% by 2050.", 
    "AUSTRALIA supported a global goal of halving emissions by 2050 and a peak in emissions no later than 2020.", 
    "JAPAN supported peaking emissions between 2015 and 2025.", 
    "SOUTH AFRICA suggested that Annex I countries reduce emissions by at least 40% by 2020 from 1990 levels and by 80% by 2050.", 
    "COSTA RICA, also speaking for Guatemala and Panama, said a long-term goal needs to be reflected as a numerical target based on science, and supported stabilizing concentrations at 350 ppm.", 
    "The US stressed that a long-term goal should inspire and guide collective effort and communicate this to the outside world.", 
    "He proposed moving discussions on mid-term mitigation targets, NAMAs and finance to the relevant contact groups.",
