    "The final text states that the current IPCC Guidelines do not provide specific methods for estimating emissions associated with CCS, and that such methods are expected to be provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.", 
    "It states that specific methods may be needed for net capture and storage, negative emissions associated with biomass, physical leakage, and fugitive emissions.", 
    "The text also makes reference to the limited experience of leakage monitoring and reporting, and the need to account for future and cross-border storage."
