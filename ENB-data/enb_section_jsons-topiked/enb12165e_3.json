    "The Third Assessment Report (TAR) addresses policy-relevant scientific, technical, and socio- economic dimensions of climate change.", 
    "It concentrates on findings since 1995, and pays attention to both regional and global scales, and includes non-English literature to the extent possible.", 
    "The preparation of the TAR was guided by a decision paper that had been adopted by the Panel at its thirteenth Plenary Session.", 
    "The preparation of the TAR has also been guided by papers on cross- cutting issues, such as equity, uncertainties and costing methodologies, published as IPCC supporting material to ensure a coordinated approach to these issues within all working groups. The TAR is composed of a comprehensive assessment from the three IPCC working groups, and a Synthesis Report.", 
    "The Synthesis Report, yet to be completed, will be written in a non-technical style aimed at policy-makers.", 
    "It addresses a broad range of key policy- relevant questions identified by the IPCC in consultation with governments and the Parties of the UNFCCC. Each working group has also produced a summary for policy makers and a technical summary.", 
    "The comprehensive assessments, Synthesis Report and summaries for policy makers have been subject to extensive peer review from experts and governments."
