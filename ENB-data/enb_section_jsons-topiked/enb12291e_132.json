    "Even though the outcomes of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 exceeded expectations, the future of the climate regime is still highly uncertain.", 
    "The Russian Federation\u0092s last-gasp push to have a reference to voluntary commitments in the decision on Article 3.9 suggests that they have joined the group of countries that may not be willing to take on commitments unless large developing countries are part of a future deal.", 
    "Other major parties, including the United States, Australia, India, and China, have begun to focus on technology development and diffusion via the Asia-Pacific Partnership, and this focus on technology is also reflected in the decision to discuss future commitments under the Convention.", 
    "How this and other multilateral initiatives ultimately fit with the UNFCCC process is an issue that will need to be assessed in the future. The future may not be clear, but at this critical juncture the Kyoto Protocol is operational and multiple paths to move forward within the UN framework have been established.", 
    "Given the real risk of failure in Montreal, it is hard to dispute that COP 11/COP/MOP 1 was anything but a success."
