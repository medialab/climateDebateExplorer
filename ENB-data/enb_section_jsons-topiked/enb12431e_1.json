    "Adrian Macey (New Zealand) served as interim facilitator.", 
    "He explained how the negotiating text had been consolidated and presented Facilitator Becker s proposal to move forward by considering the text in four blocks on: comparability of efforts; mitigation commitments and actions; MRV; and compliance.", 
    "The EU, supported by AUSTRALIA, suggested considering the level of mitigation ambition by developed countries.", 
    "He said the discussions should benefit from discussions under the AWG-KP where a list of emission reduction contributions has been compiled, while noting that the list compiled under the Protocol is not complete.", 
    "TUVALU agreed that such discussions would be useful but stressed the need to retain the Protocol.", 
    "Facilitator Macey said the suggestion would be communicated to the AWG-LCA Chair.", 
    "Parties then considered text on comparability of efforts.", 
    "The EU, supported by the US, AUSTRALIA and others, indicated that it was not necessary to include a list of comparability criteria in the outcome.", 
    "The EU specified that the assessment criteria are useful for the negotiations but not needed in the final text.", 
    "The US and AUSTRALIA stressed comparability as something that is important for national decisions.", 
    "NEW ZEALAND said there was no need to spend a lot of time negotiating comparability criteria.", 
    "Brazil, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed the need for a solid and strong definition of comparability, highlighting the Protocol as the basis for comparability assessment and identifying the need to define comparability through international negotiations rather than nationally.", 
    "TUVALU stressed the need for a legal and prescriptive approach to comparability and highlighted the Protocol as the benchmark.", 
    "CHINA identified four pillars of comparability, namely: comprehensiveness; nature of commitments; proximity; and compliance.", 
    "The US said stringency and comparability were different issues and supported focusing on national compliance structures.", 
    "Referring to the Protocol targets, he highlighted that while the numbers are similar, there are important differences in actions taken to comply with the targets, cost of action and visions on how the target affects the country s future emissions.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA noted that the Protocol s targets were based on pledges, which was not the solution preferred by all countries, and stressed the need for adequate mid and long-term mitigation by developed countries, saying this goes far beyond countries putting forward national numbers.", 
    "He stressed that: mitigation under sub-paragraph 1(b)(i) must take the same form of quantitative targets as under the Protocol; rules on MRV for all developed countries should be the same as in Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8; and information on compliance is an important part of comparability. JAPAN noted that, in addition to numbers, policies and measures can also be used in discussing comparability.", 
    "The US stressed that agreement on binding language on MRV would provide a way of evaluating obligations, and that a long-term perspective is important in measuring adequate stringency.", 
    "Facilitator Macey identified common views on issues such as importance of transparency, and differences on, inter alia: how comparability should be framed; emphasis on national or international assessment; and the need for text and explicit comparability criteria."
