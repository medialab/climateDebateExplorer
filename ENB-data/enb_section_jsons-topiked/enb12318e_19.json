    "Delegates were asked to consider the EGTT's 2006 report (FCCC/SBSTA/2006/INF.8), and the technical paper on innovative financing for technology transfer (FCCC/TP/2006/1).", 
    "The main issue under discussion was the review of the mandate of the EGTT, which expired at this session, and to decide on a new mandate and/or the continuity of the EGTT.", 
    "Significant disagreements started early on, with Ghana, for the G-77/China, tabling an elaborate text proposing, inter alia : establishing a new body under the Convention, the Technology Development and Transfer Board (TDTB), establishing a Multilateral Technology Acquisition Fund (MTAF) to buy intellectual property rights; and developing indicators to monitor implementation of the technology transfer framework.", 
    "Developed countries advocated instead continuing and strengthening the EGTT.", 
    "No agreement was reached on the proposed TDTB, MTAF, monitoring mechanisms or continuation of the EGTT.", 
    "During the last night of negotiations, SBSTA Chair Kumarsingh informed participants that if no decision was made at COP 12, there would be a gap in implementation of the technology transfer framework of at least 18 months, 12 months for a new decision at COP 13 and 6 months for implementation at SBSTA 28.", 
    "Faced with this prospect, parties agreed to extend the EGTT work programme and membership for one year, and continue discussions at SBSTA 26.",

COP Decision : In the decision ( FCCC/SBSTA/2006/L.27/Add.1 ), the COP decides to extend the EGTT for one year including its membership and to forward a bracketed text to SBSTA 26 for its consideration.", 
    "The bracketed text includes references to: the five themes listed in the framework; reconstitution of the EGTT; TDTB; establishment of MTAF; and development of indicators to monitor implementation of the technology transfer framework.",
