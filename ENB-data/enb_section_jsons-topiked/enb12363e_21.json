    "Given that the IPCC is currently riding the crest of a wave of success, there was little revolutionary fervor on display in Budapest.", 
    "Despite some isolated calls for more radical action, the Panel decided to maintain the current structure and process and adopt only a few evolutionary changes.", 
    "Many comments were heard about how different things are today from twenty years ago, when the IPCC was first created.", 
    "Not only is the reality of climate change well established, thanks in large measure to the work of the IPCC, but even the political will to address the problem has been strengthened, as demonstrated at the latest UNFCCC conference in Bali.", 
    "This means that the IPCC, which was created to address the needs of policy-makers, will be subject to higher expectations in the future as it is predicted that the demand for information will increase dramatically.", 
    "An early sign of this was the proposal by the IPCC Chair to create a task force specifically to address economic issues related to climate change.", 
    "While most countries found that such a task force was unwarranted because it could put too much emphasis on costing at the expense of broader environmental and socioeconomic concerns, participants agreed on the need to increase attention to practical action and options.", 
    "Many believe that the IPCC should adapt to this changing context and anticipate trends that will result from the renewed public concern about climate change.", 
    "After all, despite its successes, greenhouse gas emissions are still growing across the world."
