    "The Fifth Conference of the Parties (COP-5) met in Bonn, from 25 October - 5 November 1999.", 
    "With over 3000 participants in attendance and 165 Parties represented, delegates continued their work toward meeting the two-year deadline set out in the BAPA for strengthening FCCC implementation and preparing for the future entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "Ninety-three ministers and other heads of delegation addressed COP-5 during a high-level segment held from 2-3 November.", 
    "During its last two days, COP-5 adopted 32 draft decisions and conclusions on, inter alia, the review of the implementation of commitments and other FCCC provisions, and preparations for COP/MOP-1. On adverse effects, the COP adopted decision 12/CP.5 on FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14 (FCCC/CP/1999/6/Add.1).", 
    "The decision recognized that the identification of initial actions necessary to address the adverse effects of climate change and/or the impact of the implementation of response measures needs to be based on sufficient information and analysis within a clearly defined process.", 
    "The COP decided that the process of implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9, as established by decisions 3/CP.3 and 5/CP.4, should, inter alia, continue and gather information on initial actions needed to address the specific needs and concerns of developing countries and LDCs arising from climate change and/or the impact of the implementation of response measures, as well as identify what actions are necessary under the Convention relating to funding, insurance and transfer of technology to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing countries and LDCs.", 
    "It further decided that SB-12 would continue consideration of the implementation of FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9, including consideration of the extent of developing countries' efforts to diversify their national economies and of how the international community could best support such efforts.", 
    "The COP decided to organize two workshops under the guidance of the Chairs of the subsidiary bodies: one on the consideration of initial actions needed to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties, and the specific needs and special situations of LDCs, arising from the adverse effects of climate change; and another on the methodological approaches and actions necessary to address the impact of the implementation of response measures on, inter alia, terms of trade, international capital flows and development efforts.", 
    "The decision stated that the two workshops should be organized in two consecutive but equal time periods, before 31 March 2000."
