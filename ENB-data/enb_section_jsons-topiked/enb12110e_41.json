    "The over-arching issue of global participation (some speak of 'voluntary commitments') remained alive at the subsidiary bodies\u0092 meetings and is expected to be the subject of early debate at COP-5.", 
    "Some of the most interesting debates about global participation took place at two side events, one organized by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the Stockholm Environment Institute.", 
    "Argentina\u0092s delegation was represented at both and, together with other senior participants in the process, expressed interest in a proposal from WRI to overcome the stalemate created by the timing and nature of the debate on voluntary commitments for non-Annex I countries.", 
    "WRI believes that the stalemate has developed in part from an assumption that a developing country commitment would take the same basic form as an Annex I commitment, namely a limitation on the absolute level of GHG emissions expressed as a growth cap.", 
    "An alternative form of participation for developing countries would involve lowering the GHG intensity of their economies rather than measuring absolute emissions.", 
    "WRI has pointed out that among developing countries there is no discernible relationship between carbon intensity and level of development."
