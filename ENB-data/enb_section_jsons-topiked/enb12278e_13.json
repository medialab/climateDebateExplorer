    "This question was addressed in plenary on Friday.", 
    "The main issues under discussion were whether the potential for environmental risks from ocean storage should be noted in this section, and whether the early state of technological development on ocean storage is adequately reflected in the text.", 
    "Belgium, Denmark, France and Germany supported some reference to risks, while Japan, Kenya and Saudi Arabia suggested this was not necessary since risks are addressed in another section of the SPM.", 
    "Delegates also discussed: the process and time scale of equilibration between CO2 in the ocean and the atmosphere; whether and how to refer to Enhanced Oil Recovery in industrial uses of CO2; and references to the maturity of CCS system components.", 
    "Changes made to the draft SPM included: referring to contaminants rather than to hydrogen sulphide; emphasizing caprock as an essential mechanism for trapping CO2; and including a footnote to explain that CO2 contained in unminable coal, if subsequently mined, would be released."
