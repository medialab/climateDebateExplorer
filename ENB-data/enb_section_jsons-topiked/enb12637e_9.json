    "Despite clear blue skies in Bonn, the morning opened with muddy discussions on the mandates of various negotiating groups.", 
    "Delegates debated at length whether the mandate of the 2013-2015 review includes making substantial recommendations to the COP, whereas the ADP negotiations on pre-2020 ambition also became bogged down in divergence over the scope of the group\u2019s work. ADP negotiations on the new agreement trudged along on the streamlining and clustering of the text, and in the evening, some expressed moderate optimism on progress made.", 
    "Many others, nevertheless, lamented that, after nine days of hard work, it had hardly been possible to achieve clarification of options and negotiate on the text. With only one day to go, one seasoned observer wondered what the Bonn outcome would look like and, more importantly, how the success of this session should be measured.", 
    "While most agreed the yardstick \u201ccould not be page numbers,\u201d they also felt there was still a long way to go to turn the Geneva text into that of the Paris Agreement."
