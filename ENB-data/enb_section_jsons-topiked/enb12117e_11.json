    "The need for country-specific data related to LULUCF activities, including additional human-induced activities related to changes in GHG emissions and removals, continues to be a contentious issue.", 
    "Some participants feel that hesitation on the part of some Annex I Parties to provide country-specific data stems from a reluctance to reveal the implications of Article 3.4 activities (such as agriculture and land-use change) on the amount of their overall emissions and their ability to meet their Protocol targets.", 
    "Others are of the view that the more data available, the greater the prospects for informed decision-making about sinks.", 
    "The concern is that this controversy could have an impact on the timing of a conclusive decision on LULUCF, and therefore the entry into force of the Protocol."
