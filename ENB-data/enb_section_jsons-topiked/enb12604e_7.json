    "The agreement reached the previous night by the EU Council on a binding target to reduce GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels blew fresh air into the corridors of the conference center in Bonn.", 
    "While the announcement put a spring in the step of many European negotiators, others welcomed the clarity provided by the informal consultations on adaptation.", 
    "'The process is really allowing us to delve into parties' proposals', said one delegate, who added 'we can start to make real progress now we know exactly what is on the table'.", 
    "Others worried that the decision to postpone discussions on mitigation until the last day of the meeting meant this important issue would be left without enough time for consideration.", 
    "Frustration also bubbled on INDCs, with one delegate concerned that some parties' 'demanding impossible things' threatens to derail the process.", 
    "The ambivalent tone of the day deepened as some noted that, although informal consultations on finance had also been established, frank conversations about many issues had yet to commence."
