    "On additional guidance to the GEF on support to the IPCC, the EU said that whereas the Parties should send signals to the GEF that the IPCC project could benefit the process, it was not appropriate for the FCCC to prejudge the decision- making of the GEF Council.", 
    "He proposed that the FCCC request the GEF Council to consider rather than approve the IPCC project.", 
    "SBI adopted the amended draft conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2000/CRP.4), which note the importance to the IPCC project on 'Assessment of Impacts of, and Adaptation to, Climate Change in Multiple Regions and Sectors in Co-ordination with the IPCC'; look forward to the consideration of the project by the GEF Council; and request the IPCC in consultation with the GEF Secretariat to report on the further development of the project at SB-13 and 14."
