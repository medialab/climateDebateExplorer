    "The final COP/MOP decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2010/L.10) states that CCS in geological formations is eligible as a project activity under the CDM, provided that the issues identified in decision 2/CMP.5, paragraph 29 are addressed and resolved in a satisfactory manner.", 
    "The COP/MOP further requests SBSTA 35 to elaborate on modalities and procedures, and decides that these will address, inter alia , selection of storage sites, monitoring plans, modeling, measuring and accounting for leakage, risk and safety assessments, liability provisions, and restoration of ecosystems and compensation for communities.", 
    "It invites views on addressing these modalities, requests a technical workshop before SBSTA 35; and asks the Secretariat to produce draft modalities and procedures for SBSTA 35.", 
    "Standardized baselines under the CDM: SBSTA 33 first took up this issue (FCCC/SBSTA/2010/MISC.13 and Add.1, and FCCC/TP/2010/4) in plenary on 30 November.", 
    "The EU, Switzerland, Australia and others highlighted the benefits of using standardized baselines under the CDM.", 
    "Brazil underscored the importance of additionality and said standardized baselines would change the CDM s nature, while Papua New Guinea said they would be compatible with the current definition and make the CDM more efficient and objective.", 
    "Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Hugh Sealy (Grenada) subsequently conducted informal consultations with parties, which resulted in the adoption of conclusions during the closing SBSTA plenary on 4 December."
