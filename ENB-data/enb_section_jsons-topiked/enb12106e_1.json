    "On arrangements for COP-5, SBI Rapporteur Klaus Radunsky (Austria) reported on ongoing informal consultations on dates for COP-5 and on the timing and nature of the high-level segment.", 
    "He outlined two alternative proposals on arrangements for COP-5 and noted that, while both scheduled the beginning of the session for 25 October 1999, one entails a Committee of the Whole (COW) while the other excludes it.", 
    "He said options for the high-level segment are 1-2 November and 4-5 November.", 
    "On topics for the high-level segment, he said two options were being discussed.", 
    "The first proposes the high-level segment to address, inter alia: experiences; key issues; challenges with regard to innovative, efficient and state-of-the-art technologies; policies and measures; and the Protocol mechanisms, as well as ways and means of promoting their development.", 
    "The second proposes an exchange of views on the short- and long-term development of the Convention and the Protocol, including the implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA). The G-77/CHINA tabled a draft decision on arrangements for COP- 5.", 
    "He indicated that, inter alia: no 'contentious' or 'extraneous' issues should be included in COP-5\u0092s agenda; no COW need be formed; the high-level segment should take place from 3- 4 November; and Ministers and heads of delegation should participate on an equal footing.", 
    "He recommended that the high- level segment address the state of implementation of the BAPA and the early entry into force of the Protocol.", 
    "The EU called for dynamic interaction among heads of delegation during the high-level segment, rather than lengthy statements.", 
    "CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR and KUWAIT, inquired about the meaning of 'long-term implementation of the Convention' as a discussion topic and said the high-level segment should focus on reviewing the state of implementation of the BAPA.", 
    "The EU, with the US, noted the need for more consultations on arrangements for COP-5.", 
    "JAPAN accepted most of the G-77/CHINA\u0092s suggestions, except on timing for the high-level segment.", 
    "He emphasized COP- 5\u0092s role in building momentum towards COP-6. The NETHERLANDS announced its offer to host COP-6 in the Hague and said it was up to Parties to decide whether it should take place in 2000 or 2001.", 
    "He drew attention to significant financial implications for the host country if an early decision is not taken.", 
    "The US noted its preference to hold COP-6 in 2001 in view of the work required to solve pending issues, including the Protocol mechanisms, compliance procedures and LULUCF.", 
    "He proposed two sessions of the subsidiary bodies to take place between COP-5 and COP-6.", 
    "AUSTRALIA said that since COP-6 had important decisions to take it should be held early in 2001.", 
    "CANADA noted the importance of setting the technical foundation of decisions on issues such as technology transfer, the mechanisms and compliance.", 
    "He said there should be ample opportunities for subsidiary body discussions in 2000, which may affect the dates for COP-6.The G-77/CHINA preferred scheduling COP-6 in October or November 2000, and objected to additional intersessional meetings of the subsidiary bodies.", 
    "KUWAIT and LEBANON stressed that the COPs should be held on a yearly basis.", 
    "The EU expressed its flexibility on the timing of COP-6 but underscored the need for a prompt decision to permit the Netherlands sufficient time for preparations.", 
    "Chair Kante requested John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) to undertake informal consultations and report back to the SBI. The Executive Secretary said the Secretariat had scaled down its plans for the biennium 2000-2001, given the reaction to its budget, but added that no corresponding scaling down had occurred in the expectations of delegates.", 
    "He indicated that conclusions emerging from the contact groups envisaging activity in the budget period 2000-2001 should include a qualifier referencing the forthcoming decision on the programme budget."
