    "Emerging from what most likely was the AWG-KP s ultimate closing plenary, some confessed to feeling nostalgic.", 
    "However, for many, this sentiment was combined with deep frustration that there was no celebration at the end of the AWG-KP, just bracketed text and options to forward to the ministers.", 
    "Many also commented on the touching AWG-KP intervention by the delegate from the Philippines who emotionally implored delegates to open their eyes to the stark reality we face, informing delegates that typhoon Bopha has regained strength and is approaching another part of the Philippines.", 
    "Meanwhile, negotiations continued under the AWG-LCA, with finance as one of the key pieces of its complex puzzle.", 
    "The question was subject to informal ministerial consultations that lasted most of Thursday.", 
    "Despite the intense consultations, as one party put it, as of late evening, some parties were still unclear about what the outcome would be, but one fatigued delegate said he was still earnestly hoping for the best.", 
    "Efforts to advance under the AWG-LCA meant that the ADP closing plenary, originally scheduled for Thursday afternoon, was postponed until Friday.", 
    "The evening stocktaking plenary saw a climate skeptic hijack a party s microphone and request a review of climate science.", 
    "His statement was greeted by loud boos from the room and many delegates were outraged afterwards, expressing hope that he will be debadged and banned from the COP.", 
    "This strong reaction prompted one delegate to note that, even though we have a long way to go before we re able to say that we ve avoided dangerous climate change, based on everyone s reaction, we all seem to at least agree that climate change is a problem to be taken seriously."
