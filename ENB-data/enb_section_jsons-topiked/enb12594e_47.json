    "He opposed the annex in the conclusions for lack of proper discussion of its listed areas.", 
    "Stressing differentiation should remain valid and calling for referring to 'enhanced actions' when speaking of developing countries and 'commitments' when referring to developed countries, China, with the Philippines, called for a reference to Article 4 of the Convention (differentiation of commitments).", 
    "He stressed that the purpose of the ADP is not to create a new climate regime, but to enhance the full and effective implementation of the Convention, requiring means of implementation and transparency of actions and support.",

    "Nauru, for AOSIS, said the decision provides an opportunity to unlock mitigation potential to limit global warming below 1.5\u00e0\u008b \u009aC, and stressed parties should 'go home, do their homework, and bring options for decisive action' at key events next year.", 
    "The Gambia, for the LDCs, emphasized that it views the text in the 'spirit of compromise' and had not raised issues 'dear' to the Group despite concerns on: adequacy, science and NAPAs; lack of reflection of different capabilities; and insufficient reference to finance and implementation.", 
    "Expressing preparedness to accept the text, Colombia, for AILAC, called for acting within the framework of respective capacities and taking into account priorities of all parties.",

    "Prior to the ADP's adoption of the conclusions and draft decision on further advancing the Durban Platform (FCCC/ADP/2013/L.4 & Add.1), as orally amended, Bolivia and Cuba stated their understanding that the amended paragraph in the decision should be applied in strict conformity to Article 4 and, in particular Article 4.7, of the Convention.",

    "The ADP also requests the Secretariat to, inter alia : - organize in-session workshops; - enhance the visibility on the UNFCCC website of quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets, quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments and nationally appropriate mitigation actions, as well as of actions with high mitigation potential, including actions of public and private entities with adaptation and sustainable development co-benefits; - organize technical expert meetings in 2014 to share policies, practices and technologies and address the necessary finance, technology and capacity-building, with a special focus on actions with high mitigation potential with the participation of parties, civil society, the private sector and cities and other subnational authorities; - prepare regular updates on actions with high mitigation potential; and - convene a forum to share experiences and best practices of cities and subnational authorities in relation to adaptation and mitigation.", 
    "In its decision (FCCC/ADP/2013/L.4/Add.1), the COP: - warns that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies, future generations and the planet; - underlines the significant gap between the aggregate effect of parties' mitigation pledges and aggregate emission pathways consistent with having a likely chance of holding the increase in global average temperature below 2 \u00b0C or 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels; - affirms that fulfilling the ultimate objective of the Convention will require strengthening the multilateral, rules-based regime and the urgent and sustained implementation of existing commitments under the Convention; - urges all parties to the Kyoto Protocol to ratify and implement the Doha Amendment; - emphasizes that enhanced action and international cooperation on adaptation are urgently required to enable and support the implementation of adaptation actions aimed at reducing vulnerability and building resilience in developing countries; - requests the ADP to further elaborate elements for a draft negotiating text, taking into consideration its work, including, inter alia , on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building, and transparency of action and support; - invites all parties to initiate or intensify domestic preparations for their intended nationally determined contributions, without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions, in the context of adopting a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties towards achieving the objective of the Convention and to communicate them well in advance of COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those parties ready to do so), without prejudging the legal nature of the contributions; - requests the ADP to identify, by COP 20, the information that parties will provide when putting forward their contributions, without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions; - urges and requests developed country parties, the operating entities of the financial mechanism and any other organizations in a position to do so to provide support for the related activities as early as possible in 2014; - resolves to accelerate the full implementation of the BAP, in particular in relation to the provision of means of implementation, recognizing that such implementation will enhance ambition in the pre-2020 period; - resolves to enhance ambition in the pre-2020 period in order to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts under the Convention by all parties; and - decides to accelerate activities under the workplan on enhancing mitigation ambition."
