    "This contact group was co-chaired by Soobaraj Nayroo Sok Appadu (Mauritius) and Anders Turesson (Sweden) and addressed the submission of second and, where appropriate, third national communications.", 
    "Delegates discussed the draft decision forwarded from SBI-20, and two submissions, one by the G-77/China and the other by the US, that focus on the timing of financing and completion of second or third non-Annex I national communications.", 
    "Parties exchanged initial views on the submissions, stressing the importance of maintaining the capacity in national teams that was built during the preparation of initial national communications, assuring continuity in the project cycle, and accessing funds promptly. In response to the US\u0092 suggestion that non-Annex I Parties provide regular updates to their greenhouse gas inventories, the G-77/CHINA said that inventories are a 'non-issue' in the context of the contact group\u0092s work as no COP decisions require such updates and therefore the contact group should not address inventories.", 
    "A revised draft text will be compiled based on the submissions and the existing draft decision."
