    "Delegates leaving the AWG consultations late on Wednesday evening seemed in a buoyant mood, noting good progress on adding flesh to the bones of the list presented earlier in the contact group.", 
    "I'm cautiously optimistic that we might finalize our conclusions for this session by Thursday evening, said one.", 
    "A few participants were also commenting on the start of the Convention Dialogue.", 
    "I was hoping that the Dialogue would air issues that might not be discussed in the formal negotiations, but there were few new ideas or proposals emerging, commented one delegate.", 
    "Not everyone agreed, though, with some observers noting the more participatory nature of this discussion compared with previous ones. A few delegates also felt that some key messages, such as the potential of sectoral approaches, were being articulated more clearly here than in the past."
