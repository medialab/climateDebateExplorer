    "In the morning, ADP informal consultations took place, focusing on duplications in the revised text.", 
    "The work was based on the understanding that the proposals made in informal consultations will be considered in the contact group and included in the Geneva text only if all parties agree.", 
    "A group of parties agreed to hear proposals but said they were not ready to react to them.", 
    "A party suggested slowing down the pace of discussions, but reminded that breaking after each proposal to consult before reactions would not be possible in view of the negotiations throughout the year.", 
    "A group of parties indicated that one of their proposals could be deleted.", 
    "Another group of parties emphasized that a deletion requires that all parties agree.", 
    "One party explained that their delegation refrained from making structural suggestions even though they would streamline the text.", 
    "Some parties stressed that the discussions would not define the structure of the agreement."
