    "Discussions focused on a long-term global goal for emission reductions.", 
    "Many countries emphasized that a long-term goal should achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA stressed that a shared vision should be comprised of, and defined equally by, the four building blocks. AUSTRALIA noted the goal should reflect the collective ambitions of all parties, cover all emission sources and sinks, have a base year and a target year, and also include a mid-term goal.", 
    "SOUTH AFRICA said that the goal should be based on sound science, balance mitigation and adaptation, and introduce effective means of implementation and sustainable development.", 
    "MEXICO highlighted that a long-term goal should include a quantitative goal and emission pathways.", 
    "The REPUBLIC OF KOREA highlighted economic opportunities to shift to a low-carbon economy.", 
    "The BAHAMAS, with the GAMBIA, underlined urgency of emission reductions.", 
    "The LDCs said that, in addition to numbers, a long-term goal should aim to increase resilience of ecosystems and economies. BRAZIL and INDIA called for careful consideration of assumptions underlying scientific arguments.", 
    "BRAZIL noted that there are several pathways to avoid warming of more than 2\u00b0C.", 
    "PAKISTAN noted that an emission target is not the only way of expressing a long-term goal as it can also be described through MRV of support to developing countries which would lead to similar emission reductions.", 
    "SAUDI ARABIA noted that his country does not see a long-term goal, as a numerical goal.", 
    "BOLIVIA said other parts of a long-term goal should also be quantified, including, inter alia , changes in developed countries consumption patterns and compensation to developing countries for lost development opportunities. CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK stressed that mitigation is the best adaptation."
