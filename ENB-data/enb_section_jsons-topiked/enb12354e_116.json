    "The Bali roadmap builds on the negotiating tracks on long-term issues launched at the Montreal Climate Change Conference at the end of 2005.", 
    "In addition to the legal necessity to address the post-2012 period after the Protocol's first commitment period expires, the Bali roadmap aims to mend some of the fractures that have evolved in the architecture of the climate change regime, most notably the refusal of the United States to ratify the Protocol.", 
    "The institutionalization of tensions between developed and developing country parties, the crisis of confidence surrounding the implementation of existing commitments, and a growing need for the distribution of responsibilities to reflect the economic power and responsibilities of major emerging economies, have also haunted the process.", 
    "The Bali roadmap must continue to provide a means to re-engage the United States in negotiations on future commitments, with some level of comparability with other developed country undertakings; it must develop innovative mechanisms and incentives for the engagement of the major emerging economies; and it will be judged, above all, by the extent to which it addresses the ultimate objective of the Convention - to put the world on a path to avoid dangerous climate change - by responding, without equivocation, to the IPCC's findings.", 
    "At the heart of the Bali roadmap are the negotiating tracks to be pursued under the newly launched Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action and the existing Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Protocol.", 
    "The work of each track will be important, but - in all probability - it is the convergence of views, with each track taking the work of the other on board, that will inform deliberations on the ambition and the means for all to contribute to a future agreement or agreements.", 
    "One indication of the likely contents of the roadmap came early on in Bali in an intervention by COP President Witoelar during the Contact Group on Long-term Cooperative Action.", 
    "He explained that the roadmap has a track for negotiations under the Convention, with a milestone in 2008, and a destination in 2009.", 
    "The centerpiece of this track is the decision on the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action, which for the first time sets out a negotiating agenda that encompasses discussions on mitigation for both developing and developed countries.", 
    "Since the negotiations will take place under the Convention, they will include all parties - developing countries and the US.", 
    "However, there is some question as to the nature of the mandate for this track, other than a reference to the ultimate objective of the Convention.", 
    "Some have contrasted the work of this AWG with the stronger mandate built into the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Berlin Mandate, which resulted in the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "We may have to return to the COP to clarify and strengthen the mandate; for the moment we have taken a leap of faith, said one observer, hoping that the work would result in a binding agreement.", 
    "On the Protocol track is the work programme, methods and schedule of future sessions of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Protocol.", 
    "Important aspects of the work of the AWG will be taken on board and feed into the second review of the Protocol under Article 9 at COP/MOP 4.", 
    "One of the most significant developments in Bali was a shift that the Executive Secretary likened to the dismantling of the Berlin Wall.", 
    "While a two-track approach will continue and maintain a degree of separation between discussions under the Convention and the Protocol, the decision on the AWG on Long-Term Cooperative Action uses for the first time language on developed and developing countries, rather than Annex I and non-Annex I countries.", 
    "This is widely regarded as a breakthrough, as it offers the prospect of moving beyond the constraints of working within only Annex I and non-Annex I countries when defining future contributions to a future agreement.", 
    "It is anticipated that new approaches to differentiating contributions, tied to countries \u0092 economic capacity, will form part of the future architecture.", 
    "Moreover, the new AWG will also fully engage and address the future role of the US, which has not ratified the Protocol.", 
    "The risk in all of this, identified by some developing country parties, is that certain Annex I parties may seize on this development to jump ship and attempt to adopt more relaxed commitments than those under the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "This led to proposals for a firewall that would lock existing Annex I parties into the most ambitious end of the commitment spectrum."
