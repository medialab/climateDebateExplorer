    "A number of participants at SB 22 have commented on an apparent shift in China\u0092s engagement in the climate change process.", 
    "While some observers believe the Group of 77 is occupying familiar ground, they argue that China\u0092s role has increased in line with its emerging status as a major economic power-and that its positions on some issues may be shifting, too.", 
    "Some see the environmental fallout from China\u0092s rapid industrialization as a key driver of that country\u0092s approach.", 
    "The view is that China anticipates trouble ahead and has decided to help shape the architecture of the climate regime so as to minimize shocks further down the road.", 
    "According to some experts, another driver could be China\u0092s engagement with the WTO regime.", 
    "Observers have also noted closer collaboration between China and Japan, as the two countries eye-up opportunities for drawing down mutually beneficial environmental and economic rewards from the climate regime."
