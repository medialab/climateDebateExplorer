    "The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992.", 
    "The UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.", 
    "The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now has 192 parties.", 
    "In December 1997, delegates at the third Conference of the Parties (COP 3) in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission targets.", 
    "These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I parties, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.", 
    "The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005, and now has 183 parties.", 
    "The first Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 1) in Montreal, Canada in 2005 established the AWG-KP to consider further commitments by Annex I countries under the Protocol.", 
    "In addition, COP 11 agreed to consider long-term cooperation under the UNFCCC through a series of four workshops constituting a Dialogue that would continue until COP 13 . COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 took place in December 2007, in Bali, Indonesia.", 
    "The focus of the Bali conference was on long-term issues, and negotiators spent much of their time seeking agreement on a two-year process, or Bali roadmap, to conclude negotiations by COP 15 in December 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark.", 
    "This roadmap includes tracks under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "Negotiations on the follow-up to the Convention Dialogue resulted in agreement on a Bali Action Plan that established the AWG-LCA, which was mandated to launch a comprehensive process on long-term cooperative action under the Convention.", 
    "The Bali Action Plan identifies four key elements: mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology.", 
    "The Plan also contains a non-exhaustive list of issues to be considered under each of these areas and calls for articulating a shared vision for long-term cooperative action.", 
    "The first session of the AWG-LCA and fifth session of the AWG-KP took place from 31 March to 4 April 2008, in Bangkok, Thailand.", 
    "Further sessions were held in June 2008 in Bonn, Germany and in August 2008 in Accra, Ghana.",
