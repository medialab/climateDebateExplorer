    "Delegates arriving in the capacious interior of the UNESCAP building in Bangkok hit the ground running, as they attended a number of parallel discussions and events, in an effort to make the most of the last few remaining negotiating days before the Doha COP.", 
    "Feelings and expectations were mixed, with some developing country delegates indicating that ADP discussions could not really take flight until the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP are satisfactorily concluded, fearing promises from Bali will never be realized.", 
    "As one noted, New treaties are a promise, not a fact.", 
    "We can t expect others to jump off a plane without a parachute, with only promises of parachute delivery on the way down.", 
    "Others commented on the fact that various like-minded countries were coming together to voice their opinions on specific issues with increasing frequency, perhaps, as noted by one seasoned observer, indicating widening differentiation of positions among developing countries as discussions progress on implementation.",
