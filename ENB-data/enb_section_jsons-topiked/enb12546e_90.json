    "Bonn demonstrated that, as many have said, Durban was a carefully negotiated package contingent on all elements of the outcome moving forward in tandem.", 
    "However, what is clear is that parties have a very different perspective of what the future looks like in terms of, inter alia , the ADP s mandate, how to terminate the AWGs and what to focus on for effectively addressing climate change.", 
    "As evidenced in Bonn, constructive ambiguity results in uncertainty that can sometimes breed mistrust.", 
    "This mistrust is often manifested through disputes over procedure and consequently hampers progress.", 
    "Looking ahead, parties have their work cut out to accomplish tasks they agreed to in Durban.", 
    "They will need to exercise goodwill, integrity and congeniality in order to deliver on the ultimate objective of meaningful mitigation action for the post-2012 era."
