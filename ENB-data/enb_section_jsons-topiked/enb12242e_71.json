    "'A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,' is how Winston Churchill once described Russia.", 
    "He was speaking in 1939, but his comments could easily apply today, especially when it comes to deciphering the country\u0092s position on the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "Perhaps the relatively relaxed pace of negotiations at SB-20 can be attributed in part to the fact that delegates are still waiting on Russia\u0092s all-important decision that will determine Kyoto\u0092s fate.", 
    "Some observers seemed impressed that negotiators at SB-20 were able to engage in such complex and intricate negotiations, let alone seek innovations to improve the process, when the future of the Protocol remains in such doubt.", 
    "Although the issue of Russian ratification was not mentioned too often at SB-20 - perhaps because participants are tired of the news networks having cried wolf too often in the past - it must have been ever-present in the minds of the delegates.", 
    "Many secretly seem to be hoping that Russian ratification will be announced in Buenos Aires in December.", 
    "If this happens, the tenth Conference of the Parties (and tenth anniversary celebrations) will without doubt mark the end of the 'quiet' times experienced lately, and the beginning of an exciting new stage in the ongoing fight to save the world from climate change."
