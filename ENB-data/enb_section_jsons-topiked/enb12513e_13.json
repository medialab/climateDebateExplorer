    "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/ 2011/L.10), the SBSTA notes that in order to enhance the near-term prospect of the implementation of the projects identified through the technology needs assessment (TNA) process, projects should be presented as broadly as possible, through existing and enhanced means, to potential sources of financing.", 
    "It further notes that TNAs could provide useful information to parties for activities under the new Technology Mechanism.", 
    "Recalling its request at SBSTA 33 for the Secretariat to organize two training workshops on preparing technology transfer projects for financing for non-Annex I parties and to report on progress in the implementation of a pilot online training course on this matter, the SBSTA further invites parties and relevant organizations to provide financial support to ensure the timely and effective organization of these activities"
