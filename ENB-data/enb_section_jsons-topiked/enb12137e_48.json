    "Some delegates who participated in the debate on LULUCF expressed concern at the pressure to hasten the negotiations.", 
    "Although this was expected, since some Parties tied progress on sinks and a decision at COP-6 to ratification of the Protocol, many were uneasy about the implications of a rushed decision on the credibility of the Protocol. As a result, while many non-Annex I Parties were playing for time regarding consideration of the IPCC Special Report and workshops with a capacity building function, other Parties tabled concrete work plans for rapid progress towards decisions at COP-6.", 
    "By the end of the session, Parties had barely begun to identify positions regarding definitions/accounting scenarios and additional human induced activities.", 
    "These positions will become more apparent during the upcoming workshop in Poland as well as in the 1 August submissions, both of which will set the stage for Lyon and pose a key test for the environmental integrity of the Kyoto Protocol."
