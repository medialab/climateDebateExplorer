    "Interest was shown in the budget or multi-year approach with the proviso that budget schedules begin promptly and not extend over a long time period.", 
    "On proposals for a banking approach, some Parties suggested using limits on borrowing to penalize non-compliance.", 
    "Parties broached the issue of whether the base year measurement should be fixed or averaged.", 
    "Flexibility in this regard was considered for the economies in transition, as they would have most to lose from averaging out a base year figure. There was general support for a strong compliance regime with penalty provisions.", 
    "One Annex I Party reportedly called for the use of 'review teams' of experts as opposed to SBSTA.", 
    "A penalty system of imposing percentage increases in the required emissions reductions for non-compliance was also raised.", 
    "Others sought a shift away from penalties and towards realizable targets.", 
    "A proposal linking the annual rate of GHG emissions to the increase in global mean surface temperature was called into question when it was suggested that this new modeling process would slow progress. On Saturday, 2 August, the non-group discussed, inter alia, a compensation mechanism for the effects of response measures."
