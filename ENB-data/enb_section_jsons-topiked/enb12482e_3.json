    "In the drafting group, parties focused on how to move discussions forward.", 
    "They addressed the possibility of clustering issues relating to developed country mitigation and discussing these separately in two spinoff groups.", 
    "It was proposed that one cluster be on the inscription of developed country economy-wide targets or commitments, and include: the relationship to Kyoto Protocol targets and to the final agreed outcome under the AWG-LCA; mid and long-term targets; the concept of graduation and inclusion into Annex I; and inscription of developed country targets or commitments.", 
    "The other cluster would be on MRV for enhanced developed country mitigation action, and include: the focus of MRV; general MRV provisions including the basis and structure of MRV, and comparability of efforts; compliance with targets or commitments; and a work programme on MRV.", 
    "Many parties supported clustering and addressing issues in this manner.", 
    "Others objected, noting the cross-cutting nature of some of the issues and the difficulty of discussing them separately.", 
    "Several parties preferred to discuss all the issues in a single group to ensure coherence.", 
    "Some parties also objected to some of the issues listed for discussion.", 
    "Consultations will continue."
