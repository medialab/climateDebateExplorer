    "At lunchtime, a good number of delegates participated in informal consultations by the incoming presidency of COP 19.", 
    "Poland reassured attendees of a transparent, inclusive and party-driven process, as well as facilitation of a meaningful stakeholder engagement.", 
    "Expectations for the meeting, however, diverged; for instance, while a developing country delegate labeled COP 19 the Finance COP, emphasizing means of implementation through scaled-up finance and technology transfer; another said: COP 19 is the moment for establishing a loss and damage mechanism, and yet another emphasized that CBDR is key, and COP 19 should focus on enhanced action for the implementation of the Convention.", 
    "Developed countries also seemed to have their own views on what to expect from COP 19, with a group of delegates noting that, in Warsaw, making progress on market mechanisms and MRV and agreeing on a work process that builds a foundation for a legally binding agreement applicable to all parties will be key.", 
    "Meanwhile the evening informal SBI consultation convened on the agenda was not able to yield good news.", 
    "Many SBI delegates had spent the day helping out their busy SBSTA colleagues, with one resigned to continuing to learn more about SBSTA s work, if the stalemate persisted."
