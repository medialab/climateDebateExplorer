    "Although Ministers at the high-level segment agreed on the need to intensify efforts in preparing for COP-6, a proposal by Japan to establish a facilitator to assist the COP-5 President in undertaking consultations and maintaining the necessary political momentum was met with mixed feelings in the corridors.", 
    "While some considered that a full-time facilitator would be indispensable to accelerating the pace of negotiations in the run-up to COP-6, others felt this would be detrimental to the open, participatory process that many believe to be crucial to a successful outcome at COP-6.", 
    "A number of observers linked the proposal for a facilitator to the fact that COP-6 will take place earlier rather than later.", 
    "Some suggested that the key to success at COP-6 could lie in combining a fully-participatory approach, supported by capacity building, with the political impetus that a facilitator could provide."
