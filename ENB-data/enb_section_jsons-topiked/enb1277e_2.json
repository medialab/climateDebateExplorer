    "The period following COP-3 witnessed a flurry of meetings, statements and events as countries embarked on the task of developing initial plans for implementation, addressing domestic reactions and developing processes to further define the terms of the Kyoto Protocol. Implementation of the Protocol was addressed at a number of high-level meetings.", 
    "On 17 May, the final communiqu\u00e9 of the G8 meeting in Birmingham, UK, welcomed the recent signature of the Protocol by some G8 countries and confirmed the intention of the rest to sign it within the next year.", 
    "The leaders agreed to, inter alia: undertake domestic action to reduce emissions; develop flexible mechanisms; and draw up rules to ensure a verifiable trading system and an effective compliance regime.", 
    "OECD Environment Ministers agreed on 3 April that OECD members would give a high priority to ratifying and implementing the Protocol.", 
    "On 1 April, G8 Energy Ministers met in Moscow and signed a communiqu\u00e9 on cooperation in the energy sector that included a call to give special attention to the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "In a joint statement issued at the Summit of the Americas in Santiago, the presidents of the US and Chile, inter alia: stressed that the Protocol\u0092s market mechanisms would mobilize private sector resources; recognized the potential of the Clean Development Mechanism; and noted that developing countries should participate meaningfully in efforts to address climate change by, for example, taking on emissions targets. On 30 May, the US, France, Britain and others began discussions in Paris on holding one or more international conferences to persuade India and Pakistan to renounce further nuclear testing in return for help from the industrial world in developing civilian nuclear power centers.", 
    "French President Chirac also noted the threat of a 'pollution bomb' if these and other Asian countries do not switch to clean energy sources, 'a principal issue of the Kyoto conference on global warming last December.", 
    "' He said imposing sanctions on India and Pakistan would make it more difficult for them to switch. Regional conferences in Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America were organized to serve as fora for presentation of the methodological framework, results and experience of national studies, and their relevance and replicability in the region.", 
    "A conference on Climate Change Mitigation in Africa was held in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe from 18-20 May 1998.", 
    "Twenty-four African countries were represented at the conference as well as representatives from the UNEP Centre Denmark, Danida, GTZ, UNDP and UNEP.", 
    "The Conference was held as part of the final stage of the UNEP/GEF project 'Economics of Climate Change Limitation,' ran in parallel with the conference for Latin America held in Quito, Ecuador from 21 - 22 May. At other meetings, the Protocol\u0092s flexibility mechanisms, particularly emissions trading, drew considerable attention.", 
    "At the first GEF Assembly on 2 April, the World Bank's managing director of operations said the Bank plans to set up a pilot project to help countries trade their carbon dioxide emissions allowances.", 
    "The project, called the Carbon Investment Fund, would help buyers and sellers trade their allowed emissions.", 
    "He said the bank might be able to withdraw from the project eventually and let the private sector take it over and widen its scale. A meeting on emissions trading, sponsored by the Columbia Earth Institute, UNDP, UNESCO, UNIDO and UNEP Organizing Committee, was held from 24-26 April in New York.", 
    "Participants discussed several topics including the quantity and price of emissions permits, the necessity of private-sector participation, and the failure of past efforts to produce incentives for technology transfer.", 
    "Panel discussions elaborated on issues such as opposition to the Kyoto Protocol by both the private sector and developing countries due to fear of negative economic impacts and achieving mitigation through interaction between developing countries and the private sector. UNCTAD held an expert group meeting on emissions trading in London on 12 May.", 
    "Some participants noted that attitudes toward the concept of trading were apparently shifting and said trading provides both efficiency and flexibility in meeting established targets and timetables, as well as incentives for the development of new technologies.", 
    "Others, however, expressed concern about lack of interest in buying and selling something as diffuse and unclear as the right to emit carbon dioxide.", 
    "Environmental NGOs were concerned that trading will allow wealthy countries to buy permits to emit carbon dioxide that has not been emitted by Russia due to its economic crisis. Some countries and businesses have taken initial actions under the flexibility mechanisms.", 
    "On 5 March, Suncor Energy Inc. (Canada) and Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (US), announced a greenhouse gas emissions trade that the two companies hoped would be a first step towards the creation of a global market and an international trading system.", 
    "On 11 March, a climate project in Bolivia was finalized, which participants hoped would become an example of how forest protection projects can be used to offset emissions.", 
    "As part of the project, the Bolivian government has added 2.1 million acres of tropical forests to the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, essentially doubling its size.", 
    "By investing in the protection of this area, three U.S. corporations, American Electric Power, BP America and PacifiCorp, and the Bolivian government will receive carbon offset credits. Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, in their summit on 19 April in Kawana, agreed to begin feasibility studies on twenty promising joint implementation projects to improve energy efficiency at Russian plants and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and gain offsets against their own emissions.", 
    "The two leaders also agreed to expand cooperation in energy to the field of nuclear technology."
