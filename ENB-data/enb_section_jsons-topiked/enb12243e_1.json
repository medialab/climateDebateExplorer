    "Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on human health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural resources, and physical infrastructure.", 
    "Global climate varies naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of anthropogenically-emitted greenhouse gases in the Earth\u0092s atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate. Scientific observations on climate change were brought to policy-makers\u0092 attention in the late 1970s.", 
    "Scientific uncertainty was high, and debate on whether or how to take action took place throughout the 1980s.", 
    "By the end of the decade, the international community had agreed that a global framework for action was necessary to stabilize the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous anthropogenic interference' with the climate system.", 
    "Gases that were considered necessary to control included methane, nitrous oxide, and, in particular, carbon dioxide. Negotiations on the UNFCCC began in 1991, and governments adopted it in June 1992.", 
    "The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now has 189 Parties."
