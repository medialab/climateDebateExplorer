    "At SBSTA-19, meeting in conjunction with COP-9, in December 2003, in Milan, Italy, Parties examined data showing that, while the aggregate 2000 greenhouse gas emissions of Annex I Parties were below 1990 levels, these emissions are expected to increase in the period 2000-2010.", 
    "Data was compiled based on information in national communications and from in-depth reviews of the communications carried out by the Secretariat.", 
    "As a result of the data, Parties agreed to take further action to implement P&Ms to contribute to modifying longer-term trends in emissions.", 
    "The COP decided to request the Secretariat to prepare a summary report of the in-depth reviews of Annex I national communications, as well as to organize a workshop to facilitate timely submission of fourth national communications.", 
    "SBSTA-19 also agreed that a workshop on emissions projections was necessary in order to support the preparation of fourth national communications."
