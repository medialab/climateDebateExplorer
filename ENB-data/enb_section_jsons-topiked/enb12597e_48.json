    "Chair of the COI Committee Hoesung Lee (Republic of Korea) presented the Committee's report (IPCC-XXXIX/Doc.10).", 
    "He stated that, during the meeting held on the margins of WGIII, the Committee discussed the advisory note by the COI Expert Advisory Group (EAG) on: to what extent IPCC Bureau members could be considered to have a conflict of interest if they are also members of a government delegation to other climate bodies, such as the UNFCCC; and how to improve the conflict of interest form to receive more detailed information from Bureau and Task Force Bureau (TFB) members.", 
    "The EAG found, and the COI Committee agreed, that Bureau members had an inherent conflict of interest as a consequence of their nomination by governments and indicated it was preferable for them to disclose their association with other climate processes, such as the UNFCCC.", 
    "The EAG also proposed a more elaborated COI disclosure form to be presented to the Panel before the election of a new Bureau.", 
    "On the EAG's finding of the Bureau members' inherent conflict of interest, Brazil disagreed, noting that the IPCC is only complete with the endorsement of its scientific findings by governments.", 
    "He supported a closer relationship between lead authors and government officials, so that scientific knowledge 'could be produced in a more policy-relevant way', stating that the need for greater transparency was not limited to Bureau members.", 
    "Saudi Arabia and the Maldives expressed concern over the implications of the EAG's finding for developing countries' participation in the work of the Panel.", 
    "Observing that the COI Committee was established to look out for the IPCC's best interests, Canada supported its actions and highlighted the importance of understanding the different roles people play at different times.", 
    "The US stated the need to examine: the meaning of 'conflict of interest'; to whom it pertains; its implications; and ways of conveying scientific findings to government institutions.", 
    "Germany requested more information on the kind of decisions to be taken on the basis of the EAG's advice.", 
    "Brazil observed that determination of a conflict of interest for those participating in the UNFCCC was up to the Panel, and supported a plenary discussion on the issue.", 
    "Austria said there were limitations to how the COI policy could be changed.", 
    "Stating that it was inappropriate for the COI Committee to take decisions on intergovernmental issues on behalf of the Panel, Saudi Arabia called for clarity on the COI Committee's terms of reference. IPCC Chair Pachauri assured participants that their views would be recorded in the report of the session and communicated to the COI Committee."
