    "Concern over perceived shortcomings of the GEF in delivering on its role as an operating entity of the FCCC's financial mechanism once again reverberated in the Maritim corridors.", 
    "A number of participants criticized the rigid eligibility criteria by which the GEF interprets and weights proposals submitted by countries as unrealistic, and said these criteria can delay the process of implementing national actions.", 
    "While some felt that the problems arise from inadequate guidance given to the GEF by the COP, others attributed them to difficulties in co-ordinating the interests and mandates of two intergovernmental bodies.", 
    "In response to these concerns, a number of participants called for a country-led review of the GEF's role so as to facilitate implementation of the FCCC, particularly by the least developed countries."
