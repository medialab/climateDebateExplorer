    "The final text: describes and elaborates on cost increases in electricity generation associated with the use of CCS in electricity production; explains that retrofitting existing plants with CO2 capture is expected to lead to higher costs and lower efficiencies than for newly built power plants with capture; states that in most CCS systems, the cost of capture is the largest cost component; and notes that energy and economic models indicate that the major contribution of CCS systems to climate change mitigation would come from deployment in the electricity sector, with most modeling suggesting that CCS systems start to deploy at a significant level when CO2 prices begin to reach approximately US$25-30 per ton of CO2. The text further notes that: it is likely that, worldwide, there is a technical potential of at least about 2,000 Gt CO2 of storage capacity in geological formations; the economic potential of CCS averaged over a range of baseline scenarios would mean that CCS contributes 15 to 55% to the cumulative mitigation effort worldwide until 2100, although uncertainties in these economic potential estimates are significant; and the role of CCS in mitigation portfolios increases and is found to reduce stabilization costs over the course of the century in most scenarios.", 
    "The section title includes a footnote explaining that costs, as used in the SPM, refer only to market prices and do not include external costs such as environmental and societal costs that may be associated to the use of CCS."
