    "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.10), the SBI, inter alia : notes that it is essential for individuals serving on constituted bodies to be able to perform their official functions effectively; requests the UNFCCC Executive Secretary to continue consultations with the UN Secretary-General on how to best extend immunities under the 1946 Convention to individuals serving on Kyoto Protocol constituted bodies and expert review teams, and on whether the COP/MOP could invite the UN General Assembly to adopt a resolution to this effect; requests the UNFCCC Executive Secretary to report on the outcome of these consultations at SB 25, and to prepare a note for SB 25 analyzing, inter alia, the practical and legal implications of obtaining written agreement from private entities participating in CDM and JI to settle claims against individuals serving on constituted bodies or expert review teams in accordance with the decisions of the COP/MOP and at the Secretariat's headquarters, and of providing assistance upon request to such individuals faced with complaints concerning their official functions; and decides to consider this matter at SB 25 on the basis of this report and note by the Executive Secretary and to prepare a draft COP/MOP 2 decision taking into account views expressed by parties."
