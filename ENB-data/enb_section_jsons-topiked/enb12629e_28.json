    "As delegates gathered for the first time in the brand new World Conference Center Bonn, under construction for nearly a decade, many felt the pressure to finalize the \u201cconstruction work\u201d on the text of the Paris agreement.", 
    "Some participants, however, reported apprehension that many coordination meetings preceding the Bonn Climate Change Conference had been \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cvery difficult.\u201d Others noted that working throughout the day in two parallel negotiating groups under the ADP entailed a lot of legwork for smaller delegations. As delegates prepared to engage in the evening\u2019s facilitated discussions on parts of the 90-page negotiating text, one seasoned observer remarked the need to eat this elephant \u201cbit by bit.\u201d Many, however, wondered whether the process could pick up the speed required to accomplish this complicated task in time for the Paris Climate Change Conference."
