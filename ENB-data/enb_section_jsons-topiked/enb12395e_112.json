    "Along with the Pozna\u00c5\u0084 work programme on technology transfer, the only concrete outcome of the Pozna\u00c5\u0084 conference was the operationalization of the Adaptation Fund.", 
    "The COP/MOP adopted several decisions to make the Fund operational, including on arrangements with the Global Environment Facility and World Bank.", 
    "Importantly, all three tracks to access funds - through implementing entities, accredited national entities, and direct access by parties - have been enabled.", 
    "The Fund is, therefore, expected to start financing adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries in the next year.", 
    "The success on the Adaptation Fund was tempered by the inability to secure additional resources for the Fund due to lack of agreement on extending the share of proceeds (or adaptation levy ) to Joint Implementation and emissions trading under the second review of the Protocol under Article 9.", 
    "As many had predicted, these consultations were difficult and were unable to produce an agreement, leading COP/MOP 4 to conclude the second review of the Protocol without any substantive outcome.", 
    "Most developing countries expressed deep disappointment at the failure to increase adaptation funding.", 
    "While many parties and private sector representatives had also hoped for improvements to the CDM under the Article 9 review, the lack of outcome on the review meant that the improvements negotiated in Pozna\u00c5\u0084 were not adopted.", 
    "The AWG-KP, however, agreed to further consider issues related to the mechanisms in the post-2012 period in its March/April session."
