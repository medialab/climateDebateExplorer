    "An informal meeting held last week in Frankfurt, sponsored by the government of Germany, formed the basis for closer cooperation between the secretariats of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the GEF.", 
    "According to one participant, relations between the GEF and the CBD are complicated by language in the convention stating that the GEF shall operate under the 'authority' of the CBD, as well as by the absence of an intersessional mechanism to discuss financial issues (unlike the FCCC).", 
    "The meeting established a process for consultations between the two bodies in a revised Memorandum of Understanding."
