    "The first meeting of the non-group on QELROS, chaired by Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil), considered two questions: which greenhouse gases (GHGs) to include in the agreement and whether to adopt a gross or net approach.", 
    "A draft paper is to be produced to reflect the two main arguments put forward regarding the gross approach.", 
    "On the question of which GHGs are to be covered, a group of developed country favored a 'basket' approach while other developed countries supported the inclusion of all gases.", 
    "The possibility of amending a protocol or legal instrument over time to bring new gases into the agreement was raised, as was the alternative approach of dealing with sources of gases rather than the gases themselves.", 
    "The Chair\u0092s draft text is expected for the next meeting.", 
    "Another approach would reportedly address all gases but adopt a schedule for tackling different GHGs over time."
