    "Clarifying the purpose and mandate of the discussion, Chair Stoycheva explained that while the SBSTA had provided a clear mandate, the SBI\u0092s guidance was not precise.", 
    "She said that Parties would determine the use of the SBI workshop\u0092s results at a later stage.", 
    "SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson added that the synergy discussions involve not only the Subsidiary Bodies but also the convention secretariats that focus on the overall strategic level. Janos Pasztor said the workshops were a forum for information sharing and noted that it was not expected to make recommendations.", 
    "One participant expressed preference for presenting the results of the workshops to the SBI and SBSTA as recommendations. Participants then discussed the need for more synergies at the international level, noting that there are over 500 existing MEAs.", 
    "One participant stressed the importance of identifying appropriate governance of the synergy process and suggested broadening participation in the JLG to secretariats of other conventions, while another expressed skepticism over the potential overlaps between existing processes. Another participant underlined the need to distinguish between synergies created for saving costs rather than synergies for creating value.", 
    "A third suggested defining indicators across conventions, which could be used in the definition of core data sets."
