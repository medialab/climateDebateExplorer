    "Much of the talk in the corridors Thursday evening was on the progress of the various negotiating groups in clearing the numerous remaining draft decisions and accompanying texts.", 
    "While success was reported in areas such as technology transfer, funding, LULUCF and adverse effects, talks on the mechanisms appeared to be moving at a less impressive pace, while those on compliance seemed to be stalled.", 
    "An overriding disagreement that resurfaced concerns the legal nature of the procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance.", 
    "While several participants at COP-6 Part II felt some Parties were trying to reinterpret Monday's result, sympathizers said the caution in some of Thursday's groups reflected a concern that the talks were running the risk of rushing through texts that could consequently be error-laden.", 
    "Although talks were ongoing late Thursday night, there was a feeling that in spite of some progress, completing work on all remaining texts by the end of Friday could be an unrealistic aim.", 
    "Delegates were also discussing rumors of a possible proposal to continue the meeting into Saturday in an effort to finish the work."
