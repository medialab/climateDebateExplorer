    "With a plea for prayers for the G-77/China negotiators attempting to agree on an internal position on the Protocol mechanisms, the joint contact group on mechanisms was adjourned yet again by Chair Chow.", 
    "The repeated adjournments prompted one observer to speculate that the 'G' in G-77 should come to signify 'Godot,' as in 'Waiting for Godot.", 
    "' Some reported that the G-77/China is experiencing difficulty with the 'nature and scope' of the CDM itself, including what it constitutes, whether certified emission reductions should be 'tradeable' and whether a portion of project proceeds should go towards an 'adaptation' fund.", 
    "Some participants suggested that with few opportunities to meet intersessionally and an unwillingness to dissolve into regional positions, the G-77/China might be unable to agree on a comprehensive position in time for serious discussion at this meeting.", 
    "Some suggested that the Secretariat could help by playing a more 'facilitative role' in promoting intersessional dialogue between Parties within the G-77/China.", 
    "Against the backdrop of heated budget discussions and the fiscal discipline being demanded of the Secretariat, this may well be a tall order, leaving some observers wondering at the best way forward."
