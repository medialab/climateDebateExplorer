    "COP-8 can hardly be considered an overall success, yet it was by no means a complete failure.", 
    "While delegates reached agreement on the Delhi Declaration, it did not dispel the dichotomies.", 
    "These are certain to emerge again future negotiations.", 
    "Moreover, negotiators failed to provide additional guidance to the Special Climate Change Fund, and on issues like policies and measures, trade in cleaner energy and adverse effects, negotiators could not reach substantive conclusions.", 
    "These are already on the agenda for SB-18. On the positive side, many discussions relating to the implementation of existing commitments were successful.", 
    "In particular, Parties agreed on the rules and procedures for the CDM, concluded guidelines for reporting and review (Articles 5, 7 and 8), and provided additional guidance to the LDC Fund.", 
    "These important steps will further the implementation of both the UNFCCC and Protocol.", 
    "Moreover, although the Delhi Declaration did not initiate a formal dialogue on broadening future commitments, informal discussions have begun."
