    "At the end of two weeks of intense deliberations, delegates and observers may have good cause to feel concerned.", 
    "Political positions on the key issues remain entrenched, with little indication of willingness to compromise or move forward.", 
    "Some might argue that this was never the meeting's aim, suggesting that its core purpose was to develop negotiating text and narrow differences on technical matters.", 
    "But even on this more limited objective, progress was patchy.", 
    "While such text emerged on the key elements of the BAPA - mechanisms, compliance, adverse effects, technology transfer, LULUCF and policies and measures - all of these documents remain riddled with brackets.", 
    "In some cases negotiations almost ground to a halt, indicating an apparent unwillingness of Parties to make even relatively minor concessions.", 
    "With only eight weeks remaining, and with many technical and political questions needing to be resolved, observers are beginning to question whether COP-6 will succeed. The timing and location of the meeting was ironic.", 
    "While French Prime Minister Jospin's presence at SB-13 suggested some political commitment to making progress on climate change, his concessions in lowering taxes in response to the French fuel protests, which coincided with this meeting, highlight the political difficulties in implementing effective climate policies."
