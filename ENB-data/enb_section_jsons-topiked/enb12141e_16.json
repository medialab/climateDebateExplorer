    "Stephan Singer, Head of WWF's European Climate and Energy Policy Office, discussed Article 3.4 activities and repercussions on the integrity of the Protocol.", 
    "He said Parties should agree to: prohibit projects and credits without agreed inventories and independent monitoring; address leakage and permanence concerns; and exclude commercial forestry and business-as- usual projects.", 
    "He expressed concern that industrialized countries might attempt to negotiate an agreement at COP-6 that would effectively allow CO2 emissions to increase by 25-50%.", 
    "He drew attention to a report on technical and additional potentials for activities under Article 3.4 relating to sequestration by cropland, rangeland and forest management, which concluded that Article 3.4 activities could create significant new entitlements for countries with large landmasses, as well as the potential for serious loopholes."
