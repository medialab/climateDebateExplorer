    "COP-10 was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 6-18 December 2004.", 
    "The meeting involved lengthy negotiations on how to engage on commitments to combat climate change in the post-2012 period.", 
    "The Kyoto Protocol requires Parties to begin considering the post-2012 period by 2005.", 
    "Delegates eventually agreed to hold a Seminar of Governmental Experts prior to SB-22 in May 2005.", 
    "However, the terms of reference for the Seminar did not refer to the post-2012 period or new commitments.", 
    "Rather, they stated that the purpose of the Seminar was to promote 'an informal exchange of information on: (a) actions relating to mitigation and adaptation to assist Parties to continue to develop effective and appropriate responses to climate change; and (b) policies and measures adopted by their respective governments that support implementation of their existing commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "' Delegates also agreed on a package on adaptation - the Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures - supporting further implementation of measures to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, while also addressing calls for economic diversification for countries affected by the global community\u0092s response measures to deal with climate change. In addition, Parties addressed and adopted numerous decisions and conclusions on issues such as technology transfer, land-use change and forestry, the UNFCCC\u0092s financial mechanism, and education, training and public awareness.", 
    "Some issues remain unresolved, and will be taken up again in 2005.", 
    "These include negotiations on the LDC Fund, the SCCF, national communications from developing countries (non-Annex I Parties), and Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures)."
