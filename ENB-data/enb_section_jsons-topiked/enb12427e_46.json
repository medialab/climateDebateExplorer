    "The next stop on the road to Copenhagen will be Bangkok at the end of September.", 
    "There will be other stops - some of them outside the UNFCCC process, such as the UN Secretary-General s High-Level Event on Climate Change and the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh in the United States, both scheduled to take place the week before Bangkok.", 
    "These parallel processes are in fact where many are looking for much-needed political guidance.", 
    "However, even these high-level meetings are not without dispute, as some have questioned the appropriateness of bringing ideas from these processes into the UNFCCC negotiations.", 
    "Most would agree that, without significant process in Bangkok, reaching agreement in Copenhagen will be extremely difficult.", 
    "Bonn III may have just achieved the bare minimum needed to begin real negotiations in Bangkok: even though the AWG-LCA s impressive brick will still travel to Asia with the parties, the negotiating text will arrive in Bangkok alongside a number of reading guides, consolidated sections and other tools aimed at making it more accessible.", 
    "Nevertheless, with the ticking of the clock to Copenhagen getting louder by the minute, and, with just five weeks of official negotiating sessions remaining, those hoping for an agreement in December know there is not a minute to waste.", 
    "As one delegate aptly put it Time is not our friend."
