    "Negotiations on the elements of a mandate for consultations on commitments continued throughout the day and night.", 
    "By mid-day, one member of the so-called 'Green Group' reported that the negotiations were proceeding relatively well, while one developed country representative commented that negotiations were going from bad to worse.", 
    "Environmental NGOs in the corridors outside of Room 7 expressed concern that the result of these consultations would be merely an 'empty mandate.", 
    "' Nevertheless, negotiations continued despite the storming of the room by the press at 5:00 pm.", 
    "All that was certain as the night wore on was that delegates and certain steadfast or persistent NGOs had another long night ahead of them."
