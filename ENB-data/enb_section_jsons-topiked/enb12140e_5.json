    "Thomas H\u00e4usler, Remote Sensing Expert from the Company for Applied Remote Sensing (GAF), presented on earth observation in the context of LULUCF applications.", 
    "He highlighted, inter alia, the reliability and cost benefits of using remote sensing to provide data for forest inventories and to monitor afforestation, reforestation and deforestation at frequent intervals.", 
    "He stressed the need for a standardized nomenclature and harmonized technical procedures.", 
    "He noted, however, that remote sensing cannot be used to measure carbon stocks, and suggested the use of appropriate indicators. Ian Carruthers, Australian Greenhouse Office, made a presentation outlining Australia's perspective on carbon accounting for LULUCF.", 
    "He said land areas would enter into an accounting system for Article 3.3 and 3.4 once eligible LULUCF activities were established on that land.", 
    "He suggested that, once the land area entered into the accounting framework, all changes in greenhouse gases and carbon stocks from all relevant pools should be included, and the land should remain within the system into future commitment periods.", 
    "He expressed a preference for a narrow approach to the selection of activities and land-based accounting.", 
    "He drew attention to Australia's work on developing a national carbon accounting system, which he said could be applicable to other countries."
