    "On Articles 5, 7 and 8, Chair Dovland highlighted two issues delegates had been unable to resolve, namely reporting on LULUCF activities, and review and consequences of failure to report on Article 3.14.", 
    "He suggested that, with the completion of the work on compliance, this issue might be more easily resolved, and noted that the group's work on Article 7.4 could not be finalized until related work in the mechanisms group had been completed."
