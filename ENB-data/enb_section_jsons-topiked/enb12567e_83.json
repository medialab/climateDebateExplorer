    "On the Convention side, the AWG-LCA came to a rather anti-climactic demise in Doha, devoid of the excitement and resounding applause accompanying its birth five years ago when the Bali Action Plan (BAP) was adopted at COP 13.", 
    "At that time, weary but good-spirited delegates headed home, heralding COP 13 as a breakthrough, stewarding a new era of multilateralism.", 
    "After lengthy and difficult negotiations, delegates had agreed on a two-year process- or Bali Road Map- a set of decisions aimed at finalizing a post 2012-regime by Copenhagen in December 2009.", 
    "The Bali Road Map was ostensibly about addressing some of the shortcomings of the Kyoto Protocol, particularly the US refusal to join a treaty that did not require emission reductions from major developing country emitters.", 
    "In the meantime, the global economic landscape has been changing beyond recognition and China and India s rising carbon emissions are increasingly under sustained scrutiny.", 
    "At its birth, the BAP was seen as progressive, because for the first time it introduced the notion of developed and developing countries, under the Convention as opposed to Annex I and non-Annex I parties.", 
    "This new categorization opened up the possibility of differentiation according to levels of economic development among developing countries, a nascent concept at that time.", 
    "Fast-forward two years, and instead of adopting a new protocol at COP 15 in Copenhagen, the fractious meeting nearly collapsed with parties in the end merely agreeing to take note of the Copenhagen Accord.", 
    "The AWG-LCA s mandate was extended for another year and subsequently renewed at both COP 16 and COP 17, where parties finally agreed to terminate the AWG-LCA at COP 18.", 
    "Leading up to Doha, speculation had been rife that there would be no agreement on closing the AWG-LCA, if its work was not deemed to be satisfactorily completed.", 
    "Negotiations under the AWG-LCA in Doha at times appeared haphazard- even chaotic- leaving many delegates second guessing AWG-LCA Chair Tayeb s intentions and modus operandi.", 
    "Agreement appeared elusive, especially with finance and loss and damage still up in the air and only a weak framework for Annex I countries mitigation.", 
    "Ultimately, after intense consultations and trade-offs, the AWG-LCA completed its work as scheduled.", 
    "But what is the AWG-LCA s legacy?", 
    "Was it able to deliver on its promises or were delegates naively aspirational in 2007?", 
    "In Bali, even if anchored in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, both developing and developed countries ultimately agreed to undertake mitigation efforts.", 
    "In a historic move, developing countries agreed to nationally appropriate mitigation actions in the context of sustainable development, supported by technology and enabled by finance and capacity building in a measureable, reportable and verifiable manner.", 
    "Developed countries meanwhile agreed to undertake, measurable, reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation commitments or actions, including QELROs, while ensuring the comparability of efforts among them, taking into account differences in their national circumstances.", 
    "Since Copenhagen, over 85 developing and developed countries presented emission reduction pledges under the Convention.", 
    "However, many of these pledges are unclear, contain targets to be achieved on conditionalities and wide ranges of possible reductions proposed.", 
    "As one commentator noted, five years down the line, mitigation under the AWG-LCA has increasingly devolved from a top-down to a race-to-the-bottom approach, and, he added, characterized by a pledge and report system, with emphasis on reporting mitigation actions through national communications and inventory reports.", 
    "Agreement in Doha under mitigation for developed countries urges them to increase the ambition of their quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets to levels recommended by science and establishes a work programme to continue clarifying these pledges.", 
    "The work programme is aimed at identifying common elements for ensuring progress towards emission reduction targets and comparability of efforts.", 
    "The decision does not refer to the establishment of common accounting rules, methodologies and common base years for developed countries, lamented one developing country delegate.", 
    "Assessing comparability of mitigation efforts among Annex I parties is key for many reasons, including for maintaining robust international carbon markets.", 
    "This decision has left many questioning the commitment of developed countries to raising the level of ambition.", 
    "On the side of developing country mitigation, Doha also establishes a work programme to further the understanding of the diversity of NAMAs, which for many, is a long way short of addressing the runaway emissions of several emerging economies.", 
    "If anything, the AWG-LCA has fashioned an entirely new institutional landscape under the Convention.", 
    "Doha endorsed Sondgo, Republic of Korea, as the Green Climate Fund s (GCF) host.", 
    "The Standing Committee on Finance is also firmly established.", 
    "Under technology, a mechanism was created and Doha confirmed a UNEP-led consortium as the host of the Climate Technology Centre (CTC).", 
    "The Adaptation Committee was established to work on adaptation.", 
    "When the concept of loss and damage was first proposed by AOSIS during the AWG-LCA negotiations several years ago, it seemed inconceivable then that parties would eventually agree in Doha to develop institutional arrangements to compensate developing countries for loss and damage caused by slow onset events, such as sea level rise.", 
    "Finance has always been the linchpin of the negotiations.", 
    "While the Copenhagen Accord provided for fast-start finance up to 2012 and the mobilization of US$100 billion both for adaptation and mitigation by 2020, the agreement was silent on financing during the period 2012-2020.", 
    "This mid-term gap has preoccupied the hearts and minds of many during every negotiating session over the last few years.", 
    "The agreement reached in Doha encourages developed countries to increase efforts to provide finance between 2013 and 2015 at the same levels as provided during the fast-start period.", 
    "For many, this falls considerably short of the MRV of financial support envisaged in the wake of Bali.", 
    "The agreement also extends the mandate of the work programme on long-term finance by one year, where efforts to scale up the mobilization of climate finance will be considered.", 
    "Although the GCF has been established, without a concrete signal on its replenishment, many see it as just an empty shell.", 
    "At the end of the day the success of the AWG-LCA s outcome will be judged by how effectively these new institutions can implement their mandates and enable developing countries to address climate change challenges."
