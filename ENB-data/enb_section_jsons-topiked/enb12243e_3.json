    "The guidelines require Annex I Parties to provide information on: national circumstances relevant to greenhouse gas emissions and removals; greenhouse gas inventories; vulnerability assessments, climate change impacts and adaptation measures; financial resources and transfer of technology; research and systematic observation; and education, training and public awareness. The national communications also request information on policies and measures (P&Ms) implemented by Parties to mitigate emissions, and projections of emissions estimates up to 2020 for all sectors.", 
    "The majority of Annex I Parties are now in the process of preparing their fourth national communications, due for submission by 1 January 2006."
