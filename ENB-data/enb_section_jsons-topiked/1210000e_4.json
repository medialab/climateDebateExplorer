    "The Contact Group discussing the physical location of the Permanent Secretariat met Thursday afternoon with the representatives of the four countries offering to host the Secretariat - Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Uruguay.", 
    "While some members of the Group said they had made progress, it appeared as though the Contact Group was not yet in a position to make a recommendation to the Plenary on this matter.", 
    "It seems that a number of delegations do not have instructions from their capitals on location preferences, should this matter come to a vote on Friday.", 
    "If the INC is not able to make a recommendation to the COP, it is likely that the decision will not be taken at COP-1.", 
    "In that case, it may be some time before the Permanent Secretariat has a permanent home."
