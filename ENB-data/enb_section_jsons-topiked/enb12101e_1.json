    "On compliance under the Protocol, the G-77/CHINA said Annex I Parties\u0092 communications should include information on Convention implementation, particularly: policies and measures to modify longer term trends; new and additional finance; assistance to meet adaptation costs; technology transfer; and capacity building of developing countries.", 
    "AOSIS expressing disappointment at the overall increase in Annex I Parties\u0092 emissions, proposed that COP-5 review implementation of Annex I Party commitments.", 
    "The EU said this meeting could make progress on, inter alia: implementation of Annex I Party FCCC commitments; development and transfer of technology; further elaboration of the Protocol mechanisms, giving priority to the clean development mechanism (CDM); and development of a strong and efficient compliance system.", 
    "The AFRICAN GROUP, emphasized Africa\u0092s special needs relating to adaptation to adverse effects, capacity building and technology transfer.", 
    "He advocated an early start to the CDM.", 
    "Chair Kante said that a Joint Working Group, chaired by Harald Dovland (Norway) and Espen R\u00f8nnenberg (Marshall Islands), would continue consideration of the issue. On AIJ under the pilot phase, the G-77/CHINA and others expressed concern at the lack of regional balance in projects.", 
    "The AFRICAN GROUP and NORWAY called for capacity building to remedy this, particularly in Africa.", 
    "AOSIS said AIJ project experience internationally was inadequate for a meaningful review.", 
    "SWITZERLAND called for development of terms of reference for the review of the pilot phase for consideration by COP-5.", 
    "The US, with JAPAN and GUATEMALA, said experiences gained from AIJ projects could provide valuable lessons for Protocol mechanism development.", 
    "She noted the need for a smooth transition from the pilot phase to project-based mechanisms.", 
    "COSTA RICA underscored the role of AIJ projects in its sustainable development agenda, and called on COP-5 to take a definitive decision on AIJ\u0092s status.", 
    "GUATEMALA, with BRAZIL, supported AIJ project eligibility for CDM certification, if the project meets the necessary criteria and, with RUSSIA, called for straightforward guidelines for the certification system.", 
    "As AIJ does not include a credit element and lacks adequate reference to sustainable development, IRAN opposed linking it with CDM. On the Protocol mechanisms, the G-77/CHINA stressed the need to, inter alia: begin with formulating principles to guide the methodological and operational process; establish a common understanding of the mechanisms; and ensure that the nature and scope of mechanisms do not perpetuate North-South inequities.", 
    "Stating that mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic action, the EU noted the need to ensure that they do not undermine commitments under the Protocol.", 
    "She advocated for a properly defined ceiling that will encourage Annex B countries to define strong policies and measures. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) reported on a recent CDM workshop held in Dakar, Senegal.", 
    "The workshop conclusions highlighted, inter alia, that: CDM should act as a catalyst for sustainable development; studies on Protocol mechanisms should be extended to all African countries; a wide spectrum of projects and private sector involvement should be promoted; and capacity building of negotiators, companies, potential certifiers and others involved in CDM should be encouraged. On the Protocol mechanisms, CHINA said the synthesis of proposals on emissions trading contained several extraneous elements, such as competitiveness and market size, and called for a revised synthesis.", 
    "The US, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, NORWAY, NEW ZEALAND and CANADA opposed the EU proposal to place caps on the use of the Protocol mechanisms.", 
    "They said, inter alia, that the proposal would: re-open the 'package' agreed in Kyoto; reduce the flow of new resources to developing countries; impede the cost effectiveness of the mechanisms; hinder wider acceptance of the Protocol by domestic constituencies; and create a double standard by not clarifying how it applies to Article 4 (EU 'bubble').", 
    "SWITZERLAND proposed a post-verification system for emissions trading that allows Parties to trade only the excess of assigned amount units.", 
    "Certificates for these excess units, to be issued by the Secretariat, would automatically be valid.", 
    "Supported by KAZAKHSTAN, he proposed that JI begin prior to 2008. The AFRICAN GROUP, supported setting caps on the use of mechanisms to meet Protocol commitments and said the CDM should avoid replicating the inequitable regional distribution of projects experienced during the AIJ pilot phase.", 
    "AOSIS said that actions under the mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic action and, with SENEGAL, indicated that the mechanisms be guided by equity and transparency principles. On capacity building, SWITZERLAND called for an overview of past and ongoing initiatives on AIJ and the mechanisms.", 
    "The EU suggested focussing on awareness raising and information regarding the design of options for the mechanisms.", 
    "With regard to proposed action, she suggested a clearer division of labor between the relevant bodies and institutions.", 
    "Chair Chow suggested he chair a joint contact group on mechanisms and established an informal group on AIJ, co-chaired by the EC and Zimbabwe."
