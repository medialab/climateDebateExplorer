    "The AWG-KP focused its work on one main agenda item: consideration of further commitments for Annex I parties under the Protocol (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/9-10; FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/INF.2/Rev.1; FCCC/TP/2010/3; FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/Miscs.", 
    "Under this item, parties met in plenary and held contact groups and informal consultations on the following issues: scale of emission reductions from Annex I parties (also known as the numbers group); legal issues, including a possible gap between the Protocol s first commitment period (2008-2012) and subsequent commitment periods; other issues, including LULUCF, the flexibility mechanisms, and methodological issues; and potential consequences of response measures of climate change.", 
    "These discussions ended with parties forwarding a new Chair s proposal (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/CRP.2) that contains a series of draft decisions to serve as the basis for continued negotiations.", 
    "This section outlines the discussions and draft outcomes on each of the issues considered.", 
    "Annex I emission reductions: On this issue (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/6/Add.1), work began with an in-session workshop on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning on the scale of emissions reductions to be achieved by Annex I parties in aggregate and the contribution of Annex I parties, individually or jointly to this scale.", 
    "Discussions during the subsequent contact groups focused on: raising the level of ambition of Annex I pledges; translating pledges into QELROs; implications of technical rules on LULUCF, mechanisms and carryover of surplus assigned amount units (AAUs); the scale of emission reductions; length and number of commitment periods; and base or reference years.", 
    "During the in-session workshop, three panel sessions addressed: the current level of pledges and the scale of emission reductions by Annex I parties in aggregate; the quantitative implications of LULUCF, emission trading and project-based mechanisms on the emission reductions by Annex I parties in aggregate, ensuring national circumstances are taken into consideration, and their implications on emission reductions by Annex I Parties in aggregate; and enhancing transparency of pledges for emission reductions of Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "A summary of the workshop will be annexed to the report of the session (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/L.5).", 
    "For full coverage, see http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12474e.html and http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12475e.html During the ensuing negotiations in the contact group on Annex I emission reductions, co-chaired by Leon Charles (Grenada) and J\u00fcrgen Lefevere (EU), parties explored various options and their implications on emission reductions, and moved paragraph-by-paragraph through the issues in the text.", 
    "On the aggregate level of ambition , the G-77/China emphasized a top-down approach, with India and China noting that it was needed in the absence of adequate pledges.", 
    "AOSIS said the 17-25% pledged by Annex I parties would result in effective emission reductions of only 1-7% when all the technical rules are considered.", 
    "Australia and New Zealand said this issue cannot be clarified at this time, since it depends on the legal and methodological context.", 
    "Australia said parties had agreed to an iterative approach, rather than top-down or bottom-up.", 
    "Japan emphasized that their pledges only exist in the context of a comprehensive agreement including all major emitters.", 
    "On impact of technical rules on aggregate ambition , Co-Chair Charles identified ranges and options emerging from discussions, the Chair s note and party submissions.", 
    "The implications of these ranges and options on aggregate emission reductions, as well as options for addressing them, were the primary topic of discussions in this contact group.", 
    "Options to address the impact of the carryover of surplus AAUs included using existing rules, demand or supply side measures, using a cap or restricting use, or employing levies.", 
    "On LULUCF, parties discussed, inter alia : using existing rules; limiting use of, or removing, LULUCF credits from the system; removing the surplus AAUs where they include LULUCF credits; or not using the LULUCF provisions of Protocol Article 3.7 (translating QELROs into AAUs).", 
    "On certified emission reductions (CERs), parties discussed using current rules and introducing new mechanisms, strengthening additionality of CERs, or imposing a cap on mechanisms and supplementarity, to address the impacts of rules on flexibility mechanisms.", 
    "Following these discussions, Co-Chair Charles noted the need for a detailed outline of options on surplus AAUs.", 
    "He also indicated that options for LULUCF would benefit from joint discussions with the LULUCF contact group and said additional discussions on mechanisms would be useful.", 
    "On the length and number of commitment periods and base year , the G-77/China, supported by AOSIS and the African Group, preferred a single five-year commitment period with a base year of 1990.", 
    "AOSIS said this would allow for adjustment of targets based on recent science but that an eight-year period could be considered if Annex I parties increased their pledges dramatically.", 
    "The EU, Japan, Australia and other developed countries preferred a single eight-year commitment period with flexibility on reference years.", 
    "On transforming pledges into QELROs , the G-77/China proposed a mixed approach, with QELROs for countries with emissions higher than the first commitment period QELRO using the QELRO from the first commitment period as the basis for the calculation, and countries with emissions lower than the first commitment period QELRO using their current level of emissions to translate their pledges.", 
    "Many developed countries said QELROs are subject to negotiation rather than to a decision on methods to calculate them.", 
    "Japan and the Russian Federation emphasized that QELROs should be seen in the broader context of a comprehensive agreement.", 
    "The ideas and proposals outlined above were incorporated by the AWG-KP Chair into his draft proposal on 6 August (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/CRP.2).", 
    "During the AWG-KP closing plenary, contact group Co-Chair Charles said the AWG-KP Chair s text would serve as the basis for further negotiations at AWG-KP 14, to be held in October in Tianjin, China.", 
    "Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF): This issue was taken up briefly in plenary on Monday and subsequently in a contact group and informal consultations held throughout the week and facilitated by Marcelo Rocha (Brazil) and Peter Iversen (Denmark).", 
    "Discussions were based on a Chair s note (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/6/Add.2).", 
    "During these discussions, delegates exchanged views and presented four proposals from parties on: accounting for forest management; force majeure (which means an extraordinary event or circumstance whose occurrence or severity is beyond the control of parties); use of harvested wood products; and including and reviewing the reference levels for accounting of emissions and removals from forest management.", 
    "On force majeure , a proposal was presented by Australia, Canada, the EU and the Russian Federation, identifying key elements of what might constitute force majeure .", 
    "The proposal included a definition and accounting rules for force majeure .", 
    "On harvested wood products (HWPs), the Chair s note included two options: either developing a set of rules on HWPs under LULUCF, or excluding the HWPs section.", 
    "New Zealand strongly supported making progress on HWPs and considering principles of environmental integrity and transparency.", 
    "However, some parties raised questions or concerns about the section.", 
    "Belarus, Singapore and other developing countries noted concerns with avoiding double emissions accounting and tracking information.", 
    "China with other developing countries requested clarification on potential implications for forestry and other sectors.", 
    "The concern of potential implications was also raised by Tuvalu, who warned about the potential perverse incentives for the conversion of natural forests into productive ones.", 
    "Brazil raised questions about HWPs in the context of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), particularly relating to additionality.", 
    "Following these discussions, a proposal on HWPs was presented to the co-facilitators by Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, the Russian Federation and Switzerland.", 
    "The proposal included emissions accountability for HWP-producing countries, accountability measures to avoid gaps and provisions for the sustainable use of HWPs.", 
    "Parties also discussed the definition, baselines and target years for forest management reference levels.", 
    "Many developing countries expressed concern over the methodology to determine reference levels, observing that Annex I parties reference levels diverge from countries historical forest management levels and urging transparency through clear data and objective review processes.", 
    "Developed countries were generally somewhat cautious about the G-77/China s proposed review process, but suggested guidelines, a standardization process and further discussions.", 
    "On Friday, Australia presented a draft proposal to the group that would involve the SBSTA in the review process.", 
    "However, developing countries expressed concerns about the idea.", 
    "Both the review process of forest management reference levels and caps on forest management were identified as key issues to address at AWG-KP 14 in October.", 
    "The discussions on LULUCF resulted in a non-paper that was drafted and presented on Thursday.", 
    "The non-paper included a revised version of the original Chair s note and the proposals submitted by parties.", 
    "Delegates focused on streamlining the text during the remainder of their discussions, including references to methodological consistency in forest accounting with reference levels, and removing an option on land management accounting.", 
    "The group s work was incorporated in the AWG-KP Chair s text that was forwarded to the next session during the closing plenary.", 
    "Flexibility mechanisms: This issue was taken up on Wednesday during informal consultations facilitated by AWG-KP Vice-Chair Adrian Macey (New Zealand).", 
    "Discussions focused on the Chair\u00b4s note on the flexibility mechanisms (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/6/Add.3), with parties suggesting minor amendments.", 
    "The proposals covered a range of topics, including: CCS under the CDM; nuclear facilities under the CDM; standardized baselines; CERs; discount factors; joint implementation (JI); co-benefits of CDM and JI; carryover of AAUs; share of proceeds for CERs issuance; emissions trading; new market mechanisms; wording of proposal on quantitative limit on supplementarity; and increased use of CERs from certain host countries with less than a certain amount of CDM projects.", 
    "During the closing AWG-KP plenary, Vice-Chair Macey reported that only limited revisions were included in the revised text due to the fact that it was already well developed, with clear options established during earlier sessions.", 
    "However, he emphasized that parties still need to work hard to bridge the remaining gaps.", 
    "Methodological issues: This issue (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/6/Add.4) was addressed in a contact group and informal consultations.", 
    "Parties worked through the text and made minor amendments.", 
    "In the final contact group meeting on Friday, AWG-KP Vice-Chair Adrian Macey noted that while this work had not been incorporated into AWG-KP s new Chair s text, he expected that it would serve as the basis for discussions at AWG-KP 14 in October.", 
    "He said successive readings of the text may no longer be useful and encouraged identification of packages of issues that can be resolved together.", 
    "Legal matters: This issue was taken up primarily in a contact group co-chaired by Gerhard Loibl (Austria) and Daniel Ortega (Ecuador).", 
    "The group considered a paper on legal considerations relating to a possible gap between the first and subsequent commitment periods (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/10).", 
    "Parties requested the Secretariat to prepare this paper at the June session.", 
    "During the group s discussions, a representative of the Secretariat emphasized that the text should not be viewed as a plan B by the UN or the Secretariat and that it is the parties that will determine how to apply and implement the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "Some developing countries, including Saudi Arabia and Bolivia, stressed that their participation in these sessions should not be interpreted as accepting a possible gap.", 
    "Many developing countries also preferred keeping the focus on the agreement for a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol and finishing the AWG-KP s work in a timely manner.", 
    "China questioned the value of the legal issues discussions, observing that based on Annex I parties previous statements in negotiations, they do not appear eager to continue the Kyoto Protocol at all.", 
    "Australia and the EU responded that all efforts should be made to avoid the gap.", 
    "On legal options for addressing the gap between commitment periods , the Secretariat s paper addressed, inter alia : changing the amendment procedures to allow for expedited entry into force; provisional application of amendments as provided for in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties; and possible extension of the first commitment period.", 
    "New Zealand, the EU and Australia expressed concerns on the provisional application of amendments.", 
    "However, the African Group declared that the Kyoto Protocol without an Annex B is a dead body and urged adoption of provisions considering the provisional application of an amendment.", 
    "Japan underscored that creating a new legal framework that is fairer and more effective is the best way to address the gap issue.", 
    "On the implications of a possible gap , the Secretariat noted that if mechanisms or institutions are characterized as assisting parties in meeting their obligations under Article 3.1, then it is doubtful they would continue to exist without a second commitment period.", 
    "Australia said a gap would not prevent the continuation of key elements of the Protocol, such as the CDM and JI.", 
    "The EU agreed that it is up to parties to decide and that he believes the CDM will continue.", 
    "He emphasized that 80% of global emissions trading is based on the EU s Emissions Trading Scheme, which will continue operating regardless of a gap in commitment periods.", 
    "Many developing countries highlighted that the report was of value but that it should be considered for information purposes only.", 
    "In the closing plenary, several parties noted that the interpretation of the Kyoto Protocol is the prerogative of parties.", 
    "Potential consequences of response measures: This issue (FCCC/AWG/2010/6/Add.5) was first addressed in a contact group on Monday.", 
    "Discussions in the contact group focused on the question of establishing a permanent forum or using existing channels, including national communications.", 
    "Brazil, for the G-77/China, said a permanent forum is necessary to report, evaluate and address the specific needs and concerns of non-Annex I countries.", 
    "He said information could come from national communications but also from other documents and reports.", 
    "New Zealand and the EU said this might duplicate the work of the SBI in reviewing national communications and might infringe on parties sovereign rights.", 
    "The EU noted that information needs to come from both developing and developed countries, and said the issue should be addressed under SBI and SBSTA.", 
    "The work of the group was integrated into the new Chair s draft proposal released on Friday, and will serve as the basis for further negotiations.", 
    "Outcome document: Draft proposal by the Chair : On Friday, AWG-KP Chair John Ashe distributed a draft proposal on the consideration of further commitments for Annex I parties under the Kyoto Protocol (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/CRP.2).", 
    "The text contains five chapters with draft decision text on: amendments to the Kyoto Protocol pursuant to Article 3.9 (further commitments for Annex I Parties); LULUCF; flexibility mechanisms; the basket of methodological issues; and potential consequences.", 
    "Some parties noted that the draft decision texts closely reflect the Notes by the Chair prepared to facilitate negotiations on these issues (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/6 and Adds.", 
    "1-5) and the proposals and textual refinements made during negotiations throughout AWG-KP 13.", 
    "Revisions to text in the Chair s notes made following the release of the Chair s proposal, particularly those on basket of methodological issues (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/6/Add.4) and co-facilitator s non-paper on LULUCF, will be revised and reissued prior to AWG-KP 14 in October.", 
    "Chapter 1 contains a draft decision on amendments to the Kyoto Protocol pursuant to its Article 3.9, including options to amend Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol, which lists Annex I parties QELROs.", 
    "In addition, it contains two options to amend elements of Article 3 and 4 to establish a second commitment period.", 
    "The second alternative also contains options to amend other articles, including on: review of the provisions of the protocol in light of the long-term goal for emission reductions; share of proceeds; accountability of emissions trading; compliance; new market mechanisms; as well as proposed changes to the list of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A.", 
    "Chapter 2 contains a draft decision on LULUCF including options on: relevant definitions; accounting for forest management; CDM eligibility; force majeure ; HWPs; and reference levels.", 
    "Chapter 3 contains a draft decision on emissions trading and the project-based mechanisms (flexibility mechanisms) including options on: CCS under the CDM; nuclear facilities under the CDM and JI; standardized baselines; use of CERs from project activities in certain host parties; discount factors under the CDM; co-benefits under the CDM and JI; share of proceeds; and additional market-based mechanisms.", 
    "Chapter 4 includes a draft decision containing options for new greenhouse gases, sectors and source categories, common metrics to calculate the carbon dioxide equivalence of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks, and other methodological issues (basket of methodological issues).", 
    "Chapter 5 contains a draft decision on consideration of information on potential environmental, economic and social consequences, including spillover effects of tools, policies, measures and methodologies available to Annex I parties (potential consequences).", 
    "The sole outstanding issue in the text is a set of options on either establishing a permanent forum or use of existing channels, including national communications, to address potential consequences."
