    "Since its inception, the IPCC has played an important role in the formulation of policy to address climate change.", 
    "This is particularly reflected by the catalytic impact of the IPCC\u0092s First Assessment Report in 1990 in generating the impetus leading to the adoption of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992.", 
    "Hence, the relationship between the IPCC and the UNFCCC has always been close, with the UNFCCC relying heavily the IPCC\u0092s outputs and the IPCC looking the UNFCCC for mandates on special reports.", 
    "The resulting balance between scientific and political agendas has led to suggestions that this forum might be more efficient if it involved only scientists striving for the highest standard of science, or only policymakers familiar with the UNFCCC process, which would ensure that participants are speaking the same 'language.", 
    "' However, many point to the participation of both scientists and policymakers as a key characteristic of the IPCC, and extol the inclusive and interactive nature of the intergovernmental process."
