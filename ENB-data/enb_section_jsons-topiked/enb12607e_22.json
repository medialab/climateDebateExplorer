    "Regarding a headline statement stating that 'a combination of adaptation and substantial, sustained reductions in GHG emissions can limit climate change risks', Saudi Arabia, supported by El Salvador, proposed either moving the word 'substantial' to qualify both adaptation and emission reductions, or reverting to WGII SPM language.", 
    "Saint Lucia, opposed by Canada, proposed an additional sentence from the WGII SPM, stating that some risk from adverse impacts will remain for all levels of adaptation and mitigation.", 
    "The Panel did not take onboard these suggestions, and the headline statement was agreed with slight modifications proposed by authors.", 
    "Final SYR SPM Text: The headline states that continued GHG emissions will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in the climate system, and that limiting climate change requires substantial and sustained GHG reductions."
