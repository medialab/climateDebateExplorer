    "Reporting on its LULUCF work programme, the IPCC noted a recent task force meeting and its work plan for the upcoming year. The FAO reported conclusions from an expert meeting held in January on harmonizing forest-related definitions for use by various stakeholders, jointly organized with the IPCC, the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), and the International Union for Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO).", 
    "He reported four key messages from the workshop: the importance of universally- accepted definitions; the need to approve and adopt existing definitions before creating new ones; the general compatibility of the FAO\u0092s definitions with Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4 (LULUCF); and the fact that some definitions are incompatible with land use or the state of forests.", 
    "The EU supported the use of biome- specific forest definitions.", 
    "The US cautioned against creating separate definitions and urged coordination between different reporting bodies.",
