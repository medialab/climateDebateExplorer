    "In the dim light of the Nordic morning, in a picturesque post-industrial location in central Stockholm, the IPCC adopted the latest findings on the science of climate change.", 
    "Over four days and nights, the overview of these conclusions - the Summary for Policymakers - had been subject to intense line-by-line discussion by representatives of 116 governments present in Stockholm.", 
    "The WGI contribution is the first in a series of four that will comprise the Fifth Assessment Report.", 
    "The other three are the WGII assessment on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability (scheduled for endorsement in March 2014), the WGIII contribution on options for mitigating climate change (April 2014), and the Synthesis Report (October 2014).", 
    "The Fifth Assessment Report will provide the scientific basis for future global climate policy, including the new agreement that is supposed to be adopted by parties to the UNFCCC in 2015.", 
    "This brief analysis summarizes the main findings of the report, reflects on the SPM approval process, and places the meeting in the larger context of evolving global climate policy."
