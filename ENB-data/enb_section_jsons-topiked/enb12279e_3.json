    "Adaptation is a cross-cutting theme of the UNFCCC and is referred to in different articles.", 
    "In particular, Convention Article 4.1 states that parties shall 'formulate, implement, publish and regularly update national and, where appropriate, regional programmes containing measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change,' and 'cooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change.", 
    "' Convention Article 4.4 states that developed country parties shall 'assist the developing country parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects.", 
    "' While COP 1 in 1995 addressed funding for adaptation (decision 11/CP.1), it was not until the adoption of the Marrakesh Accords in 2001 that adaptation began to be more widely seen as a prominent area for action, as set out in decision 5/CP.7 (adverse effects of climate change). The actual process for the development of a structured programme of work on adaptation began in Milan at COP 9 in December 2003, following the conclusion of consideration of the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).", 
    "In what is sometimes referred to as the 'Milan process on adaptation,' COP 9 requested the SBSTA to initiate work on scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change (decision 10/CP.9).", 
    "SBSTA conducted one pre-sessional workshop on this matter at SBSTA 19 in December 2003, and two in-session workshops at SBSTA 20 and 21. With decision 1/CP.10 (Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures), parties reached a new milestone in terms of work on adaptation, as the COP called for SBSTA to develop a structured five-year programme of work on the scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change.", 
    "This request specified four general issues or thematic areas to be addressed by the programme of work: methodologies, data and modelling; vulnerability assessments; adaptation planning, measures and actions; and integration into sustainable development, in the context of the terms of reference of the SBSTA as referred to in Convention Article 9.", 
    "The COP also invited parties to submit their views on the programme of work and its implementation. Parties initiated deliberations on the programme of work in an in-session workshop at SBSTA 22 in May 2005.", 
    "The SBSTA Chair prepared a summary of this workshop containing possible elements of the programme of work to serve as the basis for further discussions.", 
    "These were taken up by a contact group, which continued deliberations on the objective, scope of work, process, structure, activities, modalities and review of the programme of work.", 
    "The contact group met six times and held numerous informal consultations.", 
    "However, the programme of work could not be completed at SBSTA 22, and the text was fully bracketed.", 
    "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/4), SBSTA agreed to further consider and elaborate at SBSTA 23 the draft COP decision and its draft annex containing the possible elements of the programme of work, with a view to forwarding a draft decision for adoption at COP 11.", 
    "To facilitate this, SBSTA also agreed to hold an informal workshop under the guidance of the Chair of the SBSTA before SBSTA 23, meeting in conjunction with COP 11 in Montreal, beginning on 28 November 2005."
