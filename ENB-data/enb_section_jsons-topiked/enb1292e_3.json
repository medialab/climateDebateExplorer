    "The contact group on the financial mechanism, chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) and Dan Reifsnyder (US), met to discuss additional guidance to and status of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF).", 
    "The group first discussed a draft decision presented by the G-77/CHINA (FCCC/CP/1998/MISC.3/Add.1).", 
    "While the EU supported the overall framework of the G-77/China draft decision, with the US, he said it should not include funding for stage II and III processes.", 
    "AUSTRALIA indicated that he might support stage II efforts now and stage III. The US tabled a draft decision that focused on: improvements at the operational level of the GEF; resolving the status of and guidance to the GEF in one draft decision; and GEF support programs to assist developing countries in altering their policy and legal frameworks in support of technology transfer.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA said this proposal did not adequately meet the needs of developing country Parties.", 
    "A smaller informal group will meet to draft a decision for the contact group to consider at their next meeting. The joint contact group on mechanisms, chaired by Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil) and Yvo de Boer (Netherlands) met on Friday to discuss a work programme prepared by the Co-Chairs.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA stressed the need for a clear section devoted to the nature and scope of the mechanisms to facilitate comparison.", 
    "He added that the mechanisms should not exacerbate the economic disadvantage of certain countries, and called for the CDM to be discussed on a priority basis.", 
    "HONDURAS, supported by several Latin American countries, suggested expeditious creation of the CDM, calling for an 'interim phase approach' to develop guidelines and rules.", 
    "The US stressed parallel progress on all mechanisms.", 
    "The EU preferred a general, rather than a detailed, debate.", 
    "NEW ZEALAND stressed the importance of developing a timeline for discussion.", 
    "Several Parties expressed concern about the length of the draft work programme.", 
    "SWITZERLAND provided the Chairs with a two-page work programme.", 
    "The contact group met on Saturday to continue discussion on the work programme, with a much-shortened version prepared by the Co-Chairs that included the Honduran 'interim phase' proposal.", 
    "After some discussion, the Chair acknowledged differences in views among the Parties, but said they were not incompatible.",

    "The G-77/CHINA presented the principles of the proposed technology transfer mechanism, drawing upon the US and EU proposals.", 
    "Further functions or features would be determined as the process develops.", 
    "The US reiterated its view on market based technology transfer, noting that the Kyoto Protocol places technology transfer and the market at the core of the deliberations.", 
    "Co-Chair Christ suggested the 'cat,' as the process was referred to, could represent consultation and capacity, access and advice on barrier removals and technology transfer.", 
    "She cautioned against duplication of ongoing activities, such as the preparation of the IPCC Special Report on Methodological and Technical Issues in Technology Transfer.", 
    "The PHILIPPINES questioned the need for further material compilations and said although market based transfer exists, it was not effective and required further measures.", 
    "The Co-Chair proposed that the Secretariat integrate the three proposals.", 
    "The delegates discussed the new draft at length and made significant progress.", 
    "On Saturday evening, the meeting adjourned to allow further consultations on the outstanding issues relating to what to call the process. The contact group on FCCC Article 4.2 (a) and (b) (review of adequacy of commitments), co-chaired by Jennifer Irish (Canada) and Margaret Mukahanana (Zimbabwe), met over the weekend.", 
    "A discussion of four draft proposals, presented by AUSTRALIA, the EU, G-77/CHINA and the US, dominated discussion.", 
    "Debate concerned procedural issues on how to address the texts, with the G-77/CHINA indicating its reluctance to consider a compilation text prepared by the Co-Chairs.", 
    "After extensive debate, the G-77/CHINA proposed, with the EU and NEW ZEALAND, a reworked text as a negotiating document.", 
    "The US, with the eventual support of G-77/CHINA, rejected the compilation document and called on the four draft decisions to be presented in their entirety to the SBI.", 
    "The Parties justified the cautious approach, citing this issue\u0092s crucial importance to national positions.", 
    "CHINA said he interpreted the US and AUSTRALIA proposals as an attempt to exact commitments from developing countries.", 
    "The US and AUSTRALIA noted that the scientific and technical evaluation from the IPCC indicated that developed country actions would be insufficient to meet the aims of the Convention, and the US incorporated this into its submission.", 
    "The meeting ended without clear resolution about the report the Co-Chairs should present to the SBI. The contact group on national communications from Annex I Parties, chaired by Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania) and Alexander Metalnikov (Russian Federation), met over the weekend and formulated a draft decision.", 
    "It proposed that the third national communications from Annex I Parties be due in 2001 and that subsequent national communications be due every 3 to 5 years.", 
    "The decision included a statement on the need for further efforts by Parties to improve completeness, consistency and comparability of data and information, as well as participating, through the SBI, in evaluating and refining the review process.", 
    "It proposed that the Secretariat complete a feasibility study on the potential usefulness of data comparison and report on information contained in annual national inventory submissions."
