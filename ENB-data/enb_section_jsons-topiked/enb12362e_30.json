    "THAT IS THE QUESTION Since beginning in Montreal in 2005, negotiations on long-term cooperation on climate change have been procedurally complex, consisting of several tracks.", 
    "Rather than simplifying matters, the Bali roadmap retained much of this complexity.", 
    "The roadmap includes the Bali Action Plan, which formally launched comprehensive negotiations on mitigation, adaptation, technology and finance under the UNFCCC, while the parallel track to define further commitments for industrialized countries under the Kyoto Protocol continues.", 
    "To ensure adequate progress under the Convention, the AWGLCA s work programme was the most important issue to be discussed in Bangkok.", 
    "While there were some proposals to prioritize the five elements in the Bali Action Plan, it did not take long for everyone to agree that the four building blocks (mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology) and a shared vision for long-term cooperative action would be addressed at every session in bite-sized chunks, allowing for effective negotiations.", 
    "Most delegations had chosen the strategy of proposing workshops on issues they wanted to see covered in the future agreement but knew to be contentious.", 
    "Given widely diverging views on mitigation action by developing countries, including on the concept of measuring, reporting and verifying (MRV) in the Bali Action Plan, it was hardly surprising that the workshops advocated by countries on related issues, such as sectoral approaches and MRV, proved to be the most contentious ones.", 
    "Those delegations urging the US to take on emission reduction targets also hoped to see in the work programme the issue of ensuring the comparability of efforts, which is mentioned in the Bali Action Plan in the context of mitigation by developed countries.", 
    "Given the debates in the informal plenary and the deep divisions on issues that seemed to persist, some wondered how much detail the work programme would include.", 
    "However, at the end of the meeting, a number of workshop proposals had been agreed to, which are intended to facilitate the AWGLCA process and to deepen understanding and clarify elements of the Bali Action Plan.", 
    "A multitude of workshops were proposed throughout the week, and, although not everyone got their proposed workshop included in the 2008 work programme, AWGLCA Chair Machado reassured those delegates whose proposals were not included that all elements of the Bali Action Plan would still be addressed at every session.", 
    "In the end, many said it was an acceptable starting point because it provides a timetable for the 2008 sessions, identifies issues needing further clarification, and, while not all contentious issues will be addressed in workshops, it ensures that all the elements of the Bali Action Plan will be discussed.", 
    "As one delegate put it on the final day after hours of negotiating the timing and content of workshops, We have to hope the end justifies the frustrations.", 
    "Another important procedural question concerned links and cooperation between the two negotiating tracks.", 
    "The G-77/China and the US, which have not taken on emission commitments under the Protocol, were opposed to any links between the two processes.", 
    "However, most developed countries are looking for much broader participation in mitigation efforts in the post-2012 period and have rather different ideas regarding linkages.", 
    "While no formal link was made or extensively discussed in Bangkok, clearly the two processes are already linked in the minds of many.", 
    "One delegate predicted that everyone in Annex B would at least wait to see what happens in the AWGLCA before accepting further commitments under the Protocol.", 
    "Some expressed concern that some might even jump ship to the new regime under the Convention if it proves to be more attractive to their interests.", 
    "With the chance of the US joining the Kyoto Protocol next to nil - unless the whole Kyoto framework is completely revamped - many are focusing attention on negotiations in the AWGLCA and how much the developed and developing countries are willing to take on in that process."
