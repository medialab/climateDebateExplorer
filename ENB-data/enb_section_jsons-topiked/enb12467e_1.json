    "During the AWG-LCA contact group in the morning, parties focused on adaptation, based on questions by the AWG-LCA Chair ( http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/ad_hoc_working_groups/lca/application/pdf/questions_for_adaptation_session-final.pdf ).", 
    "Discussions focused, inter alia , on scope of enhanced action on adaptation; institutional arrangements; addressing loss and damage; and how to match adaptation actions with support.",

AOSIS underscored special focus on SIDS and LDCs, stressed that the current institutional arrangements are lacking and fragmented, and called for, inter alia , an adaptation body under the Convention and a new funding window.", 
    "On loss and damage, she urged cost-effective risk transfer and sharing mechanisms, including access to insurance for extreme events and risk reduction measures.",

NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY and CANADA stressed that adaptation does not include adaptation to the impacts of response measures.", 
    "NEW ZEALAND opposed the establishment of an international mechanism to address loss and damage under the UNFCCC, highlighting difficulties with proving the link between climate change and any specific extreme event.", 
    "On matching action with support, she suggested enhancing the AF so that it becomes the adaptation fund under both the Convention and the Protocol.", 
    "Recognizing the importance of the issue for AOSIS, NORWAY said the proposal to address loss and damage raises many questions but that his country is open to discussing them.", 
    "He emphasized the approach in Copenhagen of addressing adaptation in tandem with finance. NICARAGUA stressed the need for developed countries to cover the full cost of adaptation actions.", 
    "He said planning and execution of adaptation policies and measures should be defined on a sovereign basis and identified the need for an adaptation fund under the Convention.

    "He stressed the need for adaptation by economically vulnerable countries and supported a new financial window to adapt to both the impacts of climate change and impacts of response measures.", 
    "He highlighted that loss and damage from the impacts of response measures should also be compensated.",

SWITZERLAND emphasized prioritizing support for the most vulnerable and the importance of matching adaptation needs with support, given the diverse sources of funding and needs.",
