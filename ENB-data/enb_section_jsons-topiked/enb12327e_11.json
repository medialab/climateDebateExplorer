    "The workshop on the Russian proposal was the subject of discussion in the corridors on Friday, with one delegate declaring, They have brought every controversial issue out into the open!", 
    "While many were questioning the wisdom of raising sensitive issues such as developing country commitments at this stage in the process, a few seemed more sanguine: At least we're clear on what the Russian proposal is all about, and we all know what these -\u0098unspoken' issues are anyway, whatever our views on them might be, reflected one.", 
    "I don't think that holding this now will make much difference to the long-term process one way or another, claimed one developing country delegate.", 
    "Meanwhile, some delegates were noting that the afternoon mitigation workshop was not so well attended.", 
    "Some of the presentations were interesting, but it felt a bit empty in the main plenary hall, commented one observer.", 
    "On the margins of the plenary halls, talks continued in contact groups and informal consultations, with some negotiators expressing satisfaction at progress made in many groups.", 
    "This was not the case in every group, though, with one lead negotiator walking out of the technology transfer informals at one stage after discussions on the functions of the proposed constituted body became bogged down."
