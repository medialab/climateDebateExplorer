    "Many rivers to cross But I can't seem to find my way over - \u00a6 Jimmy Cliff UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres opened the sixth part of the second session of the ADP emphasizing the need to seize the momentum built by the UN Climate Summit in September, and calling on delegates to 'build bridges and find a path forward you can all tread together'.", 
    "Yet as the meeting proceeded, some delegations quickly fell back into old habits, repeating oft-heard statements.", 
    "This left many to wonder whether the 'rivers' dividing parties might be too broad to cross before COP 20 in Lima.", 
    "This brief analysis will assess progress made in Bonn, overall group dynamics, and whether the exchanges of views that took place over the six days will enable construction of the bridges necessary for progress in Lima."
