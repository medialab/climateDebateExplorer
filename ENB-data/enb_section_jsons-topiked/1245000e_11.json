    "AG13's discussions on a future multilateral consultative process (MCP), while at an early stage, produced what was characterized as its own Framework Compilation from past proposals and, based on discussions, could likely encounter problems similar to the AGBM.", 
    "While not exactly a microcosm, there is some solid agreement as well as divergent perspectives as AG13 is heading toward a negotiating process.", 
    "Chair Patrick Sz\u00e9ll opened AG13-4 stating that the group cannot continue on a 'diet of general statements' and, by the end of the session, noted that the group has achieved more than expected.", 
    "Unlike the AGBM, delegates displayed a stronger willingness to compromise and incorporate proposals.", 
    "This was particularly obvious when China and the EU tried to incorporate their proposals into the text.", 
    "Like the AGBM, however, AG13's efforts to clarify the form of a future MCP leave many details unclear, particularly in defining its field of expertise and in squaring its work with that of the SBI and SBSTA.", 
    "Similarly, AG13-4 indicated that some differences will need to be resolved regarding the fundamental question of whether an MCP should have an advisory or a supervisory role."
