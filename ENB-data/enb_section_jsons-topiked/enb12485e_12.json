    "This issue was taken up in drafting and spinoff group discussions facilitated by Richard Muyungi (Tanzania).", 
    "The focus was on issues that could be agreed on in Cancun, and parties primarily considered how to structure discussions in order to produce a decision or part of a decision in Cancun.", 
    "Parties identified various issues that should be discussed in addition to those suggested by the AWG-LCA Chair in her pre-meeting scenario note, such as: compliance systems, including for non-Kyoto Protocol Annex I countries; comparability of actions by developed countries; the legal nature of the outcome; graduation of countries into Annex I; the nature and content of the set of decisions to be considered for adoption at Cancun, and the implications for the Kyoto Protocol and the goal of a legally-binding outcome under the AWG-LCA; and the framework for mitigation commitments by Annex I countries.", 
    "Parties also highlighted various elements that must be reflected in a Cancun outcome, including: continuation of the Kyoto Protocol; comparability of efforts; compliance; and intention to work towards a legally-binding agreement.", 
    "Many parties supported the idea of capturing developed countries pledges in a decision in Cancun, provided there is reference to this being without prejudice to the legal form.", 
    "Some said such a decision should also include reference to the fact that the current pledges are insufficient.", 
    "Regarding what should be inscribed, some parties said this should be limited to Annex I countries not party to the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "Others said it should include all Annex I countries, while others preferred inscribing the pledges of all countries, both Annex I and non-Annex I.", 
    "A note prepared by the facilitator containing reflections on the issues discussed at the meetings was presented to parties.", 
    "During the AWG-LCA closing plenary, several parties objected to the title and the note will now refer to the facilitator s understanding of issues discussed.", 
    "The will be forwarded to the AWG-LCA."
