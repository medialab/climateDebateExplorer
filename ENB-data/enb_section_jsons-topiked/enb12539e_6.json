    "The corridors were once again buzzing with speculations and murmurs of anticipation about the Chairs of the ADP and other outstanding nominations.", 
    "After enthusiastic opening statements under the ADP in the morning, work under the new body in the afternoon was confined to a brief announcement that consultations on its Chairs remain inconclusive.", 
    "By the end of the day, parties had not made significant progress on the selection of the Chairs and rumors circulated on the reasons for the deadlock and the possible ways forward.", 
    "Some speculated that one of the candidates was only willing to accept the position of Chair and not Vice-Chair, while others mentioned that the idea of having two Co-Chairs had also been raised.", 
    "To be honest it s unlikely that a decision will be made in Bonn, predicted one delegate, who expressed disappointment at the delay.", 
    "Those eager to start working stressed that the selection process does not necessarily need to delay negotiations as substantive work could be launched regardless.", 
    "One delegate even suggested that the COP President provisionally chair the body until a decision has been reached.", 
    "Others, however, felt that at least one Chair must be appointed before work of the ADP begins.", 
    "On the Green Climate Fund Board, things were apparently not looking so green as the announcement was made that the Board s first meeting, scheduled for the end of May, was postponed pending the process of nominations.", 
    "According to one delegate, although most groups have nominated their proposed Board members, others have chosen to go way beyond the call of duty and nominate more than their share of the composition.", 
    "There will be trouble, but I guess we will just have to see until all have submitted nominations, said one high-level delegate.", 
    "As the AWG-LCA contact group closed its meeting late in the evening, the fate of the leadership of the ADP hung in the air, like the GHG emissions that continue to fuel the climate process."
