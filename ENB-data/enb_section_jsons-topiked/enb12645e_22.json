    "WGIII Co-Chair Ram\u00f3n Pichs-Madruga (Cuba) reported on this Expert Meeting (IPCC-XLII/INF.15) held in Laxenburg, Austria, in May 2015, which resulted in recommendations for both the IPCC and for the scenario research community.", 
    "He highlighted the recommendation to the IPCC that scenarios should play a key role in the AR6 cycle in order to improve the integration of knowledge across the three WGs, which could include the development of an IPCC SR on the integrative use of scenarios, joint WG chapters on scenario-related issues, or installation of an \u201cauthor scenario group\u201d coordinating the use of scenarios throughout the writing process.", 
    "Pichs-Madruga said the Expert Meeting had also concluded that the IPCC should increase participation of developing countries in scenario development and capacity-building activities, and pursue synergies with other organizations and assessment bodies interested in scenario analysis.", 
    "The US welcomed the results of the Expert Meeting and commented on the critical importance of improving the utilization of scenarios across the WGs.", 
    "The Panel took note of the report."
