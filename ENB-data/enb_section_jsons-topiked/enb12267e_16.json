    "Memories of COP 9 and COP 10 plenary exchanges on the LDC Fund returned to the corridors Tuesday as delegates began to suspect that they were about to relive the inconclusive negotiations, in the style of the 'Groundhog Day' Hollywood film about someone fated to repeat the same day again and again.", 
    "Since COP 8\u0092s decision that further guidance for the operation of the LDC Fund would have to be developed for the GEF, negotiators from both sides seem to feel they have been starting over at each day of each session.", 
    "Some attributed the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to a rushed decision at COP 9, and handing over the initiative to the GEF Council at the expense of LDC delegates. Likewise, there were signs the budget negotiations could also take a repetitive turn."
