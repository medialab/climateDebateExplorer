    "During the discussions on Friday evening, India, Saudi Arabia, China and others suggested referring to technology transfer and financing in a paragraph on incentives and barriers to mitigation.", 
    "The Authors, supported by Canada, Austria and others, explained that although relevant, these issues did not fit under the heading robust findings.", 
    "Delegates agreed not to include them.", 
    "The rest of the text was adopted with minor changes.", 
    "Final Longer Report Text: The final text defines robust findings and key uncertainties.", 
    "It highlights that some findings may be policy-relevant even though they are associated with large uncertainties.", 
    "The text then lists robust findings on observed changes in climate and their effects and causes, including that: warming of the climate system is unequivocal; many natural systems on all continents and some oceans are being affected by regional climate changes; global greenhouse gas emissions have grown by 70% between 1970 and 2004; atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations far exceed pre-industrial values; and most of the warming over the past 50 years is very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas increases.", 
    "On key uncertainties, the text mentions that: data on some regions is limited and there is notable lack of geographical balance; analyzing extreme events is more difficult than climatic averages; effects of climate change on human and some natural systems are difficult to detect; difficulties remain in attributing observed temperature changes at smaller than continental scales; and magnitude of CO 2 emissions from land-use change remains uncertain.", 
    "On drivers and projections of future climate change and their impacts, robust findings include that: global emissions will continue to grow with current policies; a warming of 0.2 \u00b0C is projected for the next two decades; continued emissions at or above current levels would cause further warming and very likely induce larger changes than in the 20th century; warming tends to reduce uptake of CO 2 by terrestrial ecosystems and oceans; anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for centuries even if greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized; some systems, sectors and regions are likely to be especially affected by climate change; and impacts are very likely to increase due to extreme weather events.", 
    "As key uncertainties, the text lists: uncertainty in equilibrium climate sensitivity creates uncertainty in the expected warming for a given stabilization scenario; considerably different modeling results on feedbacks; aerosol impacts; future changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet mass affecting sea level rise; large-scale ocean circulation changes beyond the 21st century; uncertainties surrounding regional projections hampering impacts research; and understanding of low-probability/high-impact events and cumulative impacts is generally limited.", 
    "On responses to climate change, the robust findings include: some planned adaptation is occurring and more extensive adaptation is required; unmitigated climate change would be likely to exceed adaptive capacity in the long term; a wide range of mitigation opportunities are available at costs ranging from net negative up to US$100/tCO 2 eq; to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations, emissions would need to peak and decline; the lower the stabilization level, the lower the risks; a range of stabilization levels can be achieved by using currently available technologies and those expected to be commercialized in coming decades; this requires appropriate and effective incentives and further research, development and dissemination; sustainable development paths can make major contributions to mitigation and adaptation; and seemingly unrelated macroeconomic and other policies can significantly affect emissions.", 
    "The key uncertainties include: understanding of how development planners incorporate information on climate variability and change in their decisions is limited; adaptive and mitigative capacity depends on socioeconomic development pathways; barriers, limits and costs of adaptation are not fully understood; estimates of mitigation potential and costs depend on various assumptions and uncertainty arises in particular concerning technology-related issues and effects of changes in behavior and lifestyles; and effects of non-climate policies on emissions are poorly quantified."
