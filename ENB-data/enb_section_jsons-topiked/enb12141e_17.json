    "In the ensuing question-and- answer session, a number of participants asked Adele Morris for additional information on the US position.", 
    "On thresholds, Morris said an option for the phase-in proposal during the first commitment period was to adjust assigned amounts by including only net removals over a set threshold.", 
    "She suggested that this threshold could vary by Party to fit their specific circumstances.", 
    "In response to questions from Japan and France on the idea of discount rates, Morris said this related to the phase-in proposal and would involve straightforward percentage discounts for particular accounts - for instance, forest management accounts - before adjusting assigned amounts.", 
    "AOSIS expressed concern over the degree to which the US position differed from the business-as-usual scenario. In response to a query relating to WWF's position on sinks and the CDM, Stephan Singer said a key concern was that domestic action should not be undermined as the primary tool in meeting Protocol commitments."
