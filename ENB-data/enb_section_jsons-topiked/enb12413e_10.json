    "In the morning contact group, Co-Chair Leon Charles (Grenada) suggested discussing the aggregate range of Annex I emission reductions.", 
    "The EU said that the proposed 30% aggregate reduction by 2020 is based on modeling showing a 50% probability of limiting global temperature to below 2\u00b0C, explaining that although there would be an overshoot beyond 500ppm, later in the century concentrations would come down to 450ppm.", 
    "He also said: the economic scenario shows this would be affordable; developed countries should make comparable efforts; and developing countries would contribute according to their respective capabilities and responsibilities.", 
    "Responding to questions, the EU explained that the target assumes the continuation of the CDM, but does not consider LULUCF, as the rules are still uncertain.", 
    "He also said the 30% target does not include developing countries.", 
    "NEW ZEALAND noted that the target is for a reduction by 2020, and that most proposals for the second commitment period are for 2013-2017, and asked how the target would be approximated for the second commitment period.", 
    "The EU responded that a linear reduction would be applied to calculate the number for 2017.", 
    "Informal consultations in the afternoon took a question and answer format, with countries that had made proposals for Annex I aggregate emissions targets fielding questions from other parties about the assumptions, principles and considerations that informed these proposed targets.", 
    "Parties raised questions about, inter alia , scientific underpinnings, equity, LULUCF rules, mechanisms, bunker fuels, costs of compliance, distribution of capacity, and repercussions for developing countries. OTHER ISSUES (AWG-KP): The spin-off group met informally to consider LULUCF, with parties discussing how the group would conduct its work.", 
    "They agreed that the co-chairs would prepare a new document for Thursday s discussions, including both the proposals in the Chair s text ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/8 ) and other concrete legal text proposals submitted by parties.", 
    "Discussions on the definition of wetlands followed, identifying the need to consider: potential symmetric language for sources and sinks; whether to define wetlands broadly or focus on peatlands; and methodological issues related to identifying anthropogenic signals. POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES (AWG-KP): In the contact group, Co-Chair Paul Watkinson (France) recommended proceeding on the basis of the text in Annex VI (FCCC/AWG/2009/5), restructured into eight clusters: issues building on past work and the issue of coherence; scope of consequences and complexity of addressing them; relevant articles in the Protocol; guidelines; most vulnerable states; factors to consider; understanding the consequences; and cooperation on technology.", 
    "After discussion, parties agreed to the proposal.", 
    "South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, recommended ensuring that the eight clusters follow a logical pattern: deepening of understanding; guidelines and best practice; design and selection issues; and implementation.", 
    "The co-chairs will prepare the new text by Friday.", 
    "Parties also discussed whether to work towards a COP/MOP decision or AWG-KP conclusions.", 
    "The EU, NEW ZEALAND, JAPAN, and AUSTRALIA stated a preference to focus on substance before determining the nature of the outcome. BUDGET (SBI): In the contact group, the Secretariat explained the proposed budget for the biennium 2010-2011 ( FCCC/SBI/2009/2 and Adds.", 
    "1 and 3 ).", 
    "On areas in need of strengthening, he mentioned: reporting and review of the information submitted by Convention parties; facilitating the mobilization of financial resources particularly for developing countries; fostering the role of the carbon market; legal advice; and conference services and information.", 
    "He also outlined areas where savings were envisaged. AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND prioritized reporting and review.", 
    "Nigeria, for the G-77/CHINA, noted that additional activities based on decisions and outcomes from Copenhagen justified the modest budget increase.", 
    "MEXICO reiterated constraints, which would make it difficult to meet contributions, and requested the Secretariat to explore areas where further savings could be made.", 
    "In the afternoon, separate discussions took place on the International Transaction Log (ITL), facilitated by Douglas Forsythe (Canada) and the Secretariat gave an overview of multiple measures applied to optimize the proposed 2010-2011 ITL budget and challenges. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (SBI/SBSTA): In the contact group, discussions centered on how to structure the contact group s work.", 
    "Co-Chair Holger Liptow (Germany) explained that there were eight documents to consider and proposed that the group take note of the reports and refer them to the AWG-LCA, rather than considering them in-depth.", 
    "Some parties expressed preference for discussing some of the documents.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA proposed requesting the AWG-LCA to take up and consider the recommendations contained in the documents.", 
    "The Co-Chairs will prepare draft conclusions. REDD (SBSTA): In the contact group, many parties noted that conservation, sustainable forest management and enhancement of forest stocks require further discussion of methodologies.", 
    "PANAMA drew attention to the technical paper on the cost of implementation ( FCCC/TP/2009/1 ), noting that more than half of developing countries do not yet have complete national GHG inventories, that financial support is needed to complete this work, and that historical data is lacking in many countries.", 
    "BRAZIL indicated that methodological issues differ for gross or net accounting.", 
    "Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, called for a COP agenda item on REDD to ensure parallel discussions under the different bodies.", 
    "The US suggested that decision might be reached on: estimation and monitoring; use of IPCC guidelines; and the need for robust and transparent monitoring systems with independent review.", 
    "AUSTRALIA suggested that agreement exists on the need for a phased approach, and that different countries have different capacities and circumstances.", 
    "Co-Chair Rosland proposed that discussions on Thursday focus on monitoring. CAPACITY BUILDING UNDER THE CONVENTION (SBI): Co-Chair Helmut Hojesky (Austria) said the contact group should finalize the outcome of the review of the capacity building framework at this meeting, and prepare a draft COP decision.", 
    "He said the group should take stock of progress thus far on the review and identify capacity building gaps and lessons learned.", 
    "He stressed the need to pay attention to related AWG-LCA discussions to avoid duplication.", 
    "The Secretariat reviewed highlights from the synthesis report of experiences and lessons learned in the use of performance indicators for monitoring and evaluating capacity building ( FCCC/SBI/2009/5 ).", 
    "Regarding the synthesis report, the US requested clarity on who the survey was sent to, and said she was impressed by the number of developing country responses to the survey.", 
    "She said bilateral efforts and South-South cooperation should have been expanded upon.", 
    "Tanzania, for the G-77/CHINA, said developing countries capacity building needs have not been met, and asked how to measure success and failure.", 
    "He underscored more capacity development needs would be identified and put forward in light of the new regime, such as for the proposed NAMA registry.", 
    "The EU urged better donor coordination, work among UN agencies, and more stakeholder and local actor involvement in capacity building.", 
    "AUSTRALIA said monitoring and evaluation and development of performance indicators must be nationally driven. CAPACITY BUILDING UNDER THE PROTOCOL (SBI): Co-Chair Hojesky asked delegates to review priority areas for capacity building related to participation in CDM projects as elaborated in decision 29/CMP.1 for discussion at the next informal meeting. PRIVILIGES AND IMMUNITIES (SBI): Chair Tamara Curll (Australia) recalled the mandate to consider appropriate arrangements relating to privileges and immunities for individuals serving on constituted bodies under the Protocol.", 
    "She suggested the contact group focus on forwarding draft treaty arrangements to COP/MOP 5, noting that text relating to treaty arrangements as part of the post-2012 outcome would need to be communicated to parties by 17 June 2009.", 
    "A legal officer from UN headquarters highlighted Article VI of the 1946 UN Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, and proposed that delegates mirror the language in Article VI in a new treaty arrangement or amendment to the Protocol.", 
    "The EU and AUSTRALIA said treaty arrangements should be part of the post-2012 package.", 
    "TUVALU favored the adoption of a stand-alone agreement, explaining that the outcome in Copenhagen is still unclear.", 
    "CHINA cautioned against prejudging the Copenhagen outcome and favored an amendment to the Protocol.", 
    "The EU proposed that the group concentrate on substance and consider issues relating to form at a later stage.", 
    "Chair Curll proposed, and delegates agreed to further discuss which constituted bodies should be conferred privileges and immunities, as well as to consider the nature of immunities and waiver provisions."
