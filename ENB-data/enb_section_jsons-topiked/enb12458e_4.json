COP President s Special Representative Hedegaard suggested the contact group reconvene later in the evening to receive an update on progress in drafting groups. NORWAY and ARGENTINA inquired about addressing emissions from bunker fuels and COP President s Special Representative Hedegaard explained that text would be available in the afternoon.",

    "On technology, Co-Facilitator Kumarsingh reported that parties have agreed on the establishment of a technology mechanism with a technology executive committee and a climate executive center.", 
    "He said discussions had focused on the functions of these entities and agreement had been reached with some minor issues outstanding.",

    "Reporting on financial institutional arrangements, Co-Facilitator Uosukainen said that the drafting group had addressed the issue of a climate fund or facility, and noted movement on the selection of a trustee to the fund or facility on an interim basis.", 
    "He said that divergent views remained on the composition and nomination of a finance board and its corresponding functions, explaining that these issues could benefit from political resolution.", 
    "Facilitator Uosukainen also noted that the group lacked time to address the remaining paragraphs on the establishment and functions of the proposed finance board.", 
    "On capacity building, Facilitator B\u00f8rsting identified difficult outstanding issues requiring political guidance.",

    "On REDD-plus, Facilitator Graham highlighted outstanding issues relating to financing, relationship to NAMAs and MRV of action and support.", 
    "On various approaches to enhancing cost-effectiveness of mitigation actions, including markets, Facilitator Figueres Olsen highlighted two outstanding issues: whether to adopt an option encouraging parties to pursue HFC regulation under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer; and the role of markets and how this role should be structured.",

    "SUDAN suggested continuation of discussions in drafting groups.", 
    "The US, opposed by BRAZIL, noted the possibility of convening a friends of the chair group while continuing with drafting. SOUTH AFRICA, supported by Grenada, for AOSIS, suggested forwarding issues related to mitigation by developed countries, market approach and finance to the political level.",

    "MEXICO supported working in a friends of the chair format, provided the group discusses only political issues.", 
    "NEW ZEALAND stressed the need to continue working through a smaller group with higher-level representation.", 
    "Following brief consultations, COP President s Special Representative Hedegaard recommended that the majority of drafting groups continue with their work, especially those that had reported it would be meaningful to do so.", 
    "She also proposed convening the friends of the chair to address political issues on mitigation by developed countries, market approaches and finance.",

    "Emphasizing the late hour, COP President s Special Representative Hedegaard closed the meeting and sent the drafting groups on all issues back to work, saying that stock of progress would be taken later in the night. JOINT IMPLEMENTATION (COP/MOP): During the contact group on joint implementation (JI), Co-Chair Lesolle introduced a revised draft COP/MOP decision, noting that the only outstanding issue is that relating to extending the share of proceeds to JI. SIERRA LEONE noted the new text does not adequately reflect previous discussions, especially regarding the option to take no decision on the issue, and also regarding reference to double counting.", 
    "He also proposed specifying that the share of proceeds will be paid into the Adaptation Fund.", 
    "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION, supported by UKRAINE, proposed a new option, which states that the share of proceeds would be paid into the Adaptation Fund on a voluntary basis.", 
    "NEW ZEALAND said the option of taking no decision on the issue is misleading and proposed amending the option to state that no decision would be taken on the issue within this contact group, noting that this issue was being discussed elsewhere and a decision could be taken there.", 
    "UKRAINE said they would be willing to drop the third option on payment on a voluntary basis, if the first option regarding no decision to be taken is kept in its original form without the new insertions regarding decisions being possibly taken elsewhere.", 
    "The Co-Chairs will consult informally and produce new text for Friday."
