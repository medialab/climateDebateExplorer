    "The Co-Chair suggested inserting 'keeping in mind comments by delegations' in paragraph 2, which recalls the INC mandate to prepare for COP-1.", 
    "The G-77 said the phrase was inadequate because the draft referred to document A/AC.237/87 without mentioning the proposed G-77 amendments, and suggested inserting 'as amended' after the reference.", 
    "However, the EU, the US and the UK did not want to accord 'amendment' status to the G-77 proposals since there had been no substantive debate.", 
    "The Group adopted the draft and agreed to note the delegations\u0092 comments."
