AUSTRALIA suggested that if there was no agreement to annex a text, then parties could consider a workshop at COP 19 on areas of convergence, namely adaptation and co-benefits.", 
    "Egypt, for the G-77/CHINA, proposed text to be inserted in the draft conclusions which called for an in-session workshop in Warsaw and for submissions on adaptation and additional co-benefits, to consider, inter alia , current state of scientific knowledge on agriculture and climate change, sustainable development, food security and diversity of agricultural systems.",
