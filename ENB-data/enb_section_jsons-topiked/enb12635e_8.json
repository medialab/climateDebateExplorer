    "On Monday, with many new delegates arriving at the World Conference Center Bonn for the final days of negotiations, there was widespread convergence on the need to start negotiating the text for the new agreement. During the morning\u2019s ADP stocktaking exercise, a sense of urgency seemed to be growing with many parties searching for ways to pick up the pace.", 
    "Some parties called for the ADP Co-Chairs to craft a consolidated text and others urged raising the number of negotiating days before Paris.", 
    "Some called it \u201chealthy\u201d for delegates to recognize the limitations of a purely party-driven approach, and turn the text to the Co-Chairs for further streamlining. Another reality check came in the afternoon\u2019s facilitated discussions, where, as one observer remarked, \u201clittle seems to have changed.\u201d Though many appreciated the new \u201ctool\u201d provided by the co-facilitators in the time frame group and parties keeping discussions \u201cat the right level,\u201d in other groups one lamented the reappearance of entrenched positions, as soon as matters of substance appeared on the surface."
