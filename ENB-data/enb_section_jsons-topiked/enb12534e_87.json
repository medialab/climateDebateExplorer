    "In Section I of the decision (FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/L.4), the COP agrees: to continue to work towards identifying a global goal for substantially reducing global emissions by 2050 to be considered at COP 18; to continue to work towards identifying a timeframe for the global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions based on the best available scientific knowledge and equitable access to sustainable development, and consider it at COP 18; and that consideration of a global goal cannot be undertaken in the abstract and will necessarily involve matters related to the context.", 
    "The COP also requests the AWG-LCA to consider the issue of equitable access to sustainable development, as contained in Decision 1/CP.16, through a workshop at its next session and to report on it to the COP."
