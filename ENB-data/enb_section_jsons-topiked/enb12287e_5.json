    "Parties agreed to a draft COP/MOP decision and draft SBSTA conclusions presented by Chair Georg B\u00f8rsting (Norway) on the implications of the establishment of new HCFC-22 facilities seeking to obtain CERs for the destruction of HFC-23.", 
    "The draft decision includes a definition of new HCFC-22 facilities, recognizes that issuing CERs for HFC-23 destruction could lead to higher global production of HCFC-22 and/or HFC-23, and encourages Annex I Parties and multilateral financial institutions to provide funding for destruction of HFC-23 in non-Annex I Parties.", 
    "The decision also requests SBSTA to continue deliberations on the issue with a view to preparing a draft recommendation with guidance to the CDM Executive Board for adoption at COP/MOP 2."
