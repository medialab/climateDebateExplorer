    "In the war to save the world from climate change, SB-20 turned out to be just a minor skirmish, with only sporadic shots fired.", 
    "But although it was generally a quiet event that saw little serious conflict, the meeting was not totally without incident.", 
    "In particular, several new innovations and some increased technical complexities emerged in the process.", 
    "This analysis reviews the state of play in the climate negotiations, focusing on those new complexities and innovations that came to the fore at SB-20, and on hopes for COP-10 and beyond."
