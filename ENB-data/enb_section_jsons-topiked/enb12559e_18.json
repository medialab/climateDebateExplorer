    "Over the course of the day on Wednesday, it became very clear that the AWG-KP issues of the length of the second commitment period and the carry-over of AAUs would need to be handed over to ministers when they arrive for, as one delegate put it, a high-level touch.", 
    "All we can do now is to streamline options until then.", 
    "I really feel we re just marking time, commented another, pointing out that so far, all they have been doing is clarifying already crystal clear positions.", 
    "On the AWG-LCA side, a negotiator opined that considering the optimism expressed during the pre-COP in Seoul, he had come to Doha expecting that a sense of urgency would guide the AWG-LCA.", 
    "He lamented that, unfortunately, this optimism seemed to have dissipated and things were now at a near standstill, with many rejecting the Chair s text as the basis for further negotiations.", 
    "One delegate said she really hoped that parties would wake up and realize that this back and forth will get us nowhere.", 
    "We need to work together.", 
    "She recalled the now popular phrase uttered by COP 17 President Nkoana Mashabane: If you want to walk fast, walk alone; if you want to walk far, walk with others.", 
    "She said all parties need to take a slow, perhaps, but at least steady road to 2015, and hopefully get something good out of the long walk."
