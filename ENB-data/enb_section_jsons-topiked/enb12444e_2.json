    "Informal consultations took place on mitigation by developed countries.", 
    "In the morning, parties considered several suggested areas of focus, such as how to define the collective goal for developed countries, the nature of individual emission reductions, comparability of efforts, application of the Kyoto Protocol s provisions mutatis mutandis and the nature of a MRV system.", 
    "Many parties supported focusing on these areas in further discussions, noting that they address some of the key concerns.", 
    "Several parties, however, expressed concern with some of the issues included on the list and identified issues they felt should be addressed in other mitigation sub-groups.", 
    "Developing countries underlined that the focus of discussions should be on Protocol non-parties and that comparability of efforts should be ensured."
