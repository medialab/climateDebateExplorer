    "Two sides of the UNFCCC, two 'faces,' were clearly visible at COP-9.", 
    "The first face was that of the ongoing negotiations aimed at strengthening and building on the original treaty and bringing the Kyoto Protocol to fruition.", 
    "While these official negotiations enjoyed some progress at COP-9, including an agreement on the use of sinks in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), this side of the meeting could hardly be seen as an overwhelming success.", 
    "While the official intergovernmental negotiations seemed beset by inertia and a lack of leadership, the COP-9 corridors were buzzing with what some saw as the second 'face' of the meeting; the 'implementing face.", 
    "' This side of COP-9 was reflected in the workshops and other side events that showed the vision and enthusiasm being demonstrated for the Convention by its observer constituencies: environmental NGOs, business and industry groups, local governments, indigenous peoples organizations, and research and independent NGOs (RINGOs).", 
    "It is these constituencies who continue to prove that, regardless of some Parties\u0092 apparent reluctance to make significant progress, vigorous efforts to address the adverse effects of climate change are already underway, and are gaining momentum.", 
    "This analysis provides an insight into these two different 'faces' of the UNFCCC process."
