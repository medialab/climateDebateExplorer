    "Economies in transition (EITs): Delegates considered the framework for capacity building in EITs and a proposed draft decision on capacity building in EITs.", 
    "SLOVENIA introduced the draft decision that, inter alia, decides to establish a process and create a framework for capacity-building activities in EITs, urges Annex II Parties to ensure financial support required for the implementation of the capacity building process and further urges the GEF to develop an operational strategy to implement the elements of a framework process for capacity building.", 
    "Following comments and questions on the decision, Co-Chair Uosukainen requested Slovenia to consult informally to seek agreement on the text. Among the issues raised in discussing the draft framework were the need to elaborate one formulation regarding implementation of the FCCC and Protocol and to clarify how information will be provided to enable the COP to review progress in implementing the framework. Developing countries: On text outlining a framework relating to capacity building in developing countries, UGANDA, speaking for the LDCs, said the group's position had not been reflected in the text.", 
    "Participants agreed to continue informal consultations in a smaller group."
