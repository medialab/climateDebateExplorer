    "Climate change is considered to be one of the most serious threats to sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on the environment, human health, food security, economic activity, natural resources, and physical infrastructure.", 
    "Global climate varies naturally but scientists agree that rising concentrations of anthropogenically produced greenhouse gases in the Earth\u0092s atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate.", 
    "According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of climate change have already been observed, and scientific findings indicate that precautionary and prompt action is necessary. The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992.", 
    "The UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous anthropogenic interference' with the climate system.", 
    "Controlled gases include methane, nitrous oxide and, in particular, carbon dioxide.", 
    "The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now has 189 Parties."
