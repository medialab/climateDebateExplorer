    "Technology transfer is considered a key element in combating climate change under the UNFCCC.", 
    "Technology transfer activities have been on the agenda of every session of the SBSTA and the Conference of the Parties (COP).", 
    "UNFCCC Article 4.5, which addresses the need for technology transfer, states that 'developed country Parties\u0085shall take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention,' adding that 'in this process, the developed country Parties shall support the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing country Parties.", 
    "' At the seventh Conference of the Parties (COP-7) held in November 2001 in Marrakesh, Morocco, delegates decided to establish an Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) to support the work of the SBSTA in advancing the Convention\u0092s technology-related goals.", 
    "During 2002-2003, the EGTT met several times, adopting a work programme and providing input and advice to the SBSTA on technology transfer.", 
    "During that time, the EGTT considered a variety of issues, focusing in particular on information dissemination, enabling environments for the transfer of environmentally-sound technologies, and technology needs assessments.", 
    "In this regard, UNFCCC workshops were held on technology information (Beijing, China, April 2002), needs assessments (Seoul, Republic of Korea, April 2002), and enabling environments (Ghent, Belgium, April 2003). In December 2003, the nineteenth session of SBSTA approved the EGTT\u0092s programme of work for 2004.", 
    "The programme included a new request that the EGTT should begin to examine the matter of innovative financing for the development and transfer of technologies.", 
    "SBSTA-19 also asked the UNFCCC Secretariat to organize a workshop on the matter, and to report back on the findings of the workshop at SBSTA-21 in December 2004.", 
    "At its twentieth session in June 2004, SBSTA provided further guidance on how the workshop should be organized, recommending that it have a practical focus and that it consider case studies from various stakeholders using a range of technologies under varying situations and circumstances."
