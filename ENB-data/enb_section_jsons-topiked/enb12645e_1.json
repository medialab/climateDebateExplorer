    "The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess, on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis, the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding human-induced climate change, its potential impacts, and options for adaptation and mitigation.", 
    "The IPCC is an intergovernmental and scientific body with 195 country members.", 
    "It does not undertake new research, nor does it monitor climate-related data.", 
    "Instead, it conducts assessments of knowledge on the basis of published and peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature.", 
    "IPCC reports are intended to be policy relevant but not policy prescriptive.", 
    "The IPCC has three WGs: Working Group I (WGI) addresses the physical science basis of climate change; Working Group II (WGII) addresses climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and Working Group III (WGIII) addresses options for limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigating climate change.", 
    "Each WG has two Co-Chairs and six Vice-Chairs, except, for the fifth assessment cycle WGIII had three Co-Chairs.", 
    "The Co-Chairs guide the WGs in fulfilling the mandates given to them by the Panel and are assisted in this task by Technical Support Units (TSUs).", 
    "The IPCC also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI) to oversee the IPCC National GHG Inventories Programme, also supported by a TSU.", 
    "The Programme aims to develop and refine an internationally-agreed methodology and software for the calculation and reporting of national GHG emissions and removals, and encourage its use by parties to the UNFCCC.", 
    "The Panel elects its Bureau for the duration of a full assessment cycle, which lasts between five and seven years and includes the preparation of an IPCC assessment report.", 
    "The Bureau\u2019s role is to assist the IPCC Chair in planning, coordinating and monitoring the IPCC\u2019s work, and is composed of climate change experts representing all regions.", 
    "Currently, the Bureau comprises 34 members, having expanded from 31 as of the elections held at this session (IPCC-42) per a decision taken at IPCC-41, and includes the IPCC Chair and Vice-Chairs, the WG Co-Chairs and Vice-Chairs, and the TFI Co-Chairs and its members.", 
    "In 2011, the IPCC established an Executive Committee (ExComm) to assist with intersessional work and coordination among the WGs.", 
    "The ExComm consists of the IPCC Chair, IPCC Vice-Chairs, WG and TFI Co-Chairs, and advisory members, including the Head of the IPCC Secretariat and the four Heads of the TSUs.", 
    "The IPCC Secretariat is located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is hosted by the WMO."
