    "The contact group considered the framework for capacity building in EITs and in developing countries, and began consideration of a proposed draft decision on capacity building in EITs. Regarding EITs, issues discussed included: the need for capacity building to assist in achieving the overall objectives of the Convention and Protocol; whether consideration of progress on capacity building relating to the Protocol should be referred to the COP/MOP; and who should monitor progress.", 
    "CANADA stressed elaborating the concept of an enabling environment to ensure that it does not imply delays in initiating capacity building activities.", 
    "SLOVENIA introduced a proposal for a draft decision calling for a prompt start to capacity building in EITs, and a COP decision to initiate the creation of the framework for capacity building. Regarding a framework for non-Annex I country capacity building, participants sought clarity on, inter alia, how to monitor implementation, whether there should be coherence in the frameworks for EITs and developing countries, the role of national focal points, and how GEF could be involved in the implementation of the framework."
