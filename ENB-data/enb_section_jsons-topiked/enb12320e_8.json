    "The final text explains that the focus of Section B is on the relationship between observed climate change and recent observed changes in the natural and human environment.", 
    "It highlights new and improved data since the TAR, allowing a broader and more confident assessment.", 
    "The SPM states that many natural systems are affected by regional climate changes, based on observational evidence from all continents and most oceans.", 
    "The text provided statements and examples concerning changes in: snow, ice and frozen ground; hydrological systems; terrestrial biological systems; marine and freshwater biological systems; and ocean acidification.", 
    "Section B also states, on the basis of global data since 1970, that anthropogenic warming has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems.", 
    "It explains evidence underlying this finding, and identifies limitations and gaps preventing more complete assessment.", 
    "The text also indicates that other effects of regional climate changes on natural and human environments are emerging but they are difficult to discern due to adaptation and non-climatic drivers.", 
    "It provides some detailed examples of such effects."
