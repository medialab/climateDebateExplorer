    "On Wednesday morning, AWG-LCA Chair Reifsnyder presented a revised amalgamation document (FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/CRP.38) to the plenary, together with a note on areas for further consideration in ministerial-led consultations.", 
    "These areas include: within shared vision, global goal and timeframe for global peaking; within developed country mitigation, pledges, accounting, ambition and compliance; within developing country mitigation, the level of ambition; within cooperative sectoral approaches, a possible work programme on agriculture and general framework; within the Adaptation Committee, its composition and reporting line; and outstanding Review issues, including the scope and the body to conduct the Review.", 
    "On CRP.38, Reifsnyder suggested that ministerial input may be required to take forward discussions on a shared vision after little progress in the contact group.", 
    "He explained that on mitigation for developed countries, guidance from ministers is needed on the clarification of pledges and whether these may be accounted for in aggregate form.", 
    "He also suggested a work programme on common accounting rules, drawing from the ongoing work on clarifying the pledges.", 
    "On biennial reports he said remaining issues relate to whether guidelines on these reports may be adopted at this, or deferred to the next meeting, highlighting the informal group may resolve this issue.", 
    "On mitigation by developing countries, he said the amalgamation document addresses four areas: level of ambition; biennial update reports; ICA; and the Registry, noting more work is needed on all areas.",

    "On biennial update reports, he said guidelines could be adopted at this, or forwarded to the next, meeting.", 
    "He also said finance, technology transfer, REDD+ finance, response measures, as well as various approaches need continued work in informal groups, and that progress has been made on sectoral approaches, but ministers may need to finalize issues, including consideration of approaches to international aviation and shipping.", 
    "He also pointed out advances on the Adaptation Committee, and capacity-building, with a small number of outstanding issues to be decided by ministers.", 
    "On legal options, he said the issue will be taken up by the Indaba process.", 
    "Responding to delegations with concerns regarding the list of areas going forward for ministerial consideration, and lack of balance in the treatment of issues, Reifsnyder assured parties that ministerial-led consultations will be inclusive, the list of areas identified for ministers is indicative, there is a great deal of work to be done on mitigation, and that he has noted their concerns about response measures.

    "South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, explained that its option for accounting for forest management was introduced because of concern with the reference levels approach.", 
    "Based on the outcomes of the review process, he said that Annex I parties have pursued diverse approaches, which allows them to pick and choose their own models, factors and data. BOLIVIA underscored the need to increase the level of ambition through clear political will.", 
    "The EU noted progress on all chapters and its offer clearly on the table for a second commitment period that is ratifiable.", 
    "Algeria, also for the AFRICAN GROUP, emphasized that enhanced political will from Annex I parties is the only thing that can break the deadlock facing the second commitment period.
