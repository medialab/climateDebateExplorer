    "On Thursday afternoon, 22 March, participants met in the closing Plenary.", 
    "CGE Chair Ajavon opened the meeting and requested each working group to present the recommendations it had identified during the course of the workshop.", 
    "The recommendations will be forwarded to the CGE for its consideration and review.", 
    "The recommendations will then be returned to the Parties for comments, and finally will be presented to the SBI for submission to the COP for its consideration. Each of the working groups then presented its recommendations: Chair Ajavon, on behalf of the group on greenhouse gas inventories; the rapporteur, Mahendra Kumar, for the working group on V&A assessment; Lauraine Lotter, rapporteur for the working group on greenhouse gas abatement issues; and Philip Weech, rapporteur for the group on cross-cutting issues. On cross-cutting issues, SENEGAL suggested including educational centers in the clearing-house mechanism.", 
    "Parties agreed with GERMANY that the workshop should take into account the input of the working group on support programmes and technical and financial needs and recommend further consideration and elaboration of these needs by the CGE members, who should also take into account input from other working groups, other regional workshops and the deliberations during the Plenary.", 
    "SENEGAL suggested avoiding adding tasks to the CGE and deleting text that is not agreed.", 
    "She stressed the need to know why many countries did not submit their initial national communications before recommending the need for financial support.", 
    "EL SALVADOR suggested specifying in the recommendation the types of actions that should be taken by support programmes.", 
    "Chair Ajavon responded that the corresponding subsidiary bodies of the UNFCCC would decide on the actions. Parties then discussed several issues on national circumstances.", 
    "EGYPT suggested reporting the information on national circumstances in a way that enables the coordination of technical assistance.", 
    "ETHIOPIA suggested adding reference to land use and land cover among national circumstances.", 
    "GERMANY said the description of national circumstances should be linked across other sections of the report, in particular to inventories. Parties asked whether the comments made by the participants were to be considered by the CGE in its preparation of the final document.", 
    "Participants also debated whether the recommendations could be adopted at the workshop without careful consideration and deliberation of each one, and discussed the role of the CGE in making further adjustments to the recommendations.", 
    "The Secretariat explained that the recommendations would be forwarded to the CGE, which would consider the comments made during the final Plenary, and return the revised recommendations to participants for comments before the document is forwarded to the SBI. With the understanding that the process had not yet been completed, the recommendations were then adopted by the Plenary.", 
    "Chair Ajavon read out the final statement of the workshop, which, on behalf of the experts: recognized the important contribution to the work of the CGE; thanked the Governments of Panama, Mexico, Kenya and Thailand for hosting the workshops; thanked the governments of the US, Germany, Australia, Switzerland and Finland for providing funds for the organization of the workshop and meetings of the CGE; appreciated the assistance and guidance provided by the members of the CGE and the UNFCCC Secretariat; and urged the CGE members to take the recommendations of the workshop into consideration in fulfilling the tasks of the CGE, in accordance with its mandates contained in decision 8/CP.5. Chair Ajavon thanked the participants and wished them safe journeys home.", 
    "Martha Perdomo (UNFCCC Secretariat) thanked the participants, support staff, interpreters, and the government of Panama for their support.", 
    "Emilio Sempris, on behalf of the Administrator of ANAM, underscored the importance of the meeting and expressed his gratitude to the participants.", 
    "He closed the meeting at 8:00 pm."
