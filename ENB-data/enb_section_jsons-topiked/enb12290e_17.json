    "Progress on Article 3.9 on Thursday night had some delegates smiling but 'vaguely confused.", 
    "' The agreement on a bracketed decision that sets out various options for how to proceed was being interpreted as 'highly unusual but still a positive outcome' by one insider.", 
    "Further high-level discussions were taking place late on Thursday night on the entire package of issues. While news from the small group negotiations was positive, some concerns were being expressed about the dwindling numbers in plenary.", 
    "Many ministers and high-level officials were left to address a largely empty hall, prompting several delegates to propose a more 'interactive' approach involving thematic roundtables and panel discussions.", 
    "However, no one disputed the overall usefulness of the high-level segment, which increases visibility and political commitment to the process, and allows for a multitude of bilateral meetings to take place. In other talk, many participants seemed excited at the imminent prospect of former US President Bill Clinton\u0092s visit on Friday."
