    "This contact group was chaired by Thelma Krug (Brazil).", 
    "Chair Krug proposed to base discussion on the draft text in the technical paper on simplified modalities and procedures.", 
    "BRAZIL, for the G-77/China, asked for time for regional consultations.", 
    "Parties addressed bundling, leakage, additionality, environmental and social impacts, definitions of low-income communities, and monitoring. On bundling, the EU and several Parties cautioned that larger projects could be 'debundled' into smaller projects to take advantage of simplified modalities.", 
    "BOLIVIA supported bundling and requested development of technical instruments to address this matter.", 
    "TUVALU requested bundled projects to be similar, to avoid baseline inconsistencies. On leakage, JAPAN, with CANADA and INDIA, opposed by TUVALU, BRAZIL and the EU, supported exempting leakage because of monitoring costs and the unlikelihood of major impact, given the small size of projects.", 
    "The EU suggested the option of an extra percentage of additional removals to account for leakage. On additionality, TUVALU and others stressed the importance of accounting for additionality, with BRAZIL recalling that projects imply emissions in Annex I Parties.", 
    "BOLIVIA, BURKINA FASO and CANADA suggested that the existing lack of incentives for sustainable forestry and land management among low-income communities in developing countries be sufficient proof of additionality. On environmental and social impacts, JAPAN stressed that impact assessments should be at the request of host governments.", 
    "CANADA, supported by BOLIVIA, proposed community participation in impact assessments.", 
    "On the question of how to define low-income communities, CHINA, with several Parties, said host countries should determine this matter. Delegates then discussed the use of GPG in monitoring small-scale projects.", 
    "BRAZIL and BURKINA FASO said project participants should determine choice of monitoring guidelines, while the EU, SWITZERLAND, and CHILE supported GPG as an efficient and transparent basis for generic project monitoring."
