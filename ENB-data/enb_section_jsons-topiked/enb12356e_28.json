    "The subgroup on water identified information needed to address vulnerability and adaptation regarding water quality, quantity and flow variability.", 
    "They identified information that currently exists but is under utilized, as well as information that needs to be generated, and explored variations across sectors.", 
    "Regarding water demand, the group concluded that demographic data is mostly available, but needs to be supplemented by additional information, for example on expected migration levels, in order to be useful.", 
    "They recommended that existing information needs to be further analyzed in the context of adaptation and vulnerability, and made accessible.", 
    "The issues of pricing, allocation and equitable distribution of water were raised by several participants, with one noting that scarce water is often diverted to hotels, to the detriment of local populations.", 
    "Another recommendation that was discussed was the need to link with existing processes at the international level, such as the World Water Forum."
