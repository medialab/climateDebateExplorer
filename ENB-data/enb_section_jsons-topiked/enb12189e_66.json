    "The draft decision on the establishment of the LDC Expert Group (FCCC/CP/2001/L.26) further outlines the terms of reference in an annex, defining the group as twelve experts, of which five from African LDC Parties, two from Asian LDC Parties, two from LDC SIDS, and three from Annex II Parties. The draft decision on guidance to the LDC Fund (FCCC/SBI/2001/L.12) requests the operating entity of the Fund to: meet the full cost of preparing NAPAs; adopt simplified procedures and arrange for expedited access to the Fund by LDCs; encourage the use of national and, where appropriate, regional experts; and adopt streamlined procedures for the operation of the Fund. The draft decision on guidelines for the preparation of NAPAs (FCCC/SBI/2001/L.14) decides to adopt the guidelines included in an annex, and invites Parties to make submissions with a view to improving the guidelines for consideration at SBI-17. Draft conclusions on the assessment of the status of implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.9 (FCCC/SBI/2001/L.11), adopted by the SBI on 8 November and by the COP on 10 November, note that prompt steps needed to be taken to expedite the process of provision of funding in support of NAPA preparation, and the need for a further assessment of the status of implementation of Article 4.9 at COP-9."
