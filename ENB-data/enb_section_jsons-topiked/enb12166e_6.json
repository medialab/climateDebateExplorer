    "A number of meetings and consultations have taken place since COP-6 Part I in an effort to get negotiations back on track.", 
    "Most recently, Informal High Level Consultations chaired by President Pronk were held in Scheveningen, the Netherlands, from 27-28 June 2001.", 
    "Over 350 delegates from as many as 130 Parties participated, including a number of ministers and deputy ministers.", 
    "The aim of the Consultations was to permit Parties to present to President Pronk their views on his June consolidated negotiating text, which he had presented as a tool to help negotiators reach a compromise.", 
    "In particular, Parties were encouraged to indicate whether these texts constituted a balanced package with sufficient 'wins' for all Parties, as well as to allow Parties to provide recommendations regarding the organization of work during the resumed COP-6. While some participants expressed the opinion that positions did not appear to have shifted since COP-6 Part I, others underscored that positions had possibly widened.", 
    "They also noted signs of entrenchment by some Parties, in particular on the subjects of LULUCF, sinks in the CDM, and the use of nuclear power to meet commitments.", 
    "The funding issue also appeared to be a potential barrier that could create problems.", 
    "Further rumblings were caused by Japan's ambiguity regarding its intentions for ratifying the Protocol.", 
    "Participants also expressed hope that President Pronk would take a stronger leadership role, and provide more guidance, rather than encouraging excessive discussion on difficult subjects."
