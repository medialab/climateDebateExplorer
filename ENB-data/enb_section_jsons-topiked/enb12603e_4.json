    "As the halfway mark of ADP 2-6 passed, delegates' thoughts turned into progress achieved so far: whether areas of convergence had emerged and if discussions were progressing fast enough.", 
    "Although some underscored the usefulness of discussions, the long list of issues still waiting to be addressed by Saturday night left many wondering, as ADP Co-Chair Kumarsingh questioned, if parties 'know what they are doing' and 'what they want to achieve.", 
    "' One area where divergence clearly emerged was that of INDCs.", 
    "Whereas most delegates agreed the world has changed since the adoption of the Convention, interpretations of what this means were situated on a long spectrum, between what some labelled as the 'one-size-fits-all' and 'bifurcated' approaches.", 
    "At the same time, a number of parties made explicit efforts to bring the opposite sides closer to each other.", 
    "A suggestion by Brazil on a 'concentric' differentiation created a small buzz, with many interested in exploring how to operationalize it.", 
    "The briefing on cooperative activities to build capacity for preparing INDCs was also welcomed by many as a useful space for sharing information.", 
    "All in all, with the long, autumn shades accompanying delegates on their way to evening coordination meetings, even the festival of light, Diwali, celebrated on Thursday as noted by Co-Chair Kumarsingh, was unable to fully lighten the mood, and some were already looking forward to the Lima spring to 'illuminate their thinking."
