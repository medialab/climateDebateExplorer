    "In the decision (FCCC/CP/2004/L.2), the COP: encourages the EB to continue to assess existing and new ways to ensure transparency; recalls that the use of the 'tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality' is not mandatory for project participants; and requests SBSTA, in collaboration with the EB, to develop a recommendation to COP/MOP-1 relating to the implications of the implementation of CDM project activities for the achievement of the objectives of other environmental conventions and protocols, in particular the Montreal Protocol. The COP also encourages CDM project participants to make proposals for new baseline and monitoring methodologies for types of project activities in sectors not yet covered by approved methodologies, including transportation and energy efficiency, and to intensify its work to ensure the proper functioning of the CDM, by, inter alia, developing a management plan.", 
    "The COP also decides on procedures for review and amends the EB rules of procedure, adding, inter alia, text stating that the EB shall, where it decides to limit attendance at its meetings, take all practicable steps to accommodate non-Parties to the Protocol and others to observe proceedings, except when the EB decides to close the meeting or a portion of it."
