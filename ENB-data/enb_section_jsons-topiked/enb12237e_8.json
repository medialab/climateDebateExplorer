    "The first week of SB-20 saw several signs of repetition in the negotiations while waiting for the Protocol\u0092s entry into force.", 
    "In one case, delegates chose to simply refer back to previous well-known positions, rather than repeat their views in the contact group.", 
    "In another, participants narrowly avoided re-negotiating a paragraph taken from the UNFCCC, before its origin was pointed out.", 
    "While participants commented on the need to deal with issues 'stuck in Neverland,' some observers called for creativity to reinvigorate the process."
