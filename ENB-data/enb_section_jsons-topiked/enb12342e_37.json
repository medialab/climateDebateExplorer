    "PAELLA OR JUST RICE?", 
    "Valencia's most famous dish is, without doubt, paella, a concoction of rice, saffron, vegetables, meat, and seafood.", 
    "What makes paella different from just flavored rice?", 
    "The three key secrets are: (1) a lengthy and elaborate cooking process; (2) varied ingredients; and (3) the special touch of the cook.", 
    "Like paella, the IPCC Fourth Assessment (AR4), and in particular its Synthesis Report, involved a long and elaborate preparation process, input from many disciplines in the natural and social sciences, and the touch of thousands of cooks - authors, reviewers and governments.", 
    "This brief analysis considers the process of elaborating the AR4 Synthesis Report, the way in which the IPCC has interpreted the recipe for a successful dish, and how it may influence the choice of ingredients in international climate change policy context, particularly at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali in December."
