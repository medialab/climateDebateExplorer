    "This question addressed the contribution of scientific, technical and socioeconomic analyses to the determination of what constitutes dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, as referred to in UNFCCC Article 2. Views differed over whether and how to reflect uncertainty in defining what constitutes 'dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.", 
    "' Views also differed over whether to refer to 'mitigative capacity' as one of the factors determining what constitutes such 'dangerous anthropogenic interference.", 
    "' Some participants expressed concern over including this reference, questioning its meaning and logic.", 
    "Delegates acknowledged the intellectual complexity of the issue but agreed to include the reference. Some participants expressed concern over lack of substance in the answer to Question 1 and proposed to include a figure showing that stabilization of CO2 concentrations would reduce the risks of climate change damages.", 
    "Others opposed this proposal.", 
    "Chair Watson recalled that Question 1 had been designed to provide a framework for reflection on dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, and not to present specific information, since doing so would result in a 'laundry list' of information and pre- empt the other questions.", 
    "Delegates agreed not to include the figure."
