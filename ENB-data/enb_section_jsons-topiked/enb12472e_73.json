    "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2010/L.4), the SBI recommends a draft decision on the methodology for the collection of ITL fees in the biennium 2012- 2013 for adoption by COP/MOP 6.", 
    "The draft COP/MOP decision (FCCC/SBI/2010/L.4/Add.1) recommends that the fees for the ITL paid by parties for the biennium shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that party by the budget for the ITL for biennium 2012-2013; and that if a party to the Kyoto Protocol with a QELRO that has not used the ITL decides to do so in the biennium 2012-2013, the scale of fees for the party shall be made equal to 130% of its Protocol adjusted scale for 2012-2013."
