    "This contact group considered the Co-Chairs' draft proposal for a draft decision on capacity building for developing countries that was prepared on the basis of Parties' comments on the G-77/CHINA's proposal.", 
    "Some delegates noted that the revised document did not fully take account of their submission.", 
    "There was disagreement on whether the draft decision should address countries with economies in transition.", 
    "The group discussed preambular paragraphs that: recognize the importance of taking stock of existing capacity-building activities, acknowledge that, though work has begun, substantial work remains to be done; recognize the main constraints to implementing the FCCC in developing countries; underline that capacity-building must be country driven in accordance with the FCCC provisions; and emphasize the continuous nature of the capacity-building process."
