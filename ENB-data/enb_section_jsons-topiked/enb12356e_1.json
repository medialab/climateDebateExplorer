    "Climate change is considered to be one of the most serious threats to current and future sustainable development, with adverse impacts already observed on the environment, human health, food security, economic activity, natural resources and physical infrastructure.", 
    "The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992, which focused on controlling and responding to changes in the climate.", 
    "Thus, the UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.", 
    "Along with mitigation of greenhouse gases, the UNFCCC also supports countries efforts to adapt to the impacts of climate change, through capacity building, technology transfer and funding to support adaptation assessments and projects.", 
    "The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now has 192 parties."
