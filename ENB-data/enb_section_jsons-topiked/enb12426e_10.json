    "In the afternoon, the informal group commenced with a technical exercise on assigned amounts and translation of commitments into QELROs, followed by discussion of aggregate and individual targets, the gap when aggregating pledges, and comparability and related criteria.", 
    "The Secretariat presented three scenarios for the establishment of assigned amounts: using the Protocol rules; minimal changes to the Protocol rules, such as application of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; and changes to the rules as proposed under the AWG-KP, including adding new greenhouse gases, as well as changing the base year and LULUCF rules. NEW ZEALAND emphasized that using actual emissions as a starting point more accurately reflects the costs countries face in meeting targets and avoids locking in current inequities in the Protocol.", 
    "She noted that there is limited risk of countries gaming the system by increasing emissions to get more permits in future periods.", 
    "The EU also emphasized that the starting point has significant implications for QELROs. JAPAN underscored that use of 1990 as the base year makes comparing levels of effort more difficult and that using absolute emission levels was preferable.", 
    "AOSIS stressed the need to retain the 1990 base year and percent-based QELROs so that they are comparable to the first commitment period.", 
    "JAPAN explained that the 1990 base year is far more advantageous to some countries and influences how reduction targets look.", 
    "BOLIVIA emphasized that an aggregate number is needed prior to determining assigned amounts. AUSTRALIA noted that they had increased their pledge and wondered if other parties had processes for reviewing their pledges because some had been on the table a long time.", 
    "IRAN highlighted the gap between pledges and aggregate emission reductions needed from Annex I parties to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations.", 
    "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION, supported by JAPAN and CROATIA, said that the aggregate range must be determined through a bottom-up approach.", 
    "BOLIVIA advocated allocating individual shares in a top-down approach.", 
    "AOSIS agreed, stating that the impacts on SIDS and the most vulnerable countries should be the benchmark for measuring the levels of ambition.", 
    "JAPAN, with AUSTRALIA, the EU and CANADA, emphasized that the aggregate range should be discussed in cooperation with the AWG-LCA.", 
    "CANADA raised the question as to how contributions to other international reduction activities, such as investment in R&D with broader implications for the collective transformation from business-as-usual to low-carbon economies, would be accounted for."
