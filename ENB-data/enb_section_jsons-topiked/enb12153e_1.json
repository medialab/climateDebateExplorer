    "The Welcoming Ceremony began at 10:00 am with the arrival of Her Majesty Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.", 
    "COP-6 President- designate Jan Pronk welcomed participants.", 
    "Noting the 'unmatched success' achieved by negotiators at Kyoto in reaching agreement on quantified emissions targets, he said COP-6 participants face the greater challenge of agreeing on the instruments and details to achieve these targets.", 
    "He noted that developing countries are the least culpable for problems resulting from climate change and have the least economic resilience, yet will suffer the most devastating consequences.", 
    "While acknowledging the significant differences between countries' positions on key issues, he said that reasonable compromises are possible on all issues, and urged delegates to take principled, balanced and credible decisions. Wim Deetman, Mayor of The Hague, expressed the hope that this would become the city where history will be made in the development of climate change management.", 
    "He particularly welcomed young participants and said it was important that their voices are heard.", 
    "Delegates then listened to readings by Dutch actor Aus Greidanus of short quatrains on climate change written by Dutch national poet Gerrit Komrij. In a pre-recorded video message to delegates, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan stated that the task of reducing greenhouse gas emissions was enormous, and would require 'radical change.", 
    "' He said success would require a credible rulebook on climate change, a new path and commitment to development, and a convincing signal to the business community that reducing greenhouse gases is in their best interests.", 
    "He drew attention to support at the recent United Nations Millennium Summit for every effort to be made to bring the Kyoto Protocol into force by 2002. Robert Watson, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), described the current state of scientific understanding of the Earth's climate system, highlighted the vulnerability of ecological systems, and underlined the need for effective policy and technological responses.", 
    "Noting that the last two decades have been the warmest in 1000 years, he said the question is no longer whether the climate is changing in response to human activities, but rather how much, how fast, and where.", 
    "He noted a projected increase in global mean surface temperatures of about 1.5oC - 6oC by 2100 (almost double the previous IPCC predictions), an increase in sea levels, and increases in the frequency and magnitude of the El Nino effect, and outlined the negative implications of these increases for water resources, agriculture, natural ecosystems and human health.", 
    "He highlighted anticipated decreases in precipitation in existing arid areas and underlined the likely increase in insect-borne vector diseases.", 
    "Underlining the need to decarbonize the economy, he urged governments to undertake significant technological and policy responses, and in particular to promote increased public and private sector research and development."
