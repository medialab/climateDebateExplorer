    "He suggested that the resolution of key political issues - the consequences to be applied by the branches and the composition of those branches - be given priority.", 
    "On the former issue, he highlighted the options identified in the report on the rate to be applied by the enforcement branch, and the differentiation between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties in the consequences to be applied by the facilitative branch. The COP took note of the Co-Chairs' reports to be forwarded to the Ministers as an input to their work.", 
    "COP-6 President Pronk concluded the meeting by saying he would consult with the negotiating groups' Co-Chairs and convene an extended Bureau meeting to strengthen the management process."
