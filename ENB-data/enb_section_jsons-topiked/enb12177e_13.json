    "The approved answer to this question states that emission scenarios project the following characteristics for 2100: CO2 concentrations of 540-970 ppm; an increase in globally averaged surface temperature of 1.4-5.8\u00b0C; and an increase in sea level of 0.09-0.88 m. The answer says that projected climate change will have beneficial and adverse environmental and socioeconomic effects, but the larger the changes and rate of change in climate, the more the adverse effects predominate.", 
    "It explains in more detail projected climate change impacts on: human health; ecological productivity and biodiversity; agriculture; water; small islands and low-lying coasts; and changes in GDP.", 
    "The answer also discusses the potential for adaptation to reduce adverse effects of climate change and to produce immediate ancillary benefits, but not to prevent all damages.", 
    "Several figures are included to illustrate the answer, including: socioeconomic, emissions and greenhouse gas concentration scenarios; temperature and sea-level change; and changes in annual run-off."
