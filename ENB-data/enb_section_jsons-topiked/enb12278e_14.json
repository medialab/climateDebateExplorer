    "The final text describes types of CO2 capture systems; explains means of transporting CO2 according to the distance and amount to be transported; and notes relevant technologies for CO2 storage in both deep geological formations and in the ocean floor, noting that ocean storage and its ecological impacts are still in the research phase.", 
    "The text also addresses the production of stable carbonates and certain applications in using waste stream; states that the abatement potential of industrial uses of captured CO2 is small; and describes the various stages of development of CCS components, noting that the maturity of the overall system may be less than some of its components. What is the geographical relationship between the sources and storage opportunities for CO2?", 
    "This question was addressed in plenary and in an informal contact group meeting on Friday.", 
    "Main issues under discussion included whether to indicate that most of the increase in large point sources of emissions is expected to occur in developing countries, and the geographical relationship between CO2 emission sources and sedimentary basins with potential for geological storage.", 
    "Delegates also discussed: regional distribution, technology maturity and locations for deep ocean storage; percentages of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel suitable for storage and capture; and the proximity of large point sources of emissions to potential storage sites."
