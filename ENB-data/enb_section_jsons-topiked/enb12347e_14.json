    "Most Chairs were quick to push discussions into informal or small group consultations, where the rule limiting the number of parallel meetings does not apply.", 
    "However, some delegates were wondering whether even this approach could deliver strong outcomes across all agenda items.", 
    "Time is ridiculously short to develop text, said one negotiator, while another observed that, with so many informal consultations, many delegates were double booked and unable to give each issue the attention it deserved.", 
    "I suspect that we will adopt a holding pattern on some of the non-critical issues and push back real discussions to SB 28, speculated one participant.", 
    "That way, we can stay focused on the important post-2012 issues here in Bali, she added.", 
    "Meanwhile, several delegates were commenting on a local newspaper front page story suggesting that developing countries had endorsed the GEF to manage the Adaptation Fund, with some claiming the story was misleading and unhelpful.", 
    "While the GEF involvement now seems highly likely, the exact nature of its role has yet to be confirmed, said one delegate."
