    "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2014/L.12), the SBSTA, inter alia : - encourages parties to draw on submissions, the technical synthesis and the report on the workshop on the mechanism; - notes its work on this matter is being conducted without prejudice to the work of the ADP on the 2015 agreement and pre-2020 ambition; - invites further submissions on the mechanism by 22 September 2014, including on its design and governance, possible elements of its modalities, meaning of 'a net decrease and/or avoidance of global GHG emissions', lessons learned from Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, relationship with the FVA and Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, and relationship with enhanced mitigation ambition; and - requests a technical paper on these matters from the Secretariat for consideration at SBSTA 41."
