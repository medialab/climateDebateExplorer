    "Participants spent many nervous hours Wednesday morning and afternoon as disagreements over the political decision agreed on Monday sent negotiators scrambling to patch up their differences.", 
    "Concerns about the substantive/political implications of some of the technical and editorial changes made to the political decision apparently resulted in some differences of views over which version to put to the Plenary for formal adoption.", 
    "Concerns also related to the level of the Russian Federation's allocated cap on forest management, with that country formally proposing that the figures it had allocated were 'preliminary.", 
    "' In addition, there were also questions about the best way to proceed organizationally with COP-6 Part II during its remaining days.", 
    "However, these issues appeared resolved by late afternoon, when the Plenary was finally able to formally adopt the political decision and set out its organization of work. Late Wednesday, participants' attention had turned to the negotiating groups, which resumed after the Plenary to begin cleaning up the various texts.", 
    "Some observers were suggesting that negotiators would have their work cut out to finish this 'technical' work on the outstanding texts by the end of Friday."
