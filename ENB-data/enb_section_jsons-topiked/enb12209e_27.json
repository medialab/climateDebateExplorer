    "The SBSTA conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.19) note that the responses of the IPCC and TEAP fully address the modalities, feasibility, resource implications, and timing for providing balanced scientific and technical information. The COP draft decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.19/Add.1) requests the Secretariat to bring the decision to the attention of the IPCC and Montreal Protocol Meeting of the Parties, and decides that the issue will be considered under the agenda item 'Cooperation with relevant international organizations' upon receipt of the acceptance by the IPCC and TEAP."
