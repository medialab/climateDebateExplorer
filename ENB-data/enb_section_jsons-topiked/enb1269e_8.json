    "A day after the US\u0092 expression of interest in differentiation, this hurdle to an agreement may be receding in discussions within the QELROs group.", 
    "Some participants say that a narrow band of differentiation could make deeper cuts palatable for some countries, resulting in a greater aggregate reduction in global emissions than otherwise possible.", 
    "Others would be satisfied if it at least makes it possible to reach an agreement that all countries can live with.", 
    "Some participants worried, however, about the impact of an agreement based on differentiated targets.", 
    "Pleas were heard that differentiation not become a loophole, as was the fear that providing a 'floor to ceiling' range would encourage countries to head for the floor."
