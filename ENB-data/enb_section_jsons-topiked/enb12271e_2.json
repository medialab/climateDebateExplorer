    "UNFCCC Article 4.5, which addresses the need for technology transfer, states that 'developed country Parties\u0085shall take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention,' adding that 'in this process, the developed country Parties shall support the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing country Parties.", 
    "' At COP 7, held in November 2001 in Marrakesh, Morocco, Parties decided to establish an Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) to support the work of the SBSTA in advancing the Convention\u0092s technology-related goals.", 
    "Since 2002, the EGTT has met several times, adopting work programmes and providing input and advice to the SBSTA on technology transfer.",
