    "They discussed encouraging developing countries to take into consideration relevant guidance under the Convention and other international processes concerning the provision of information on safeguards.", 
    "A number of developing countries opposed language on international processes, expressing preference for national processes.", 
    "Some suggested referring to intergovernmental processes, with one party highlighting that this reference would facilitate the consideration of guidance by bodies, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, but would exclude guidance from other types of institutions.", 
    "Delegates eventually agreed to delete the paragraph.", 
    "Negotiations continued throughout the day."
