    "The Climate Action Network has been actively lobbying G-77 countries to endorse the AOSIS draft protocol, which calls for a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 20% by the year 2005.", 
    "Meanwhile, others are trying to convince delegates that such a protocol is unnecessary.", 
    "The fate of the protocol is still uncertain both within the G-77 and in the Committee as a whole.", 
    "With so much concern over the adequacy or inadequacy of commitments, as evidenced by the crowds in Working Group I, many are looking forward to the discussion on this matter."
