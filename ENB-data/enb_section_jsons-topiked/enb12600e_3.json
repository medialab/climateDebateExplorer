    "As June's greenery gave way to crisp autumn air, ADP 2-6 delegates arrived at the lofty World Conference Center Bonn for their first day of work with many commenting positively on the informal consultations organized by the incoming COP 20 Presidency from 1-3 October 2014, in Lima, Peru.", 
    "They noted that the style of the Peruvian Presidency bodes well for a transparent and ambitious COP.", 
    "Others felt energized by the UN Climate Summit, with one delegate expressing hope that the ADP builds on the momentum generated.", 
    "This optimism was short-lived, however, as the mood in the plenary soon seemed to return to a 'negotiations as usual' mode.", 
    "The one and a half hour delay to the start of the session was, according to one delegate, a sign of bad old habits kicking in at a time when 'there is little time and so much to do'.", 
    "A few delegates commented that meeting the 2015 deadline seems all the more challenging, with agreement within country groups becoming more difficult, as illustrated by the lack of new submissions under workstream 1 by a number of key coalitions.", 
    "Discussions at ADP 2-6 over the week will show if parties are able to seize, as one delegate put it, the 'glimmer of hope' generated by the informal consultations in Lima and the UN Climate Summit."
