    "Thus far, the ADP has been dancing to its own music, at its own pace, and did achieve some progress in Bonn.", 
    "Yet, it is becoming increasingly clear that science is playing a different tune, requiring a quicker, more ambitious choreography.", 
    "'The message is clearer than ever, yet there is no sense of urgency here', opined a delegate while civil society called on countries to 'stand up or stand aside'.", 
    "The slow, self-conscious movements in Bonn will need to make way for a decidedly livelier samba in order to show the world that the ADP can deliver an outcome commensurate with the science.", 
    "Lima has a weighty mandate, including a high-level ministerial on finance, achieving agreement on elements of the 2015 agreement, determining information to be included in the INDCs, and reaching an outcome under workstream 2.", 
    "A mantra repeated during this conference was 'without Lima, there is no Paris'.", 
    "Eager to avoid the lethargy often characterizing 'in-between COPs', many delegates stressed the importance of outcomes on all aspects of the Lima mandate.", 
    "The Paris agreement is 18 months away, with little time for missteps.", 
    "To complete work in Lima necessary for success at and beyond Paris, delegates must learn to dance to the music that everyone else can hear."
