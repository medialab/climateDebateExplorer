    "With the People's Climate March flooding the streets of Lima on Wednesday, negotiators inside the UN perimeter experienced a different kind of 'deluge' as the draft negotiating text kept ballooning to incorporate what one delegate described as 'everyone's pet issues'.", 
    "Many suggested that INDCs had become the 'crunch issue', with one participant describing them as 'an opportunity to take hostages on the train'.", 
    "Reflecting lack of trust, which many felt underpinned the differences on the issue of INDCs, one negotiator suggested that 'if discussions on climate finance can be moved to a later date, so can discussions on mitigation'.", 
    "Another high-level delegate saw a solution looming on the horizon.", 
    "'In Lima', he said, 'we have the task of separating out issues that need to be resolved here from those that can be discussed in 2015'.", 
    "The day did not end early for negotiators under pressure to make tangible progress on 'slimming down' the draft decision text which, by the evening COP stocktaking plenary, with all alternatives proposed by parties, had swelled to 58 pages.", 
    "Delegates heading into what was expected to be a late night ADP session remarked: 'we have become too used to negotiating at the last minute.", 
    "Let's hope we can get enough from the remaining hours to work with ahead of Paris'."
