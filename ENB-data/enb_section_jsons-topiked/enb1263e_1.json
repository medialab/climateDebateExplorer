    "The Chair of the second QELROs non-group, Bo Kjell\u00e9n (Sweden), said consultations are underway on a paragraph covering countries with economies in transition.", 
    "Text on banking and borrowing will be taken up again once the other QELROs group has addressed emission budgets.", 
    "He said he had made proposals regarding trading and joint implementation.", 
    "He said the non-group hopes to polish texts and narrow differences so that various elements are easier to fit into a final agreement in Kyoto. Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil), Chair of the first QELROs non-group, said intense activity continued in contact groups.", 
    "One is considering differentiation, attempting to define criteria rather than a formula, which seems to be 'impossible.", 
    "' On the question of using single-year net emissions or a multi-year budget approach, he said the non- group is still struggling with how to deal with different gases.", 
    "Discussions continue on using greenhouse warming potentials (GWPs) or other mechanisms to account collectively for a number of gases. Chair Estrada summarized the activity of the non-group on existing commitments under FCCC Article 4.1.", 
    "He said the negotiations appeared to be in a 'time machine' with delegations repeating positions he had heard 30 years ago, the result: 'totally nonsense.", 
    "' Developing countries are asking for a specific reference to technology transfer; developed countries are trying to avoid one.", 
    "In paragraphs relating to financial support, he said delegates were developing a formula to specify which actions warrant full and which incremental support. On institutions and mechanisms, non-group Chair Takao Shibata (Japan) said the group agreed that the Convention COP should serve as the protocol Meeting of Parties (MOP), and that other Convention bodies should serve a protocol.", 
    "Specific functions of the MOP are to be decided.", 
    "Delegates are also discussing whether to use the number of ratifications and/or a percentage of total emissions as the basis for ratification. Chair Estrada said the non-group on policies & measures (P&Ms) was discussing three main proposals: the EU prefers mandatory P&Ms with consultations to coordinate their implementation; a number of JUSCANZ countries opposes mandatory P&Ms but may retain the ability to select some; and the G-77/CHINA is seeking criteria to ensure developing countries are not negatively affected by P&Ms."
