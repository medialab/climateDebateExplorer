    "The corridors of the ICAO building were quiet throughout the first day of WGIII-8, as most delegates were to be found in the plenary room participating in an exhaustive, and possibly exhausting, line-by-line review of the draft SPM text.", 
    "Several participants wondered about the pace of progress, noting that only four of 32 paragraphs had been addressed.", 
    "One observer noted that while the discussion ranged from the substance of CCS to comma placement, all aspects of the discussion are important given the need to provide policy makers with a comprehensive and readable summary of CCS.", 
    "Another delegate remarked on the level of involvement of a wide range of delegates in the deliberations, noting that this should help to ensure that the resulting text reflects the consensus of IPCC members, in keeping with the spirit of the organization."
