    "In closing, Chair Plume read her draft summary of some of the views expressed, which, inter alia, notes general agreement that: cost effective systems for estimating and monitoring deforestation and changes in carbon stocks can be designed and implemented, perhaps most suitably through a combination of remote sensing assessments and ground based measurements or a selected but representative series of plots stratifying the forest types in a country; guidance is needed to ensure comparable estimates when remote sensing is used, along with access to data, know-how, and capacity building; the IPCC Guidelines and Good Practice Guidance provide methodologies that can be the basis for estimating and monitoring emissions reductions and carbon stock changes, but they need to be better understood and their applicability assessed; addressing forest degradation is more difficult than addressing deforestation, but knowing the causes of degradation in countries can help in estimating of associated losses of carbon; new remote sensing technologies that may allow the estimation of changes in biomass will take some years to become routinely available for developing countries; reference emission levels should be flexible, adaptive, based on reliable historical data and periodically reviewed; the implications of different approaches for their establishment also need consideration; national approaches should be used for estimating and monitoring, but subnational approaches can constitute an initial step and be scaled up progressively; national coordination and joint work with all relevant stakeholders could provide an enabling environment for timely and effective capacity-building efforts; capacity-building exercises need to be scaled up in the future and focus on needs identified by countries; capacity building is needed in many areas, including on data collection and archiving, development and implementation of national monitoring systems and forest carbon inventories, as well as on remote sensing and its interpretation and application to national circumstances such as complex topography and persistent cloud cover; and discussions on policy approaches and incentives can be initiated given the current knowledge of methodological issues, while the implications of different approaches will need to be further explored.", 
    "The summary also notes, inter alia , that: it was agreed that further work is needed on how to address displacement of emissions, that broad participation is one way to do this, and that actions on REDD should result in real global emissions reductions; the view was also expressed that putting in place provisions to avoid international displacement of emissions should not lead to unrealistic requirements.", 
    "Some participants also expressed the view that as more resources become available to support developing countries, effectiveness of REDD activities must be ensured through, inter alia : focusing on specific needs of developing countries; avoiding duplication of efforts; taking into consideration potential co-benefits and synergies; and ensuring that the experiences gained lead to enhanced implementation of future activities.", 
    "The summary also notes that several cross-cutting issues were raised during discussion, including that: cost implications of more accurate methodologies should be carefully considered, as should the social implications of any REDD system particularly for indigenous people and local communities; the risk of diebacks including those associated with climate change, may affect the permanence of carbon stocks in the future; co-benefits such as protecting biodiversity and water resources should be promoted; choices of definitions could have implications for estimating emissions; a conservative approach could deal with uncertainties in estimates to ensure that there is no over-estimation of reduction in emissions; the contribution of natural versus anthropogenic causes in dealing with deforestation, forest degradation and carbon stock changes needs to be understood; and support from international organizations, in particular the UN system, will be important to advance the implementation of Decision 2/CP.13, the conclusions of SBSTA 28 and any further advance of REDD activities.", 
    "Chair Plume proposed, and participants generally agreed, to hold an expert meeting before COP 14, with limited participation, to advance understanding on remaining technical/methodological issues such as degradation.", 
    "Participants joined Chair Plume in thanking Japan for hosting the meeting.", 
    "Japan expressed gratitude to the people who had made the conference possible and called on everyone to keep up the momentum in Accra and Poznan.", 
    "Chair Plume drew the meeting to a close at 12:45 pm."
