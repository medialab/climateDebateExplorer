    "Gr\u00e9goire de Kalbermatten, CCD Deputy Executive Secretary, spoke on promoting synergies at the national level.", 
    "He identified key driving forces for creating synergies, including convergence of environment and development objectives, and the search for commonalities and coalition building among relevant actors.", 
    "He said the CCD Secretariat aims at strengthening institutional linkages and supporting country-driven initiatives such as national workshops to strengthen coordination at local levels and facilitating dialogue among key stakeholders.", 
    "He noted that Parties to the CCD have identified recommendations, including: integrating action programmes of environmental conventions; linking national action plans and national adaptation programmes of action; establishing liaisons between focal points of the conventions and GEF operational focal points through integrated project development; developing technical and financial strategic alliances; and increasing the number of national synergy workshops. Stressing the absence of a CCD financial mechanism and highlighting the beneficial linkages between poverty reduction, biodiversity and desertification, de Kalbermatten called for making CCD projects eligible for GEF funding."
