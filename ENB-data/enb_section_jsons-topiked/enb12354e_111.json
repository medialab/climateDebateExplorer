    "In its conclusions (FCCC/KP/CMP/2007/L.9), the COP/MOP, inter alia : notes that the workshop on the Russian proposal had allowed the Russian Federation to distinguish between the procedural and substantive components of their proposal and that it had helped clarify the intent and possible ramifications of the proposal; and invites the Russian Federation to introduce relevant items of its proposal during the second review of the Protocol under Article 9 and in the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action."
