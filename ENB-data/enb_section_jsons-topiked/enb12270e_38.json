    "SBI Chair Thomas Becker (Denmark) opened the session on Friday morning, 20 May.", 
    "Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter stated that SBI 22 was an opportunity to complete work on various issues left unfinished at COP 10, and to address other items, including improving the intergovernmental process, arrangements for COP 11 and COP/MOP 1, and financial matters. On Friday morning, 20 May, delegates discussed the provisional agenda (FCCC/SBI/2005/1 and Add.1) in detail, particularly additions proposed by Saudi Arabia on implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 (adverse effects) and 4.9 (LDCs) (FCCC/SBI/2005/1/Add.2), and one on capacity building proposed by the G-77/China.", 
    "The EU and Environmental Integrity Group supported the agenda without amendments, while the Africa Group and AOSIS supported adding an item on capacity building.", 
    "The Umbrella Group opposed Saudi Arabia\u0092s proposal and sought more information on the capacity building proposal.", 
    "Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Oman, Egypt, Algeria, Qatar, Pakistan, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates supported the additions. Delegates agreed to begin work based on the original provisional agenda while consultations were held.", 
    "SBI returned to the matter on Monday, 23 May, when Chair Becker proposed that those items be included under the agenda item on Other Matters.", 
    "Following informal consultations, delegates accepted the Chair\u0092s proposal and adopted the agenda (FCCC/SBI/2005/1 and Add.1)."
