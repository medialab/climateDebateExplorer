    "Co-Chairs Lacasta and Figueres convened the contact group and introduced an updated list, classifying possible improvements to the mechanisms based on, inter alia , whether or not they have potentially significant implications for the ability of Annex I parties to meet emission reduction targets.", 
    "Co-Chair Lacasta proposed consideration of big ticket items first.", 
    "Tuvalu, for AOSIS, supported by COLOMBIA and BOLIVIA, repeatedly objected to proceeding without inclusion of the issue of extending the share of proceeds as a big ticket item.", 
    "Consultations on the issue will continue informally. SWITZERLAND stressed that non-big-ticket items should not be overlooked and, supported by CANADA, suggested that further elaboration of some items may be necessary before parties could provide their views on the topic. SOUTH AFRICA stated that discussions based on the list were too general and called for a more detailed document.", 
    "The Co-Chairs will review party submissions and prepare a new document for consideration on Monday."
