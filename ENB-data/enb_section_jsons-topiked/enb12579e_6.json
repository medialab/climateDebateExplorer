    "During the morning contact group on REDD+, parties agreed to forward conclusions to the SBSTA plenary.", 
    "The forwarded text contains annexes with outstanding elements on possible draft decisions on MRV and reference levels; and three draft decisions for consideration by COP 19 on: drivers of deforestation; timing and frequency of information on how safeguards are being addressed; and modalities for national forest monitoring systems.", 
    "Many parties expressed satisfaction with progress in Bonn, with many indicating that their expectations had been surpassed.", 
    "Parties also highlighted that the text launches a process to address the two new tasks mandated in Doha on non-carbon benefits and non-market mechanisms. NORWAY expressed concern over the missing linkage between the provision of information on safeguards and results-based finance.", 
    "PAPUA NEW GUINEA and PANAMA said the REDD+ mechanism now has more meat, but still needs a spine.", 
    "BRAZIL highlighted intersessional work on REDD+ before Warsaw and stressed that instead of being remembered as the session that did not open, Bonn may be considered as the session that opened the path for impressive progress on REDD+ in Warsaw."
