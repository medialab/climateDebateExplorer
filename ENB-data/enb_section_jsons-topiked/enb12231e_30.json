On Thursday, 4 December, the contact group agreed to forward a proposal to SBI on guidance to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for consideration under the agenda item on the SCCF, and agreed to note that work on technology transfer undertaken by SBSTA complements work in other fora. In the contact group on Saturday, 6 December, Parties recommended amending text on support from international and other organizations.",
