    "This issue was first addressed by the SBI on Friday, 20 May.", 
    "The Secretariat gave an overview of the proposed budget, which consists of a 0.5% real increase in Euros, equaling a 22% increase in US dollars.", 
    "The Secretariat noted that while activities have increased due to the entry into force of the Protocol, the depreciation of the US dollar against the Euro has reduced the Secretariat\u0092s funding, given that most of its expenses are in Euros.", 
    "The US noted that it could not agree to either the budgetary increase or the proposal to fix the budget in Euros rather than US dollars.", 
    "The EU supported the budget, as proposed.", 
    "John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) agreed to chair a contact group. The contact group met three times between 21 and 26 May, while informal consultations also took place throughout the week.", 
    "The overall level of the proposed budget and the proposal to fix the budget in Euros continued to be the two main points of contention, while the G-77/China sought to ensure that commitments for four annual meetings of the three expert groups were met. At the contact group meeting on Thursday, 26 May, Chair Ashe presented a revised budget proposal consisting of total income of US$55,251,583, which was supported by the EU and G-77/China.", 
    "The US proposed reducing the UNFCCC budget by US$2 million, while Japan proposed reducing the overall budget by US$3 million.", 
    "Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter noted that a US$2 million reduction would 'seriously affect the operations of the Secretariat.", 
    "' Lacking an agreement, Chair Ashe closed the meeting and suggested forwarding the text to SB 23. Informal consultations, with the involvement of SBI Chair Becker, continued throughout that afternoon and evening.", 
    "The SBI plenary was suspended until Friday morning, 27 May, to allow for further deliberation. The SBI reached agreement on the budget on Friday morning.", 
    "The final agreement was for an overall core programme budget of US$53,501,583, which includes US$2,037,020 in contributions from the host country and US$2,000,000 in carry-over.", 
    "This represents a US$1.75 million reduction from the original proposal. At the final plenary, Jamaica, for the G-77/China, noted that the group had gone along with the agreement under great duress, and that it was 'embarrassed' to be part of a decision that sends the wrong signal to the global community about Parties\u0092 commitment to the climate change process.", 
    "She also noted that the budget has no specific activities for capacity building, which should be at the forefront of UNFCCC deliberations. Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter noted that the final agreement will not impact any of the three key work areas - adaptation, support to non-Annex I Parties, and infrastructure for the Protocol - nor the work of the three expert groups, or activities associated with the CDM, JI, and implementation.", 
    "However, impacts would be felt on items such as staff travel, training, consultancy work, the organization of in-depth reviews of national communications from Annex I Parties, dissemination of information, and development of a new UNFCCC website."
