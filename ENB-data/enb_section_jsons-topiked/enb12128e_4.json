    "Co-Chair Halldor Thorgeirsson (Iceland) identified key issues to be addressed during SB-12, including: consideration of the IPCC Special Report; preparation of Parties' submissions on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), which SBSTA-11 requested by 1 August 2000; and draft elements of decisions for COP-6.", 
    "Regarding Parties' submissions, he noted a decision taken at SBSTA-11 that SBSTA-12 consider reporting formats for the submission of historical data and, where applicable, projections.", 
    "The EU noted that it had presented a draft data-reporting format prior to SBSTA- 11.", 
    "AUSTRALIA presented its own proposed data-reporting format, noting that it takes into account discussions and conclusions at SBSTA-11.", 
    "He outlined the proposed data format and an accounting regime/framework for activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4. The US outlined its proposal for a data-reporting format, noting that it, inter alia: does not specify dates for historical data; excludes non-CO2 gases on the grounds that they might be an unnecessary complication; and includes land area.", 
    "She said it was important to recognize the uncertainty of projections, and said Parties should be able to provide information on the assumptions, and on the degree to which they may assume additional activities above business-as-usual. BRAZIL said the G-77/CHINA would be developing a negotiating position on this issue in the light of the new IPCC Special Report.", 
    "With NORWAY, he supported including land areas.", 
    "NORWAY noted the need to try and distinguish between different stocks.", 
    "Noting emerging convergence of views expressed on the data-reporting format, Co-Chair Thorgeirsson formed a smaller group to consolidate the proposals."
