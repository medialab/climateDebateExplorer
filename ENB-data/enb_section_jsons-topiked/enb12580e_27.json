    "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.10), the SBSTA, inter alia : - requests the lead reviewers to discuss options to improve cost-effectiveness, efficiency and practicality of the review process; - concludes that the review of national communications should be conducted in conjunction with the review of biennial reports in the years when both are submitted and agreed that the same information would be reviewed only once; - acknowledges concerns of parties with small-scale economies with the format of reviews, and agrees that further discussions on the specific format and combination of reviews will be held during a workshop in October 2013; - concludes that supplementing the expert review teams with a standing group of experts, or introducing service fees for review experts, could be explored; - identifies two alternatives to detailing and restructuring the work on the revision of the review guidelines: revision of the review guidelines for national communications, biennial reports and GHG inventories envisaging that the structure and elements of the review guidelines would include a general approach and specific requirements; or that the review guidelines for national communications, biennial reports and GHG inventories should consist of three separate review guidelines; - invites submissions by 15 July 2013, inter alia, on the scope, structure, timing, outline and publication of review reports, and specific views on key elements of the review guidelines for national communications and biennial reports; - highlights the importance of training for the review, in particular for developing countries experts, and requests the Secretariat to begin the development of new training materials and procedures, to be presented at SBSTA 39; and - requests the Secretariat to review the nomination form for the UNFCCC roster of experts and to inform parties of any changes."
