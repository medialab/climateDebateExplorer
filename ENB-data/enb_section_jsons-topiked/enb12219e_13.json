    "This issue was considered by the SBSTA on Wednesday, 4 June, and taken up in informal consultations facilitated by Harald Dovland (Norway), with the aim of identifying methodological work to be undertaken and considering elements of a possible work programme. On Wednesday, 5 June, the IPCC reported on its work to revise the 1996 inventory guidelines, as requested at SBSTA-17.", 
    "Delegates raised the need to, inter alia: identify methodological needs from thematic discussions; distinguish between methodologies for uniform application and those specific to national circumstances; and involve a broad range of scientists with expertise on different issues. On Thursday, 12 June, Harald Dovland reported on the informal consultations, noting that the annex to the draft conclusions, containing initial proposals by Parties on elements of a possible future work programme, remains entirely bracketed.", 
    "Parties then adopted the draft conclusions with the bracketed annex."
