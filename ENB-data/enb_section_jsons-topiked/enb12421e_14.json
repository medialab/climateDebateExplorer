    "She called for stabilization well below 350 parts per million (ppm), a temperature increase limited to below 1.5\u00b0C.", 
    "The EU called for a compelling overarching narrative on where the global community needs to be to address the climate crisis.", 
    "He stressed the need for an operational and concrete long-term goal, including a temperature rise of below 2\u00b0C, a mid-century global reduction goal of 50% compared to 1990 levels, and the need for emissions to peak by 2020.", 
    "The Republic of Korea supported a global goal of a 50% emission reduction by 2050, and called for a paradigm shift to a low-carbon economy.", 
    "India said a global goal for emission reductions cannot be dealt with in isolation from enhanced action on mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology, which should be addressed simultaneously and not sequentially.", 
    "He said stabilization, either of greenhouse gas concentrations or temperature rise, is inseparably linked to the question of an equitable allocation of the global atmospheric resource, which is needed for developing countries to achieve sustainable development.", 
    "Japan said the shared vision should be shared by the entire world, and urged all to take mitigation actions with an enlightened sense of solidarity, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities.", 
    "He said the shared vision should address the long-term goal, and that mid-term objectives and aggregate numbers for Annex I parties should be covered in the mitigation section.", 
    "He stressed peaking emissions in 10-20 years, building a low-carbon society and radical technological development.", 
    "Pakistan emphasized a shared vision as an equitable or fair sharing of the carbon space, and said long-term cooperative action should be guided by the best available scientific evidence.", 
    "Iran stressed the importance of the precautionary principle.", 
    "Norway said setting short and medium-term goals must be science driven, and that a 50% reduction by 2050 requires changes in consumption and living patterns.", 
    "China highlighted a mid-term reduction goal for developed countries of 40% based on 1990 levels by 2020.", 
    "He underscored that a long-term goal should be based on sound science and economic and technical feasibility, and on an equitable distribution of atmospheric space supported and enabled by adequate technology, finance and capacity building.", 
    "New Zealand said a shared vision should be a concise statement of political will, and stressed the need for a crystal clear long-term global goal for emission reductions.", 
    "The US said the shared vision should be inspirational and contain a goal for the world to aspire to, and stressed the importance of a comprehensive strategy at national and global levels to achieve a low-emissions future.", 
    "He said many of the ideas in the text may be more appropriate in the context of a high-level statement or COP decision, particularly those not relevant to the longer-term vision.", 
    "Supporting a long-term global goal for emission reductions, he said the metric still remains open and unresolved.", 
    "Noting the goal should be aspirational, rather than operational, he said reference to mid-term targets should be placed under the mitigation section.", 
    "Indonesia said the shared vision requires an integrated approach on how to define global goals through not only emission reductions, but through adaptation, finance and technology, taking into account the needs of developing countries.",

    "She said strong action by developed countries would give confidence to developing counties.", 
    "Uganda, for LDCs, said the shared vision should provide an aspiration and guide for all parties and people of the world.",

    "Iceland called for a clear, brief and easily understandable shared vision that inspires ownership by ministers.",

    "Switzerland said the shared vision should call for urgency, and provide a synthesis of medium and long-term aims.", 
    "He said language on a paradigm shift to low-emission development pathways should be reflected in the text, as should limiting temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C.",
