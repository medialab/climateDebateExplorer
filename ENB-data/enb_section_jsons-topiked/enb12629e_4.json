    "ADP Co-chair Reifsnyder asked parties to consider ways to streamline the section of the negotiating text on adaptation and loss and damage. Emphasizing the need to allow time for group coordination, Bolivia, for the G-77/CHINA, suggested addressing sections of the text thematically and, supported by Jamaica, for AOSIS, beginning with streamlining the text on monitoring and evaluation. The US made proposals for, inter alia, streamlining the text on commitments, addressing overlaps between monitoring and evaluation, and communications and reporting.", 
    "The EU supported addressing sections of the text thematically and suggested starting with the text on commitments. Saudi Arabia, for LMDCs, suggested deletions to avoid duplications, including in the text on commitments. Chile, for AILAC, announced proposals to streamline the text on, inter alia, long term and global aspects of adaptation, and commitments. TIMOR LESTE suggested streamlining the section on loss and damage.", 
    "AOSIS called for considering adaptation and loss and damage as separate issues. Delegates agreed to consider options to streamline the text on adaptation in the context of a facilitated discussion, starting with text on: reporting for adaptation; commitments; and monitoring and evaluation."
