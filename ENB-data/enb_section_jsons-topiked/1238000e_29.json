    "This round table was chaired by Suphavit Piamphongsant (Thailand).", 
    "There was broad agreement that Parties should have considerable flexibility in deciding policies and measures based on starting points and national circumstances, but disagreement on whether national action is adequate in all cases and whether some measures need to be mandated internationally.", 
    "Advocates of the former suggested a menu approach.", 
    "Others argued for a limited number of required or harmonized policies and measures because some desirable elements would not be implemented unilaterally for competitive reasons. Criteria for selecting policies and measures would include their potential to limit GHG emissions, economic cost, political feasibility and the need for common action.", 
    "Priority areas include 'no regrets' strategies, renewable energy, product standards, industrial sectors with high energy demand, CFCs, the international air and marine transport sector, economic/fiscal instruments, reductions in subsidies to, for example, coal, and financing mechanisms for economies in transition.", 
    "Also discussed were the possibility of developing countries acceding voluntarily to commitments, linkage of policies and measures and QELROs, and the need to amend policies and measures in light of new information and transparency."
