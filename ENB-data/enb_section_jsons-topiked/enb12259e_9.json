    "Sandra del Rosario Su\u00e1rez P\u00e9rez, Minister of Environment, Colombia, said her country offers numerous high-quality CDM projects, is vulnerable both to climate change and to the impacts of response measures, and called for ambitious emissions reductions commitments that are consistent with the best science and the UNFCCC\u0092s ultimate objective. Serge Lepeltier, Minister of Environment and Development, France, emphasized that tackling climate change provides economic opportunities and stated that inaction can be more costly than prevention. Stephen Kolonzo Musyoka, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources, Kenya, underscored that, for Africa, 'adaptation is the only way,' and that technology transfer is crucial. Pete Hodgson, Minister of Energy, Transport, Research, Science and Technology, New Zealand, acknowledged that mitigation has not accomplished much so far and that emissions are still increasing.", 
    "He stressed that no single technology will fix the problem. Tomasz Podgajniak, Under-Secretary of State, Poland, highlighted his country\u0092s transition to cleaner technologies while improving the economy, and called for mitigation policies that are not a barrier to development, but rather a booster for growth. Ali al-Naimi, Minister of Oil and Natural Resources, Saudi Arabia, reminded delegates of the cost that response measures would impose on oil-producing countries."
