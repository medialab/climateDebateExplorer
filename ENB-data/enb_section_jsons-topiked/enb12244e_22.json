    "The final session of the workshop took place on Wednesday morning, 29 September.", 
    "The session focused on outcomes and ways forward, with deliberations taking place in a roundtable discussion moderated by EGTT member Bernard Mazijn (Belgium).", 
    "Reflecting on the past two days\u0092 discussions, Mazijn reminded participants of the goals established for the workshop, which included fostering a better understanding of financing issues, sharing experiences and lessons learned, narrowing differences and generating new ideas.", 
    "He noted that there had been significant progress in participants\u0092 understanding of financing and that public and private sector representatives had started to speak a 'common language.", 
    "' He also observed that, while some of the financing options discussed at this meeting were not necessarily innovative in the financial world, they were new within the context of the UNFCCC. Outlining some next steps for the coming weeks and months, Daniele Violetti of the UNFCCC Secretariat indicated that a report would be prepared ahead of COP-10/SBSTA-21 in December 2004, and that a two-hour side event would take place at COP-10 on the issues raised by this workshop."
