    "MOROCCO, for G-77/China, called on the Russian Federation to ratify the Protocol and for the US to 'come back on board,' and expressed concern about the low level of financial contributions to the Secretariat. ZIMBABWE, on behalf of the Africa Group, said Annex I Parties have failed to assume leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lack political will to do so. ITALY, for the EU, urged the US to take actions comparable to those that would have been expected from them under the Protocol. TUVALU, for AOSIS, said the discussion on afforestation and reforestation under the CDM must maintain the social, environmental and economic integrity of the mechanism. PAKISTAN said work at COP-9 must focus on capacity building, technology transfer, and the SCCF. Highlighting the vulnerability of LDCs, TANZANIA, for the LDCs, stressed the need for the entry into force of the Protocol and constructive work on matters relating to technology transfer, capacity building and LDCs."
