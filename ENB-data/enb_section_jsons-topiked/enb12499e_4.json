    "Prior to COP 16 and COP/MOP 6, four negotiating sessions of the AWGs were held in 2010.", 
    "These took place in Bonn, Germany in April, May-June and August, and in Tianjin, China, in October.", 
    "The aim of these four sessions was to advance the work in the lead-up to the December Cancun Climate Change Conference.", 
    "Under the AWG-KP, delegates focused on the scale of Annex I parties emission reductions under the Protocol beyond 2012.", 
    "They also discussed other issues arising out of the AWG-KP s programme, including the flexibility mechanisms, land use, land-use change and forestry, as well as a basket of methodological issues.", 
    "Under the AWG-LCA, parties attempted to develop a negotiating text that encompassed all the main elements of the BAP, including mitigation, adaptation, technology, financing, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, including conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+) and monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV).", 
    "By the end of the Tianjin meeting, documents had been developed under both the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA, although these contained many options and much text that had not been agreed by all parties."
