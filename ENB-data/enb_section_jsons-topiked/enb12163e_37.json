    "On Monday, 13 November, the joint SBI/SBSTA delegates considered reports of recent intersessional consultations and agreed to reconvene the contact group on this issue co-chaired by Bo Kjell\u00e9n (Sweden) and Mohamad Reza Salamat (Iran) to continue consideration on the text of the draft decision(s). On Tuesday, 14 November, Co-Chair Salamat introduced to the contact group a draft proposal on the special considerations for LDCs, which he said could possibly replace the third section of the entirely bracketed draft decision(s) on adverse effects being considered in this contact group.", 
    "On whether to have one decision on Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Article 3.14, or two separate decisions, Co-Chair Salamat reported that legal advisers to the UN had indicated that two separate decisions would be appropriate, since the UNFCCC and Protocol are two distinct legal instruments, but that the decision on this issue ultimately rests with the Parties.", 
    "On the section on adverse effects, the G-77/China opposed text qualifying the assessment and evaluation of action related to adaptation. Delegates continued to discuss the text of the draft decision(s) on Wednesday, 15 November.", 
    "Brackets were retained around a sub- paragraph on 'demonstration adaptation projects,' and on immediate implementation of certain adaptation activities.", 
    "On a sub- paragraph on disaster preparedness and management, delegates discussed whether disaster prevention was possible.", 
    "Discussion on the proposed disaster fund was postponed pending outcomes of the financial issues group.", 
    "A Friends of the Chair group met several times in a closed session to continue discussing the text.", 
    "Delegates accepted the proposal by the LDCs to integrate the text on their special treatment into the adverse effects section of the draft decision(s).", 
    "Discussion on the proposed adaptation fund and the fund supporting specific concerns of LDCs was referred to a financial issues group proposed by President Pronk, despite the reservations expressed by the G-77/China, who held that the financial issues relating to the decision(s) under Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Article 3.14 should not be discussed separately from action outlined by the decision(s). On Saturday, 18 November, the contact group met for the last time.", 
    "Co-Chair Kjell\u00e9n introduced a revised Co-Chairs' text for the draft decision(s), as well as the text of the operative paragraphs on Article 4.9 implementation and a document including proposed workshops relating to Article 4.8 and 4.9, Article 3.14 and LDCs.", 
    "Delegates then debated whether information on which to base actions should derive from both national communications and other relevant information, or from just one of these two sources.", 
    "Kjell\u00e9n noted agreement on the inclusion of the operative paragraphs on implementation of Article 4.9 in the draft decision(s), but said the placement of this section would be announced by the G-77/China. During the joint subsidiary bodies meeting later in the day, Co- Chair Salamat presented the draft decision(s) (FCCC/SB/2000/CRP.18).", 
    "Highlighting the sense of cooperation in the discussions, he stated that the text was not fully agreed.", 
    "SBI/SBSTA decided to transmit the draft decision(s) to the COP, for its consideration."
