    "This issue was taken up in SBSTA plenary on 28 November, and subsequently in informal consultations co-chaired by Nagmeldin Goutbi Elhassan (Sudan) and Peter Brisbane (Australia).", 
    "Its consideration of the matter followed a request from SBSTA 21 for Annex I Parties to submit information on changes in carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions from harvested wood products, and on experiences with the use of the revised IPCC Guidelines and the Good Practice Guidelines for LULUCF.", 
    "These submissions were compiled by the Secretariat, together with other information related to harvested wood products.", 
    "However, since this is a complex issue that applies only to the second commitment period, and given the tight agenda at this meeting, parties soon agreed to take up this issue again at SBSTA 24."
