    "With so many issues being handled in various meetings on Friday, talk in the corridors ranged widely.", 
    "Some delegates discussed financing issues, while others chatted about technology transfer or praised the upcoming IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories.", 
    "Several commented that despite difficulties over SBI\u0092s agenda - which has still to be adopted - the general mood remained fairly positive. One issue that seemed to capture delegates\u0092 attention was the Secretariat\u0092s proposed budget.", 
    "An evening presentation filled the Haydn Room, with participants focusing on the implications of an option to fix the budget in Euros to address fluctuating exchange rates.", 
    "It also emerged that a Secretariat decision to drop a contingency measure to cover conference services and to rely instead on the UN General Assembly for future funding could prove controversial."
