    "The approved answer states that projected warming and sea-level rise will be smaller, the greater the emissions reductions and the earlier they are introduced.", 
    "Sea level and ice sheets would continue to respond to warming for many centuries after greenhouse gas concentrations have been stabilized.", 
    "A wide band of uncertainty exists in the amount of warming that would result from any stabilized greenhouse gas concentration.", 
    "The answer further notes that reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to stabilize their atmospheric concentration would delay and reduce damages caused by climate change, and that adaptation is a necessary strategy at all scales to complement climate change mitigation efforts."
