    "The seemingly endless haggling over text on the IPCC TAR was the talk of the corridors Wednesday night.", 
    "Having spent much of the last two days in heated discussions, negotiators identified arguments over proposals to refer to the ultimate objective of the Convention under Article 2 as a major sticking point.", 
    "Apparently, reference to this issue was opposed by certain Parties from both North and South, while others saw its inclusion as important for moving forward. Meanwhile, some delegates expressed satisfaction at the positive nature of talks in the P&Ms contact group, while participants in the group on adverse effects saw some minor hiccups finally resulting in agreement on the draft conclusions. In other news, a South-South disagreement surfaced late on Wednesday over adopting guidelines on non-Annex I national communications, with one delegate expressing 'frustration and boredom' with the ongoing polarization on the issue."
