    "In its conclusions ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/L.5 ), the AWG-KP, inter alia : recalls the six-month rule; reiterates that it will forward to COP/MOP 5 the results of its work for their adoption; requests the Chair to prepare a proposal for amendments under Protocol Article 3.9, as well as a text on issues outlined in paragraph 49 of AWG-KP 6 s report ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/8 ); invites parties to submit further views on matters related to the two documents and requests the Chair consider these submissions as well as other submissions invited by AWG-KP 7; and reiterates that it will coordinate its work with other bodies and processes under the Convention, especially its Protocol, with a view to avoiding duplication and maintain a coherent approach between the Convention and Protocol with respect to Annex I parties commitments."
