    "After many late nights of negotiations, the first week of the conference came to an end, with exhausted delegates leaving the venue early on Sunday morning.", 
    "In their weariness, some delegates pondered the wider impact of all their work, and many expressed concern over some Annex I parties' low or reduced mitigation ambition.", 
    "One delegate commented: 'we are supposed to be moving far and fast, but it feels as if we are moving backwards'.", 
    "In the streets surrounding the venue, over 1.200 people participating in a Saturday afternoon march for climate justice shared the same sentiment, displaying banners calling for 'System Change, not Climate Change'.", 
    "Some bleary-eyed delegates expressed hope that limited progress made this first week was only a warm up for the 'big game' in the second week when ministers arrive to 'flex their political muscles'."
