    "Andrea Guerrero (Colombia) co-facilitated the session.", 
    "Reporting back from the spin-off on loss and damage, GRENADA highlighted two proposals: from the G-77/China, placing a loss and damage mechanism with a climate displacement coordination facility in the agreement, noting that this mechanism would replace the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) after 2020; and from the US, the EU, Switzerland and Australia, addressing loss and damage through COP decisions, and capturing the WIM\u2019s permanence.", 
    "Co-Facilitator Guerrero summarized the spin-off\u2019s discussions on adaptation, including: the possibility of a long-term global goal or vision to reduce vulnerability and increase adaptive capacity; and potential means to achieve such a vision, including sharing knowledge, MOI, and improving science.", 
    "Spin-offs met in the afternoon to consider textual proposals."
