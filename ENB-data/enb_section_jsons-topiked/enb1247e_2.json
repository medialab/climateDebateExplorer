    "Chair Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania) convened SBI-6.", 
    "He reminded delegates that the SBI would not meet at COP-3 and must finalize a number of recommendations at SBI-6 and SBI-7 in October.", 
    "On the adoption of the agenda (FCCC/SBI/1997/7), he invited the Philippines to ask colleagues if they were also prepared for a preliminary exchange of views on proposals for amendments to the FCCC and its annexes (FCCC/SBI/1997/11).", 
    "If not, the proposals will go directly to COP-3.", 
    "SAUDI ARABIA, supported by KUWAIT, sought deletion of Agenda Item 9 on matters arising from UNGASS.", 
    "He said there was little of substance from UNGASS to send to COP-3.", 
    "The Chair noted that the item was simply for information. On administrative and financial matters, said the budget will have to be adopted at the current session of the SBI.", 
    "FCCC Executive Secretary Zammit-Cutajar introduced documentation on the programme budget for the years 1998- 1999 (FCCC/SBI/1997/10, INF.1, and INF.2).", 
    "He also drew attention to an informal document on the status of payments to the FCCC core budget and said the cash flow situation continued to warrant concern.", 
    "He said the level of initial budget estimates had been revised downwards but would remain above the 1997 level. He also discussed a proposal to maintain a post-Kyoto contingency fund for the management of any unanticipated process to emerge from COP-3.", 
    "On the Participation Fund, he warned that some linkage may be introduced between Parties\u0092 applications for funding and the status of their contributions. LUXEMBOURG, for the EU, introduced a formal statement on the programme budget for 1998-1999, noting continuing concern at the total amount of the budget proposals presented by the secretariat, and a proposed 50% increase overall.", 
    "The statement addressed: tasks requested by SBSTA where a deficit appears in the balance between these and other secretariat activities; conference servicing; any post-Kyoto intergovernmental process; review of overhead charges; volume of documentation; budgeting for in-depth reviews of national communications; remuneration of senior posts; the budget structure; and Convention Trust Funds.", 
    "The EU proposed a contact group to take the work on the budget forward."
