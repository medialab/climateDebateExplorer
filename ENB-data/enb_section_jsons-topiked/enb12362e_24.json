    "On Thursday, the AWG held an in-session workshop concentrating on GHGs, sectors and sources.", 
    "Katia Simeonova, UNFCCC Secretariat, discussed sectors and source categories, and related decisions, as well as reporting and review processes, under the Protocol.", 
    "Thelma Krug, IPCC, highlighted the IPCC s evolutionary approach, responding to new scientific information and noted the limitations of global warming potentials (GWPs) to compare short-lived GHGs with long-lived GHGs.", 
    "Jane Hupe, ICAO, presented on challenges faced by the aviation sector, including: sources, access, quality and comparability of data; and methodological issues.", 
    "She highlighted legal considerations and difficulty in attributing emissions from transboundary and multinational flights and flights crossing areas outside national jurisdiction.", 
    "Norway suggested that the Protocol s reporting guidelines should form the basis for the second commitment period with relevant modifications.", 
    "He also called for the inclusion of aviation and maritime transport (bunker fuels) emissions, and proposed market-based mechanisms, including a cap on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from shipping, a CO2 charge for all bunker fuels sold, and channeling revenues for adaptation.", 
    "He proposed a workshop to consider methodological issues and targets.", 
    "The EU stressed the importance of environmental integrity, and suggested using the latest IPCC findings on GWP.", 
    "Regarding bunker fuels, he: stressed that these emissions must be covered in the second commitment period; welcomed ICAO s endorsement of emissions trading in the aviation sector; called for cooperation between ICAO, the International Maritime Organization and the UNFCCC; outlined promising schemes, noting that different approaches are necessary for maritime and aviation emissions; and emphasized the potential for revenues to be spent on adaptation action in developing countries.", 
    "Japan said bunker fuel emissions must be controlled, and that reduction measures and methodologies should be treated simultaneously.", 
    "Australia, Japan, Canada, Singapore and China argued that work on bunker fuels should be taken up in relevant international organizations, such as the ICAO and the IMO.", 
    "Brazil, Panama, India and the EU identified the UNFCCC as the right forum for bunker fuel discussions.", 
    "Egypt and Brazil stated that bunker fuel coverage must apply the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.", 
    "The Russian Federation, with South Africa and Thailand, stated that issues of competitiveness must be addressed.", 
    "The Russian Federation called for more information on bunker fuel emissions growth, while the EU highlighted that sufficient information exists to justify the consideration of bunker fuels.", 
    "Tuvalu and Argentina supported further work on maritime and aviation transport emissions but urged considering implications of their coverage, such as to tourism.", 
    "Argentina and New Zealand suggested that national circumstances, such as geographical remoteness, required consideration.", 
    "New Zealand highlighted the possible perverse outcomes associated with altering GWPs.", 
    "Vice-Chair Konate highlighted parties support for the continuity of the current coverage of gases, sectors and sources.", 
    "On the inclusion of new gases, he noted that there were very different views, with some suggesting that the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories should form the basis of the second commitment period rules with a few minor modifications.", 
    "Regarding bunker fuels, Konate stated that many parties had said they were an important and growing source of emissions, but there was no consensus for their inclusion in the second commitment period or the role ICAO and IMO should play in regulating emissions.", 
    "He highlighted an idea for the UNFCCC to set a global emissions goal and for countries to take on a sectoral approach to meet these targets; potential mechanisms to generate revenue for adaptation funding; possible strengthened cooperation among ICAO, IMO and the UNFCCC; and that due consideration should be given to national circumstances and the needs of countries with heavy reliance on international transport."
