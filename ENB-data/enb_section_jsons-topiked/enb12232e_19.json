    "The section on inventories recommends that the UNFCCC Secretariat should collaborate with other relevant organizations to develop a central repository of information, tools and methods for GHG inventories, funding permitting.", 
    "These resources would then be disseminated to non-Annex I Parties.", 
    "The recommendations include a request that the Secretariat promote actions such as training and information sharing to help non-Annex I Parties prepare their GHG inventories. The recommendations also highlight the importance of reporting on gaps relating to GHG inventories, as this would help identify capacity-building needs and relevant financial requirements.", 
    "In addition, experts and institutions from non-Annex I Parties are requested to provide information on their national emission factors to the IPCC EFDB editorial board, and to use the information in the EFDB whenever appropriate."
