    "Another dichotomy that marked COP-8 was that of environment/development.", 
    "At the WSSD, States agreed on the falseness of this dichotomy, embracing the concept of sustainable development. During the COP-8 high-level round tables, however, it became clear that Parties do not share the same understanding of sustainable development.", 
    "Many African States linked poverty with climate vulnerability, and claimed that development depends on sound environmental management.", 
    "Meanwhile, other developing countries, supported by the US, used poverty eradication as an argument against new commitments, claiming that development is necessary for sound environmental management because economic growth provides financial and technological resources. The environment/development dichotomy was also present in discussions on LULUCF under the CDM.", 
    "At least one Latin American country made it clear during the high-level round tables that it considered afforestation and reforestation to be part of its development plan.", 
    "Uniting environment and development in this way, however, was not accepted by all countries.", 
    "Some claimed that sinks projects do not represent true development and could undermine the environmental integrity of the Protocol.", 
    "As a result, Parties remained in disagreement at COP-8 over the definitions and modalities for sinks projects under the CDM."
