    "During the afternoon contact group, discussions focused on MRV of mitigation commitments or actions by developed countries, based on questions by the AWG-LCA Chair ( http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/ad_hoc_working_groups/lca/application/pdf/1b(i)_mrv_questions.pdf ).", 
    "Spain, for the EU, identified the need to discuss legal formalization of emission reduction targets and clarify the pledges, including the covered sources and greenhouse gases (GHGs).", 
    "With Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, and Barbados, for AOSIS, he requested that the Secretariat compile information on developed country pledges.", 
    "The EU requested also compiling developing country pledges in the context of sub-paragraph 1(b)(ii) of the BAP.", 
    "He called for considering, inter alia : LULUCF; the flexibility mechanisms; annual GHG inventories; national inventory systems; accounting for targets; and compliance. CHINA said that rules on MRV under the Kyoto Protocol should apply to Annex I countries that are not parties to the Protocol.", 
    "He stressed MRV of Annex I countries targets as the focus of MRV, highlighting that there is no need for an overall MRV framework or for new MRV institutions.", 
    "The US, with TURKEY, called for a separate chapter on MRV.", 
    "The US supported the use of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and annual inventories.", 
    "He called for full national communications every four years with biennial updates on the economy-wide emission reduction targets, also including information on policies and measures, methodologies and use of offsets.", 
    "He said national communications should also contain information on support for mitigation, adaptation and capacity building in developing countries.", 
    "Highlighting the need for a full MRV regime, he noted that the first full communication should contain a low-carbon development strategy.", 
    "The US also called for biennial reporting from non-Annex I countries on their mitigation actions. NORWAY noted the need for a common set of rules for MRV and for accounting of emissions in relation to targets.", 
    "He also: identified the need to report on offsets and trading; expressed willingness to submit national communications more frequently; and suggested strengthening reporting on support to developing countries.", 
    "Barbados, for AOSIS, supported, inter alia , an international review process and accounting and reporting of emissions and LULUCF, as well as tradable units or offsets. JAPAN proposed the annual submission of inventories using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and enhancing the reporting frequency to every two years, with full national communications to be submitted with longer intervals.", 
    "He noted that biennial communications should be streamlined to present information on critical elements in a clearer and more focused fashion, with the continuation of verification of national communications by an expert review team. NEW ZEALAND noted that the current reporting requirements form a good basis for MRV for all countries.", 
    "On frequency of reporting, he proposed annual inventories, as is the current practice, streamlined biennial communications and periodic full national communications.", 
    "He also suggested discussion on streamlined biennial communications for all parties.", 
    "Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, emphasized that guidelines for MRV can be found under the UNFCCC and the Protocol, and that MRV should build on national communications.", 
    "He indicated that the current frequency of annual GHG inventories and national communications is adequate, while suggesting that the need might arise for adding further guidelines and new topics or for adjusting the frequency of reporting.", 
    "TURKEY said developed countries should report according to existing guidelines for Annex I countries.", 
    "He highlighted the need for MRV of support for developing countries, including NAMAs, and suggested reporting on the matching of actions with support, geographical coverage and capacity building. SOUTH AFRICA urged that MRV should cover Annex I countries aggregate commitments and reiterated the call for a technical panel on comparability of efforts.", 
    "He stressed the need for a compliance system for Annex I countries that are not parties to the Protocol, and identified the need for reporting on market mechanisms and offsets, and technical and financial support.", 
    "Emphasizing that the Convention does not specify the format for national communications, he encouraged elaboration of a more streamlined format. SAUDI ARABIA stressed the need for MRV to cover the impacts of Annex I countries mitigation policies on developing countries, urging that developed countries should specify their measures in order to minimize these impacts, and cautioned against the use of tariffs and barriers to trade.", 
    "Brazil, for the G-77/CHINA, called for a strong compliance mechanism and the application of the Protocol rules to Annex I countries, including LULUCF accounting.", 
    "He stressed the need for distinct sections on mitigation and MRV for developed and developing countries under sub-paragraphs 1(b)(i) and 1(b)(ii) of the BAP.", 
    "He also called for strengthening guidelines in different areas, including financial support.", 
    "Lamenting that discussions focused on reporting, SINGAPORE suggested that MRV should contribute to ensuring Annex I countries compliance and urged that the measuring rules for all Annex I countries are comparable and coherent in order to provide a clear picture of emission reductions.", 
    "AUSTRALIA said MRV should be regular and transparent and include information on targets, reductions, methodologies, the use of offsets and the provision or receipt of technical, financial and capacity building support.", 
    "He suggested annual GHG inventories by developed countries and biennial national communications by all countries. VIET NAM highlighted the importance of comparability of efforts and baselines.", 
    "BOLIVIA underscored the need for Annex I countries to report on the relative contributions of domestic efforts and market mechanisms to meeting their targets and noted the importance of financial penalties or target adjustments in cases of non-compliance.", 
    "The PHILIPPINES underscored that MRV is meaningless without compliance and called for a technical panel on comparability.", 
    "Chair Mukahanana-Sangarwe informed parties that spinoff groups on adaptation and market mechanisms would convene. ANNEX I EMISSION REDUCTIONS (AWG-KP): Parties focused on the relationship between the scale of Annex I emission reductions and LULUCF rules.", 
    "Reporting on the spinoff group on LULUCF, Co-Facilitator Iversen outlined the options and proposals for the treatment of LULUCF in the second commitment period.", 
    "He highlighted a proposal to include wetland management and noted that the largest impact on emissions would be from forest management.", 
    "He also noted that it was difficult to provide absolute numbers regarding the impacts of the different options but highlighted that the methods used will affect the qualitative impacts of the various options.", 
    "Co-Chair Charles invited parties to consider: how LULUCF can help fill the gap between Annex I parties level of ambition and the IPCC ranges; the possible contribution of LULUCF to meeting parties QELROs, and whether such contribution should be open-ended, capped or vary according to parties discretion; and what additional information is required regarding the role of LULUCF to enable agreement on Annex I targets.", 
    "The FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA stressed the need to ensure that LULUCF rules do not lead to a decrease in the level of ambition and to understand the implications of each option on environmental integrity.", 
    "The EU made a presentation showing the impact on all Annex I countries emissions of using: the existing LULUCF rules, under which most parties would receive mostly non-additional credits and which would provide no real incentive to take additional action ; the discount rates option, under which parties would get non-additional credits of similar magnitude to the current rules, with minor incentives to take additional action; the reference levels option, under which most countries would get zero crediting for business-as-usual, depending on the reference level chosen; and a historical reference year set at 1990, under which some countries would get large credits or debits, arbitrarily distributed, mostly relating to forest management.", 
    "Brazil, for the G-77/CHINA, noted preference for a net-net approach, with a cap on the use of LULUCF.", 
    "TUVALU said the impacts should be shown with absolute tonnage rather than percentages and also requested clarity on the assumptions used in the presentation.", 
    "UGANDA asked whether countries forest management methods and the nature of forests in each country were taken into consideration.", 
    "The EU acknowledged the possibility of setting a cap, but stressed that such a cap must not be too restrictive and must still provide an incentive for taking further action. NORWAY underscored the need for incentives to take action.", 
    "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said her country anticipates a significant contribution from LULUCF in the next commitment period, noting their pledged reduction of 25% with LULUCF or 15% without LULUCF.", 
    "Noting that countries have said they will adjust their targets depending on the rules adopted, TUVALU highlighted the importance of ensuring that LULUCF rules are the tightest possible to meet the environmental integrity requirements and not give countries too much flexibility to make adjustments to their pledges.", 
    "AUSTRALIA said her country s pledge envisages the use of LULUCF as fully as possible and objected to setting a cap on the use of LULUCF.", 
    "Papua New Guinea, for the COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS, supported setting rules before agreeing on numbers, and called for: reference levels that allow crediting for mitigation actions and that avoid business-as-usual credits; and accounting for forest removals and emissions.", 
    "The EU supported mandatory forest management accounting. BOLIVIA noted that the EU s presentation shows that the impact of the various options would be between 1.2% and 2%, stressed that this range is very small and said parties can discuss Annex I aggregate emission reductions, since the potential impacts of the various LULUCF options are known.", 
    "In response, the EU explained that the various options would have significant impacts on different countries individual targets, even though they will have small impacts on the aggregate target.", 
    "BRAZIL urged Annex I countries to accept the mandatory application of Protocol Article 3.4 (land management activities), stressing that these are generally source activities and leaving them out would impact the integrity of LULUCF as a whole."
