    "Morning and lunchtime contact groups, co-chaired by Ismail Elgizouli (Sudan) and Jean-Pascal van Ypersele (Belgium), were convened to discuss further work on new emissions scenarios.", 
    "Topics included the Co-Chairs\u0092 proposal to select a few, limited benchmark emissions trajectories to be used for the next round of scientific climate studies, the timing and funding for a technical paper following the AR4, and a suggestion by the UK to create a new task group.", 
    "The US proposed that the Panel, inter alia, reaffirm the IPCC\u0092s core function as scientific assessment, catalyze the independent development of scenarios within the climate modelling community, and request that the TGICA, in coordination with the Co-Chairs of the Working Groups, organize a meeting soon after the AR4 is completed to identify a list of desirable and feasible characteristics to be developed by the scenario development community to review information available for new emissions scenarios."
