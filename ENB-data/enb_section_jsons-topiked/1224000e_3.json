    "The Chair introduced the provisional agenda and annotations (FCCC/AGBM/1995/3/Add.1) and encouraged delegates to undertake discussions of the analysis and assessment under relevant agenda items in order to expedite substantive work. The PHILIPPINES, on behalf of the G-77 and China, stated that the focus of Item 3 is to make the commitments of Annex I Parties adequate, but noted that the AGBM must evaluate policies and measures of all Parties.", 
    "She highlighted document FCCC/AGBM/1995/6, a synthesized list of policies and measures identified in the national communications of Annex I Parties, but said that the AGBM needs to investigate the specific impact of these policies and measures on developing countries.", 
    "She added that the analysis and assessment process must be closely integrated with the discussion on policies and measures, and expressed disappointment that the technical advisory panels (TAPs) were not agreed upon during the recent meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technical Advice (SBSTA). SAUDI ARABIA stated that the AGBM must not dilute the main objective of the BM, which emphasizes analysis and assessment in the early stages, and that the agenda should include a separate item addressing analysis and assessment.", 
    "He said the agenda could be shortened by delaying the discussion on possible legal instruments, and stressed the importance of completing the Secretariat's in-depth review prior to taking any decisions. IRAN stated that the AGBM must perform a realistic analysis and assessment in order to have policies and measures commensurate with the situation.", 
    "He said that after policies and measures are produced, the AGBM must analyze and assess the impact of those policies and measures on developing countries. KUWAIT said Item 3 of the provisional agenda should cover analysis and assessment and a study of the impact on economic and social systems of non-Annex I Parties.", 
    "Inclusion of these ideas should be explicit, not inferred. SAMOA, on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), said the Secretariat's provisional agenda relates to and is controlled by the BM and the work of AGBM 1 and is therefore acceptable.", 
    "It addresses the range of issues delegates need to tackle.", 
    "He noted the Secretariat's intent to allow comments on everything, including analysis and assessment. CANADA and the EU supported the proposed agenda, noting that it is flexible and recognizes the priorities set by delegates. The Chair said the in-depth analysis by Annex I Parties would be considered by the COP Bureau and in the work of future sessions.", 
    "Analysis and assessment is part of the integrated work of AGBM, but a specific agenda item was not necessary.", 
    "He said previous discussions had reached a balanced conclusion.", 
    "The provisional agenda was adopted.", 
    "It was agreed to proceed according to the schedule and approach to the organization of work in Annex 2 of the provisional agenda. The Chair reported on meeting of the Bureau of the Conference of Parties.", 
    "The Government of Uruguay informed the COP that it must withdraw its offer to host COP-2 in Montevideo because the costs of the meeting exceeds the original estimate.", 
    "Therefore, COP-2 will be held in Geneva from 8-19 July 1996, and preparations will be the responsibility of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI)."
