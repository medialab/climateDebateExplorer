    "Co-facilitator Rosland requested parties to focus on the registry/mitigation mechanism, specifically issues relating to support for design, preparation and implementation of NAMAs, which are addressed in paragraphs 29 ter , 30 bis and 44 of the draft text (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/14).", 
    "He also requested parties to suggest ways of merging these paragraphs.", 
    "Some parties expressed concern that some of the issues in these paragraphs relate to the financial architecture, which they stressed should be addressed by the finance group.", 
    "Parties then discussed the possible structure and functions of the registry and the mitigation mechanism.", 
    "Disagreement remained on the functions of the registry, specifically whether it should be used to record all NAMAs of developing countries, both supported and autonomous.", 
    "Some countries preferred recording all NAMAs in an appendix to a legally-binding instrument and limiting the registry to record only supported NAMAs.", 
    "Other parties said the registry should be used to record supported NAMAs only and to match actions with support, and that a system for recognizing autonomous NAMAs on a voluntary basis could be decided at a later stage.", 
    "Some parties also highlighted that the registry should have an advisory or assessment role.", 
    "Regarding the nature of support, several parties highlighted that this should include technical, financial and capacity-building support.", 
    "Some parties suggested conducting discussions on these specific issues in a smaller working group, but there was no agreement on this.", 
    "Consultations will continue."
