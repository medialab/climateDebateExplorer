    "The informal drafting group on CDM technical issues, chaired by Jose Domingos Gonzales Miguez (Brazil), completed its discussions Friday.", 
    "The group was established on Wednesday, 18 July, to agree text on the following issues: baselines and additionality; small- scale CDM project activities; environmental impact assessments; public participation; review by the executive board; and transaction of CERs.", 
    "Text was agreed on the issues on the basis that once a decision on the inclusion of sinks in the CDM has been taken, this would need to be revisited.", 
    "On small scale CDM project activities, agreement has not been reached on the scales relating to renewable energy project activities, energy efficiency improvement project activities, or other project activities that both reduce anthropogenic emissions by sources and that directly emit less than a certain amount of kilo tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually.", 
    "A request has been made that experts from Parties may put forward some examples of project activities to the Secretariat that illustrate the quoted figures.", 
    "The full text on all the issues will be revisited next week when negotiations resume at the diplomatic level."
