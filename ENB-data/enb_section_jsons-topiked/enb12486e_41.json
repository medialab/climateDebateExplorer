    "In the preamble of its decision, which is designed to serve as the chapeau to all the IPCC decisions, the IPCC: welcomed the IAC Review and its recommendations as an important way to improve how the IPCC works and is governed on behalf of the thousands of scientists who conduct careful and thorough assessments on all aspects of climate change and on behalf of the global community that utilizes its work; took decisive action to respond to these recommendations in a way that is transparent and open, and ensures the highest quality assessments are produced and made available to the international community; and agreed to implement many of the recommendations and establish task groups on others to undertake further work with a view to adopting decisions at IPCC-33.",
