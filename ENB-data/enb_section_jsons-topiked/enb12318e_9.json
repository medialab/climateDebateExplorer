    "Parties considered the provisional agenda (FCCC/CP/2005/1), with the exception of the item on the second review of the adequacy of UNFCCC Article 4.2(a) and (b) (policies and measures on emissions and removals from sinks), which has been held in abeyance at every COP since COP 4.", 
    "Parties discussed an agenda item on small island developing states (SIDS), with the US noting overlaps with other agenda items, and Tuvalu stressing that removing this item would send a signal that the international community is not concerned about SIDS \u0092 welfare.", 
    "This item also appeared on the provisional agendas of the SBI ( FCCC/SBI/2006/12 & Add.1) and SBSTA ( FCCC/SBSTA/2006/6 ), and was the subject of informal consultations.", 
    "While some SIDS wanted a specific COP agenda item on SIDS \u0092 issues, including on the Mauritius Strategy, other parties, including the US, argued that it was covered under other items and should not be dealt with under multiple agendas, or should even be removed altogether.", 
    "A compromise was eventually agreed whereby the item was included under Other Matters under the SBI agenda.", 
    "Regarding COP 12's organization of work, President Kibwana noted agreement at SBI 24 that meetings after 6:00 pm should only be held under exceptional circumstances, and said the Bureau would decide whether such circumstances exist."
