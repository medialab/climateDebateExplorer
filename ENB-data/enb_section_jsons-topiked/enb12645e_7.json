    "In response to public criticism of the IPCC related to inaccuracies in AR4 and the Panel\u2019s response to the criticism, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and IPCC Chair Pachauri requested the IAC to conduct an independent review of IPCC processes and procedures and to present recommendations to strengthen the IPCC and to ensure the quality of its reports.", 
    "The IAC presented its results in a report in August 2010 and made recommendations regarding, inter alia: the IPCC\u2019s management structure; a communications strategy, including a plan to respond to crises; transparency, including criteria for selecting participants and the type of scientific and technical information to be assessed; and consistency in how the WGs characterize uncertainty."
