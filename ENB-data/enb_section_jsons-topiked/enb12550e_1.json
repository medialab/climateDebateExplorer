    "Hugh Sealy, Grenada, outlined AOSIS expectations that the framework: define relationships between the UNFCCC and other approaches, and between market and non-market approaches; deliver real mitigation benefits; and not allow countries to evade their obligations under the Convention.", 
    "Matt Paterson, New Zealand, suggested that the framework could be a library of approaches or a forum that coordinates efforts, and would not compete with or duplicate existing UNFCCC measures.", 
    "He proposed inviting countries to provide information and practical examples of schemes they have adopted or may adopt.", 
    "Alex Hanafi, Environmental Defense Fund, suggested the framework could provide guidelines for national and subnational jurisdictions to trade emissions internationally, highlighting transparency as a key element of ensuring environmental and market integrity.", 
    "He said the framework could encourage broad participation in mitigation efforts, but at the risk of a low level of ambition.", 
    "He suggested that parties are given access to the GCF provided they have a harmonized MRV system.", 
    "Sealy questioned whether the principles of supplementarity and shared profits would be part of the framework, and cautioned against neglecting the potential of non-market mechanisms."
