    "In its decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2007/L.8), the COP/MOP, among other things, agrees that the review will aim to enhance implementation of the Protocol and further elaborate on a number of its elements, including adaptation.", 
    "The COP/MOP also: agrees that the review will be based on the best available science, including the IPCC AR4; reiterates that the review does not prejudge action decided by COP/MOP or lead to new commitments for any party; acknowledges that parties can take into account results from relevant activities under the Convention and Protocol in preparing for the second review; recognizes that the COP/MOP shall take action based on the results of the second review; and requests the Secretariat to organize a workshop and prepare a report on progress of the AWG by October 2008.", 
    "The COP/MOP also invites submissions, by 7 March 2008, of views on: extending the share of proceeds to JI and emissions trading to fund adaptation; procedures for inscribing commitments for Annex I parties in Annex B; privileges and immunities; scope, effectiveness and functioning of the flexible mechanisms, including regional distribution of CDM projects; and minimization of adverse effects."
