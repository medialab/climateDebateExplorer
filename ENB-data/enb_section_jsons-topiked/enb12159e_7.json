    "The corridors were buzzing Monday evening as delegates pondered over the outcome of the afternoon's informal high-level meeting, and speculated on the next steps that President Pronk will be suggesting Tuesday morning.", 
    "The US move to add hard numbers to its proposal on LULUCF was seen by some as a pre-emptive compromise and a set back to the hard line position of countries that oppose additional activities.", 
    "Others, though, characterized the proposal as a 'fudge,' arguing that the proposed full credit for 20 million metric tonnes of carbon is more than generous. The manner in which President Pronk intends to try to organize the informal high-level meetings is still raising questions among delegates.", 
    "Many participants had arrived at the high-level meeting on Monday expecting to hear President Pronk's proposal on how to deal effectively with the many remaining key issues.", 
    "Some were questioning the extent to which the demand for transparency will either impede or increase the efficiency of the negotiations.", 
    "Given the G-77/China's opposition to an informal proposal to split negotiations into three issue clusters, participants wonder how President Pronk will proceed. Another relevant point of discussion has been the the sequence in which ministers should take up the 'crunch issues,' with the G-77/China pushing to prioritize financial commitments and other key issues for developing countries."
