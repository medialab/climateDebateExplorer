    "COP-5 will not take place in Jordan, as announced in Buenos Aires.", 
    "Instead it will take place in Bonn, a modest city of gentle pace and routine.", 
    "It is an altogether understated location.", 
    "Yet Bonn will be an appropriate venue for COP-5, which has already been described as essentially another 'technical' meeting on the way to the bigger prize of COP-6.", 
    "COP-5 will set the stage for the further emergence and clarification of political issues and hopefully the final removal of the 'invisible brackets' at COP-6.", 
    "The iron law of negotiation is that minimum levels of 'negotiating capital' must be accumulated and reserved until the final round."
