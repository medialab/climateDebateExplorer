    "A decision on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries is as significant for the wider deforestation debate as it is for the climate regime.", 
    "As one observer put it, the deforestation issue has suffered from a level of fragmentation and now, perhaps for the first time, may ultimately be brought under a legally binding framework.", 
    "There was an agreement to launch a process for understanding the challenges ahead, including through demonstration activities over the next two years, in preparation for addressing these issues in a post-2012 agreement.", 
    "A problematic part of this debate was how to include the issue in the post-2012 regime.", 
    "The US supported a reference to land use in the decision on reducing emissions from deforestation, alarming some observers as it recalled broader discussions of land use that included not only forestry but also agriculture and other forms of land management.", 
    "There was, however, agreement to open up options in future discussions on long-term cooperative action by including in the decision an explicit reference to reduced emissions from deforestation and consideration of the role of conservation, sustainable management of forest and enhancement of forest carbon stocks."
