    "Participants reported little movement in the negotiating group on advancing the implementation of FCCC Article 4.1 (Article 12 in the negotiating text), which is being co- chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) and Bo Skjell\u00e9n (Sweden).", 
    "Industrialized nations favored alternative text under which all Parties would, inter alia, implement national and regional programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change and facilitate adequate adaptation.", 
    "Developing countries preferred an alternative stating that developed countries shall incorporate QELROs and P&Ms into their national programmes.", 
    "Developed countries would also specify measure taken to finance technology transfer, provide financial resources and assist in meeting the costs of adaptation. Some delegates expressed concern over who would bear the costs of proposals to, inter alia, formulate programmes to improve protection measures for infrastructure and deploy adaptation technologies.", 
    "On Article 13 (financial resources), some developing countries objected to bracketed language that would have financial resources to meet their full agreed costs provided [through the mechanism defined by the Convention]."
