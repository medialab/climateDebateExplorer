    "In the morning, the group on other issues held informal consultations focusing on the flexibility mechanisms.", 
    "The discussions were based on a new Chair s non-paper compiling proposals for elements of draft COP/MOP decisions on emissions trading and the project-based mechanisms.", 
    "Parties focused on paragraphs relating to: the development of standardized, multi-project baselines under the CDM; and improving regional distribution of, and access to, CDM projects.", 
    "On text relating to the development of standardized, multi-project baselines, some parties objected to the proposal to define standardized baselines.", 
    "Others supported the proposal, while preferring that the use of standardized baselines be optional.", 
    "Other parties expressed preference for making the standardized baselines mandatory and clarified that such baselines would take account of national and regional circumstances and would therefore not constitute a barrier to CDM project development.", 
    "On improving regional distribution and access to project activities under the CDM, several parties opposed text indicating that certain specified project activities shall be assumed to meet the requirement of additionality, noting that the additionality of projects cannot be taken for granted.", 
    "Several parties also opposed text on a geographically balanced system of quotas, with some noting that such a limit could affect the viability of the CDM."
