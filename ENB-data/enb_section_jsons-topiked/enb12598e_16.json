    "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2014/L.8), the SBI, inter alia : - takes note of and invites the GEF to continue providing information on financial support for the preparation of BURs; - urges non-Annex I parties that have yet to submit their requests to the GEF for support, and encourages the GEF implementing agencies to continue facilitating the preparation and submission of project proposals by non-Annex I parties; - recommends that COP 20 request the GEF to continue to work with its implementing agencies to further simplify its procedures and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the process through which non-Annex I parties receive funding; and - requests the Secretariat to make updated versions of the national GHG inventory software for non-Annex I parties available in other UN languages by June 2015."
