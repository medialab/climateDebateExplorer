    "They discussed implications of using either the IPCC Second Assessment Report or Fourth Assessment Report on overall and parties individual emissions.", 
    "Some parties highlighted the importance of using methodologies that are consistent with the AWG-LCA.",

    "The text includes new language on, inter alia : historical and current global emissions; stabilizing GHG concentrations at well below 350 parts per million; collectively reducing emissions by at least 50% from 1990 levels by 2050; reducing GHG emissions of developed countries by 85-95%, or more than 95%, from 1990 levels by 2050; and respecting human rights.", 
    "A number of developing countries opposed picking and choosing between parties submissions.",

    "Several developed countries suggested using the facilitator s text as a middle ground, while some developing countries said there was no agreement on whether to proceed, because of the absence of a party-driven text.",
