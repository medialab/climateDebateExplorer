    "The Workshop on Compliance under the Protocol was opened by Co-Chair Amb.", 
    "Tuiloma Neroni Slade.", 
    "He informed participants that the Co-Chairs, in pursuance of their mandate from COP-5 to consult widely, had convened an informal consultation in Montreux, Switzerland, from 9-11 February 2000.", 
    "Based on the results of this consultation and 15 written submissions from Parties, the Co-Chairs had prepared a working paper outlining the elements of a compliance system for consideration during the workshop.", 
    "Co-Chair Slade described the workshop as an informal exchange of views, not a negotiating session, aimed at providing the Co-Chairs with a better understanding of Parties' positions so as to enable them to formulate a paper for consideration at SB-12.", 
    "He identified the need to discuss four groups of issues: general issues, including nature, principles and scope of application; functions and institutional arrangements for carrying out functions; outcomes and consequences of non-compliance; and other issues, including relationship with Articles 16 (MCP) and 19 (dispute settlement)."
