    "There was relief among some delegates at the resolution of the dispute over the agenda item on Decision 1/CP.10 in the short SBI plenary on Thursday.", 
    "This means we can now start talking about adaptation under this agenda item in earnest, said one observer.", 
    "However, others lamented that the way the item was resolved will mean that the discussion on impacts of climate change and impacts of response measures will remain as conjoined twins with no possibility of surgery to separate them.", 
    "Many delegates, though, seemed to be engaged in a procession of contact group, informal, drafting group and bilateral discussions throughout Thursday, as parties continued to work through the nitty gritty details of the SBI and SBSTA agendas.", 
    "Don't ask me what the big picture looks like- right now I can't see the wood for trees!", 
    "said one participant emerging from the deforestation discussions."
