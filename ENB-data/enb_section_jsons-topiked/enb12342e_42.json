    "RICE OR PAELLA, DOES IT MATTER?", 
    "The balanced mix of very different ingredients is difficult to attain, but in the complementary flavors lies the uniqueness of the dish.", 
    "A great deal of effort has been put in the Synthesis Report to take the findings of the different working groups and blend them together.", 
    "The fact that an entire IPCC session is devoted to elaborate a Synthesis Report, rather than, for example, asking each working group to produce five pages that can be pasted together, shows the importance attributed to the SYR SPM, which is likely to be the most widely read document produced by the IPCC.", 
    "But is it paella or is it rice?", 
    "While this can be an interesting debate for culinary aficionados and academics, if you ask someone who is hungry, what matters is having food on your plate.", 
    "In this sense, the most important aspect of the AR4 Synthesis Report is not whether it synthesizes or compiles the working groups \u0092 findings, but whether it contains all the relevant information, including an end to uncertainty about climate change and its causes, the existence of multiple affordable options for mitigation and adaptation, and the urgency of action.", 
    "And much of the world is hungry.", 
    "Hungry for action on climate change."
