    "Issues related to LULUCF were discussed at the in-session workshop on Wednesday.", 
    "Maria Jos\u00e9 Sanz, UNFCCC Secretariat, provided an overview of the provisions and decisions related to LULUCF under the Protocol.", 
    "Peter Holmgren, United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, stressed the need for monitoring in accounting, and synergies between forest monitoring in addressing climate change and other environmental problems.", 
    "Jim Penman, IPCC, noted scientific advances addressing many of the pre-Kyoto fears regarding forest management.", 
    "He suggested: considering LULUCF in the context of REDD; simplifying rules for CDM sink projects; dealing with harvested wood products (HWP); and, regarding permanence risks, implementing longer averaging periods or taking on conservative assessments to account for possible losses.", 
    "Japan presented on national experiences, highlighting enhanced sink policies and measures, which are broadening participation and utilization of products and biomass.", 
    "The EU suggested reviewing and simplifying accounting rules, without creating perverse incentives, and enhancing removals from sustainable biomass for energy and HWP.", 
    "New Zealand discussed experiences in incorporating LULUCF in its emissions trading scheme and identified LULUCF rules under the Protocol that should be reviewed, especially those related to land use change, which has had significant effects on the dynamic land use in New Zealand, and the practicality of forest management rules.", 
    "Canada proposed three key enhancements: improving incentive structures for sustainable land management; assessing the life cycle of carbon stocks; and greater focus on distinguishing anthropogenic emissions and removals.", 
    "He proposed a LULUCF sub-group take up this issue.", 
    "Australia noted that parties should not foreclose new options for mitigation under LULUCF and favored the review of current rules to ensure simplicity without perverse incentives.", 
    "He said effective monitoring systems are now available to allow for more accurate accounting.", 
    "Tuvalu urged parties not to rewrite the existing rules and principles, noting it may be necessary to reconsider IPCC guidelines on managed and unmanaged land.", 
    "He stated that CDM activities should remain restricted to afforestation and reforestation projects.", 
    "Supporting Tuvalu, Brazil said that if activities under Article 3.4 (additional human induced activities) were expanded, the IPCC should be invited to re-assess the issue of factoring out to enhance understanding of anthropogenic versus natural carbon stock changes.", 
    "In the discussion on LULUCF, as outlined in Protocol Articles 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 pertaining to Annex I counties, China opposed major modifications for the second commitment period and stressed that provisions on LULUCF should apply only to Annex B countries.", 
    "Tuvalu called for a political link between LULUCF rules and commitment levels.", 
    "Malaysia called for streamlining and strengthening of rules, such as forest management.", 
    "He also proposed standardizing rules to be consistent for removals from peatlands and noted potential linkages with REDD.", 
    "The Russian Federation supported simpler, more efficient inventory procedures.", 
    "On LULUCF under the CDM, Uganda supported amending the rules, citing socioeconomic development and mitigation benefits of forests.", 
    "Brazil and Samoa warned against sacrificing the environmental integrity of the CDM, while Australia and Switzerland asserted that rules can be simplified while maintaining stringency in environmental outcomes.", 
    "Benin and Senegal highlighted linkages between Africa s participation in the carbon market and the role of forestry.", 
    "The Global Environmental Centre and Wetlands International called for a process to evaluate the contribution of peatland management to the LULUCF sector.", 
    "Climate Action Network International called for the protection of biodiversity and indigenous rights in the LULUCF sector.", 
    "In summing up the key elements, Chair Dovland identified LULUCF as one of the most complex issues and recognized consensus on continuing the use of the principle from decision 16/CMP.1 (LULUCF) and ensure environmental integrity.", 
    "Regarding the second commitment period rules, he suggested there were divergent views with some encouraging holistic approaches to LULUCF and agriculture and others wanting very few modifications to the rules agreed for the first commitment period.", 
    "However, he noted that there was a general desire to avoid discontinuity between commitment periods or adopting dramatically different systems.", 
    "Contentious issues related to new pools, such as HWP.", 
    "He also noted the potential for LULUCF to contribute to sustainable forest management and biodiversity protection."
