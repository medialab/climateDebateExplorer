    "The Panel agreed that: a small team of delegates will work with Chair Pachauri and the Secretariat to conduct a review of the terms of reference for consideration at IPCC-26; if acceptable to the Panel, the review could be presented by Chair Pachauri on behalf of the IPCC to the next session of the WMO Congress in 2007; and the review will be conducted primarily via electronic means as a meeting is not likely to be necessary."
