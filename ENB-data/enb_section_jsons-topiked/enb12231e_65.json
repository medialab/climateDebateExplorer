    "It also decides to review the progress, need for continuation, and terms of reference of the LEG at COP-11. In the decision on review of the guidelines for the preparation of NAPAs (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.29/Add.1), the COP decides that no revision of the guidelines is necessary at this time. In the decision on further guidance on the operation of the LDC Fund (FCCC/CP/2003/L.9), the COP decides to adopt the further guidance to an entity entrusted with the operation of the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC for the operation of the LDC Fund.", 
    "The COP requests the entity to take into account various elements when developing operational guidelines for funding the implementation of NAPAs, including: the need to ensure a country-driven approach, in line with national priorities, which ensures cost-effectiveness and complementarity with other funding sources; equitable access by LDCs to funding for the implementation of NAPAs; criteria for supporting activities on an agreed full-cost basis, taking account of the level of funds available; guidelines for expedited support; urgency and immediacy of adapting to the adverse effects of climate change; and prioritization of activities. The COP also decides to assess progress made in implementing the decision and to consider the adoption of further guidance at COP-10."
