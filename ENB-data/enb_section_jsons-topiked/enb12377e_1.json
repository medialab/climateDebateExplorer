    "The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992.", 
    "The UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.", 
    "The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now has 192 parties.", 
    "In December 1997, delegates at the third Conference of the Parties (COP 3) in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission reduction targets.", 
    "These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I parties, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.", 
    "The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005, and now has 180 parties.", 
    "The first Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 1) in Montreal, Canada in 2005 established the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP).", 
    "In addition, COP 11 agreed to consider long-term cooperation under the UNFCCC without prejudice to any future negotiations, commitments, process, framework or mandate under the Convention through a series of four workshops constituting a Dialogue that would continue until COP 13 . COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 took place in December 2007, in Bali, Indonesia.", 
    "The focus of the Bali conference was on post-2012 issues, and negotiators spent much of their time seeking agreement on a two-year process, or Bali roadmap, to finalize a post-2012 regime by COP 15 in December 2009.", 
    "This roadmap sets out tracks under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol.", 
    "Under the Convention, negotiations on the follow up to the Convention Dialogue resulted in agreement on a Bali Action Plan that established the AWG-LCA, with a view to launching a comprehensive process on long-term cooperative action, to be completed in 2009.", 
    "The Bali Action Plan identifies four key elements: mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology.", 
    "The Plan also contains a non-exhaustive list of issues to be considered under each of these areas and calls for addressing a shared vision for long-term cooperative action.", 
    "The first session of the AWG-LCA and fifth session of the AWG-KP took place from 31 March to 4 April 2008, in Bangkok, Thailand.", 
    "The second session of the AWG-LCA 2 and the resumed fifth session of the AWG-KP took place from 2-12 June in Bonn, Germany.",
