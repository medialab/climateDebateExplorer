    "Consistent with the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities,' the content and timetable for submitting these reports - or 'national communications' - varies depending on whether the country is an 'Annex I' (industrialized countries and most economies in transition) or 'non-Annex I' (mostly developing countries) Party.", 
    "Due to their circumstances, the UNFCCC granted non-Annex I Parties a more flexible timetable for preparing and submitting their national communications.", 
    "Most non-Annex I Parties must submit their first national communications within three years of becoming Parties to the UNFCCC.", 
    "Although the least developed countries (LDCs) are entitled to make their initial communications 'at their discretion.", 
    "' Non-Annex I Parties are eligible for financial and technical assistance from the GEF for preparing these national communications.", 
    "In addition, other donors and agencies have also provided assistance. Building on the provisions in the UNFCCC, further work on non-Annex I Parties\u0092 national communications was completed at the second Conference of the Parties (COP-2) held in Geneva in July 1996.", 
    "At COP-2, delegates agreed on the substance that should be contained in national communications, and set out guidelines for such communications (decision 10/CP.2)."
