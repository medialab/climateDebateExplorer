    "Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to the world's environment, with negative impacts expected on human health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural resources, and physical infrastructure.", 
    "Global climate varies naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the Earth\u0092s atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate.", 
    "According to the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of climate change have already been observed.", 
    "Despite some lingering uncertainties, the majority of climate scientists believe that prompt and precautionary action is necessary. The international political response to climate change began with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).", 
    "Adopted in 1992, the UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid 'dangerous interference' with the climate system.", 
    "The greenhouse gases to be limited include methane, nitrous oxide, and, in particular, carbon dioxide.", 
    "The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994.", 
    "It currently has 188 Parties."
