    "Ministerial negotiations on President Pronk's Note took place throughout Friday and into Saturday.", 
    "However, after almost 36 hours of intense talks, negotiators did not achieve a breakthrough, and on Saturday afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk convened a final high-level informal Plenary in which he announced that delegates had failed to reach agreement. On 25 November, the reports and draft decision were addressed in the closing Plenary.", 
    "The COP took note of the Report of the Global Environment Facility to the COP (FCCC/SBI/2000/CRP.15), including the report on the review of the implementation of commitments and of other provisions of the UNFCCC (FCCC/CP/2000/3) and the report on the review of the GEF's climate change enabling activities (FCCC/CP/2000/3/Add.1), as well as the draft decision on Additional guidance to an operating entity of the financial mechanism (FCCC/CP/2000/CRP.8).", 
    "Since no agreement was reached on the draft conclusion, draft decision, reports, or 'crunch issues' outlined by President Pronk, the Plenary deferred decision to the resumed session of COP-6."
