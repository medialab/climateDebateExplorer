    "This question addressed climate fluctuations, extreme events and the risk of abrupt/non-linear changes. Views differed over how to characterize the nature, degree and likelihood of abrupt/non-linear changes in physical systems resulting from climate change, and the extent to which these may be irreversible.", 
    "Given the varying terminology used in the different working groups, delegates had difficulty merging material from the SPMs of Working Groups I and II.", 
    "A contact group was formed to consider this issue. On examples of projected abrupt/non-linear changes, participants discussed the implication of local warming over Greenland on global sea-level rise.", 
    "Agreement was reached on a sentence stating that 'ice sheet models project that a local warming of larger than 3\u00b0C, if sustained for millennia, would lead to virtually a complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a resulting sea- level rise of about 7m.", 
    "' Delegates also agreed to strengthen a reference to the effects of permafrost melting to say that landslides will affect water courses and wetland ecosystems, as well as infrastructure."
