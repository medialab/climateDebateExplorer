    "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2014/L.5), the SBSTA, inter alia : - welcomes the completion of TNAs by 31 countries, acknowledging financial support provided by the GEF under the Poznan Strategic Programme on technology transfer and technical support provided by UNEP and regional organizations; - recognizes that TNAs provide a wide range of information, and that this information could provide insight on the types of support needed; - invites parties, relevant international organizations, the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and other relevant financial institutions to provide technical and financial support to non-Annex I parties for the implementation of the results of their TNAs; - notes that the TNA process is meant to enhance action on mitigation and adaptation, and recognizes that project implementation benefits from a range of relevant elements; - encourages non-Annex I parties to take the outcomes of their TNAs into account when preparing their requests for support from the CTCN; and - acknowledges possible interlinkages between TNAs and other climate and development-related domestic processes, such as NAMAs and NAPs."
