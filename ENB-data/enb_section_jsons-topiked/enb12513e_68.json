    "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2011/L.10), the SBI welcomes the progress made in providing technical and financial support to assist 36 non-Annex I parties in developing and updating their TNAs, and recommends that COP 17 invite the GEF to continue to provide financial support to other non-Annex I parties to conduct or update their TNAs.", 
    "Further, noting that the pilot project proposals submitted by non-Annex I parties and supported by the GEF as part of the Poznan strategic programme on technology transfer included only one project on adaptation technologies, the SBI requests the GEF, parties and relevant organizations in a position to do so to provide financial support for project proposals related to adaptation technologies."
