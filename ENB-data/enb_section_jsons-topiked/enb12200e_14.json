    "The agenda item on reporting and review of greenhouse gas inventories from Annex I Parties was first addressed in SBSTA on Wednesday, 5 June.", 
    "It was then taken up in a contact group co-chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and Newton Paciornik (Brazil).", 
    "On Tuesday, 11 June, the group completed its work on draft conclusions, which were adopted by SBSTA on Thursday, 13 June. On Wednesday, 5 June, the Secretariat presented SBSTA with an overview of relevant recommendations and experiences of the technical review process (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/5; FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2).", 
    "He said the review process aimed to establish more complete and transparent guidelines and highlighted the need to: improve guidelines through a common reporting format; better define draft report objectives; incorporate a new concept of literature reviewers; and consider timing and length of the review process.", 
    "A contact group was formed to consider these issues. The contact group met on Thursday, 6 June, to consider a Co- Chairs\u0092 proposed draft working paper and annex (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2/Add.1-3), which incorporated EU and US technical proposals on the guidelines.", 
    "Agreement was reached on text relating to key source category determination, quality assurance/quality control and recalculations. On Friday, 7 June, Parties reconvened in the contact group to hear the Co-Chairs\u0092 revisions of text on reporting guidelines, the common reporting format (CRF) tables, and pending issues held over from Thursday.", 
    "On uncertainties for reporting, Canada said these should be quantified and reported, but not in the CRF, which compares data across Parties.", 
    "Peru recommended the inclusion of uncertainties, while the US said uncertainties should fall under national inventory reporting (NIR).", 
    "China opposed a US proposal that CRF tables contain key source categories, proposing that uncertainties cover all categories.", 
    "Co-Chair Rosland invited Parties to reach conclusions on pending issues by Saturday morning.", 
    "A sub-group met in the evening to consider the CRF tables (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2/Add.3), with differences again resurfacing on uncertainties for key sources. On Saturday, 8 June, discussion focused on the proposed structure of NIR, on when to use 'shall' or 'should' in the guidelines, and on how the guidelines will apply to Parties that choose 1995 as their baseline under Protocol Article 3.8 (base year for HFCs, PFCs, and SF6). On Monday, 10 June, the contact group met in afternoon and evening sessions, with delegates considering methodological issues addressed in the report of an expert meeting to assess experience of the use of the reporting and review guidelines (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2/Add.1). In the evening, Co-Chair Rosland reported that technical consultations had resolved several outstanding issues, such as source categories, and the CRF tables.", 
    "Parties then revisited the reporting guidelines and the methodological annex, with consultations continuing late into the night. On Tuesday, 11 June, the contact group completed its work.", 
    "Parties agreed to revisions to the draft working paper by the Co-Chairs, including on: issues under the general approach; scope of the initial check of annual inventories; synthesis and assessment report; timing; and review of individual annual inventories. On Thursday, 13 June, Co-Chair Paciornik introduced the draft conclusions to the SBSTA, which adopted them without amendment."
