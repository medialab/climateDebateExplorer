    "The COP recognizes that minimizing the impact of the implementation of Protocol Article 3.1 (quantitative emissions commitments) is a development concern affecting both developed and developing countries.", 
    "It recommends that the COP/MOP request Annex I Parties to provide information, as part of the necessary supplementary information to their annual inventory report, on how they are striving to implement commitments under Article 3.1 in such a way as to minimize adverse social, environmental and economic impacts on developing country Parties.", 
    "Priority should be given to the implementation of the following actions: progressive reduction or phasing out of market imperfections, fiscal incentives, tax and duty exemptions and subsidies in all greenhouse gas emitting sectors, taking into account the need for energy price reforms to reflect market prices and externalities; cooperation in the technological development of non-energy uses of fossil fuels, and support to developing country Parties to this end; and assistance to developing country Parties highly dependent on the export and consumption of fossil fuels in diversifying their economies."
