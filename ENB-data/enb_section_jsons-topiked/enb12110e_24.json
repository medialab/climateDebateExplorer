    "In an effort to encourage reflection on methods for making the intergovernmental process more effective and efficient, the Secretariat produced a document containing suggestions (FCCC/SBI/1999/2). On Tuesday, 1 June, Parties exchanged views on COP-5, including: when it should commence; whether a Committee of the Whole (COW) should be created; what form the high-level segment should take; and what dates for COP-6 could be.", 
    "Several Parties favored establishing a COW as it would benefit small delegations.", 
    "Stating that COP-5 will be largely a technical meeting, SAUDI ARABIA, with KAZAKHSTAN and CHINA, opposed the creation of a COW.", 
    "CANADA and SLOVENIA preferred the high-level segment but without formal oral presentations.", 
    "The EU suggested an informal panel discussion between ministers to enable them to focus on important political issues. EGYPT proposed grouping controversial issues into clusters and discussing them in workshops before COP-5.", 
    "SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA cautioned against introducing controversial issues that could 'torpedo' the success of COP-5.", 
    "The NETHERLANDS expressed interest in hosting COP-6.", 
    "Chair Kante requested the Rapporteur to consult with Parties and find common ground on these issues. On Monday, 7 June, SBI Rapporteur Klaus Radunsky outlined two alternative proposals on arrangements for COP-5 and noted that, while both scheduled the beginning of the session for 25 October 1999, one entailed a COW while the other excludes it.", 
    "He said options for the high-level segment were 1-2 November and 4-5 November.", 
    "On topics for the high-level segment, he stated that two options were being discussed.", 
    "The first proposed the high- level segment to address, inter alia: experiences; key issues; challenges with regard to innovative, efficient and state-of- the-art technologies; policies and measures; and the Protocol mechanisms, as well as ways and means of promoting their development.", 
    "The second proposed an exchange of views on the short- and long-term development of the Convention and the Protocol, including the implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. The G-77/CHINA tabled a draft decision on arrangements for COP- 5.", 
    "He indicated that, inter alia: no 'contentious' or 'extraneous' issues should be included in COP-5\u0092s agenda; no COW need be formed; the high-level segment should take place from 3- 4 November; and ministers and heads of delegation should participate on an equal footing.", 
    "He recommended that the high- level segment address the state of implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action and the early entry into force of the Protocol.", 
    "The EU called for dynamic interaction among heads of delegation during the high-level segment, rather than lengthy statements.", 
    "The EU, with the US, noted the need for more consultations on arrangements for COP-5.", 
    "JAPAN accepted most of the G-77/CHINA\u0092s suggestions, except on timing for the high- level segment.", 
    "He emphasized COP-5\u0092s role in building momentum towards COP-6. The NETHERLANDS announced its offer to host COP-6 in the Hague and said Parties should decide whether it should be held in 2000 or 2001.", 
    "The US noted its preference to hold COP-6 in 2001 in view of the work required to solve pending issues, including the Protocol mechanisms, compliance procedures and LULUCF.", 
    "He proposed two sessions of the subsidiary bodies to take place between COP-5 and COP-6.", 
    "AUSTRALIA said that since COP-6 had important decisions to take it should be held early in 2001.", 
    "CANADA noted the importance of setting the technical foundation of decisions on issues such as technology transfer, the mechanisms and compliance.", 
    "He said there should be ample opportunities for subsidiary body discussions in 2000, which may affect the dates for COP-6.", 
    "The G-77/CHINA preferred scheduling COP-6 in October or November 2000, and objected to additional intersessional meetings of the subsidiary bodies.", 
    "The EU expressed its flexibility on the timing of COP-6 but underscored the need for a prompt decision to give the Netherlands sufficient time to prepare.", 
    "Chair Kante asked John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) to undertake informal consultations and report back to the SBI. In SBI\u0092s closing plenary session on Friday, 11 June, conclusions (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP.3) were adopted that: welcomed the nomination of Mr. Jan Szyszko, Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources and Forestry of Poland, by the Group of Eastern European States as President designate of COP-5; recommended that COP-5 begin on 25 October 1999; made arrangements for the high-level segment; welcomed the offer of the Netherlands to host COP-6; and recommended dates for meetings of the subsidiary bodies for the year 2001-2003.", 
    "The SBI recommended that the COP-5 high-level segment take place on 2-3 November 1999 and the discussion topics be: lessons learned and progress made in dealing with climate change, and promoting implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action and entry into force of the Protocol.", 
    "The SBI decided to defer discussion on dates for COP-6 and dates for the sessions of the subsidiary bodies in 2000, to its eleventh session."
