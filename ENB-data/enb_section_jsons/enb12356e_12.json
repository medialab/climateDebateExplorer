      "Albert Binger, Caribbean Community Climate Change Center (CCCCC), described environmental and socioeconomic characteristics of the agricultural sector in the Caribbean.",
      "He noted the agricultural sector is in decline and affected negatively by climate change, and discussed volatility of markets and trade impacts in the region.",
      "He said the region was most vulnerable due to impacts on food security and dependence on trade.",
      "He stressed that in adapting regional agriculture to climate change, the following, inter alia, are needed: identification of consumption patterns; improved water management, including managing watersheds; better integration of sectoral plans; addressing conversion of agricultural lands; increased research and development capacity; more synergies with other sectors, such as water and housing; and less dependence on sugar and energy inputs."
