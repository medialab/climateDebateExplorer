      "On Tuesday, 13 June, delegates heard a report from the Secretariat on proposals to advance the implementation of FCCC Article 6 (education, training and public awareness).",
      "The Central African Republic, with others, advocated that Article 6 be a separate SBSTA agenda item.",
      "The G-77/China undertook to provide SBSTA with consolidated text on this issue on 14 June. SBSTA adopted conclusions on this issue (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/CRP.6) on Friday, 16 June, in which it: notes with appreciation that the issue of education, training and public awareness had been taken up at the current session; notes that the issue has so far received little attention from SBSTA, and that any lessons learned by Parties, intergovernmental organizations and NGOs should be compiled and shared; and requests the Secretariat to place Article 6 on the agenda of SBSTA-14 and, where appropriate, subsequent sessions."
