      "Albert Fischer, Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, presented the group s recommendations.",
      "Regarding data and information exchange, which is necessary at all levels, he identified, as impediments, the fact that mandates of institutions that hold data are not necessarily aligned with the needs of users, and that some data is privately held.",
      "He said the group recommends providing high-level political impetus to improve exchange through: development of a legal framework for exchanging data and information, as current national regulations often act as barriers to exchange; using regional centers to overcome barriers; using partner organizations to leverage accessibility to data; providing free access to data needed under the Convention and, under the NWP, identifying essential data needs and barriers to dissemination; identifying agencies to take the lead in addressing these barriers; ensuring stakeholders needs are identified; identifying costs of free exchange ; and ensuring data is user friendly and accessible to non-experts.",
      "Regarding promoting partnerships between data users and providers, he stressed: partnerships with meteorological services and other data holders, and among agencies that hold data; and highlighting, under the NWP, countries with best practices.",
      "Regarding identification of data and information and sustained observations needed for impacts/vulnerability and adaptation work, he stressed: the need to identify data and observations valuable to the objectives of the NWP; the need for a strong link with the methods and tools used, in order to build an adaptation framework; close consultations with users of data; and the fact that needs are often sectoral and regional, which acts as an impediment to sustained and coordinated observations.",
      "He said recommendations regarding identification of data included: defining the essential variables (climate, ecosystems, economic and social), specifically for impacts, vulnerability and adaptation, through: a process of consultation with providers and users of data; possibly an adequacy report; and a compendium of data providers, linked to the compendium on methods and tools; a regular process to monitor flow of data/information and identify impediments; improving communications between providers and users; and establishing standards for observations and data exchange.",
      "Regarding awareness of available data, the group recommended highlighting data, information and tools for access that are already available, and establishing a forum to share user experiences to promote learning about data and information, how it is used and applied, and possibly providing data electronically or through knowledge markets."
