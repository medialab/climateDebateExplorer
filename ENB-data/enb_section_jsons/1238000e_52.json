      "The Second Conference of the Parties (COP-2) to the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) sent out a number of important political signals as the COP continues toward the goal of strengthening the commitments on the part of industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beyond the year 2000.",
      "COP-2, marking the mid-point in the schedule for the fulfillment of the Berlin Mandate, 'noted' a strong Ministerial Declaration confirming the findings of the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) and calling for 'legally binding' commitments.",
      "COP-2 also convened a Ministerial Round Table, which endorsed the points in the Declaration.",
      "In a dramatic change of position, the US announced support for a legally binding protocol or other legal instrument. Nonetheless, many longstanding disagreements on fundamental issues appeared to solidify, both in the subsidiary bodies and the COP.",
      "For example, delegates could not agree on references to the SAR or on the election of officers, leaving the COP to again 'apply' rather than 'adopt' the rules of procedure.",
      "Also, the US support for a protocol was linked to a preference for a tradeable permit system, raising many new complexities for delegations.",
      "These signals - both positive and negative - indicate that many obstacles await future negotiations."
