      "In its conclusions ( FCCC/SBI/2009/L.12 ), the SBI takes note of the information on financial support provided by the GEF Secretariat for preparing non-Annex I national communications ; and invites the GEF to continue providing such information, ensuring that it is detailed, accurate, timely and complete.",
      "The SBI also, inter alia : encourages non-Annex I parties that have already received funding to submit their second or third national communications; reiterates the request to the GEF to assist non-Annex I parties in formulating and developing project proposals and to report on such submitted or approved projects to COP 15; takes note of the GEF proposal to reallocate funds from its fourth replenishment, and urges the GEF to ensure, as a top priority, that sufficient financial resources are provided to meet the agreed full costs incurred by developing countries; and notes concerns expressed that funding provided for national communications through the expedited procedures may not be adequate for some non-Annex I parties."
