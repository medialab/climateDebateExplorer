      "Discussion took place on changes in annual mean precipitation under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario, one of the four scenarios used in the AR5 as explained in Box SPM.1.",
      "Sweden and the UK asked why only the RCP8.5 scenario was used, with the CLAs responding that changes in internal natural variability may not be as significant, and likelihood statements cannot be made for other scenarios.",
      "On extreme precipitation events over mid-latitude landmass and wet tropical regions becoming more intense and frequent, the CLAs clarified that the assessment was based on more than the RCPs, and that the conclusion was generally true for all these regions.",
      "Noting more frequent and extreme rainfall in the Sahel, Mali asked why dry regions were not mentioned, to which the CLAs responded that, because of natural variability, the same statement could not be made for dry regions."
