      "The International Energy Agency (IEA) held an international workshop from 15-16 April 1999 in Paris to exchange the experiences of Member countries in the design and implementation of policies and measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy.",
      "The workshop\u0092s key messages include: * while policy responses may differ based on national circumstances, the challenges remain the same across countries, in particular in the energy sector.",
      "Countries can benefit from information exchange on policies and measures; * the gap between the present situation and Kyoto objectives requires new domestic policies and measures in the energy sector to achieve the agreed emissions reduction goals; * the distinction between economic instruments and regulatory approaches is artificial.",
      "Both types of policies are needed; * the implementation of economic instruments such as taxes requires accompanying measures to account for social and competitiveness concerns; and, * CO2 emissions from transport are growing rapidly and few policies seem to have had significant impacts on this trend so far.",
      "Policies to reduce emissions from transport should aim at changing behavior as well as changing technology. For more information contact: IEA; e-mail: info@iea.org; Internet: http://www.iea.org/workshop/p&magend.htm."
