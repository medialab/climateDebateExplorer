      "Discussions in this contact group focused on the question of establishing a permanent forum or use existing channels, including national communications.",

      "He said some information could come from national communications but that a forum would also utilize information from other documents and reports. NEW ZEALAND and the EU said this might duplicate the work of the SBI in reviewing national communications.",

      "Noting proposals for new forums on potential consequences under the SBI, SBSTA and AWG-LCA, the EU and NEW ZEALAND recommended joint discussions to ensure language in the texts is not contradictory.",
      "The EU suggested that developed countries face a dilemma, because it is unclear what the consequences of their policies are on developing countries.",
      "He noted that information needs to come from both developing and developed countries, and said the issue should be addressed under SBI and SBSTA."
