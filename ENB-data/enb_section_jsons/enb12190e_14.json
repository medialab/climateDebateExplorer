      "Mahendra Kumar, Associate Professor of Physics, School of Pure & Applied Sciences at the University of the South Pacific, remarked on the problems and constraints Fiji is encountering while preparing its first national communication.",
      "On institutional constraints, he explained that awareness among decision makers is weak, guidance from outside experts is limited and support for the national climate change coordinator is insufficient.",
      "On human resource constraints, he noted a lack of qualified personnel, inadequate training opportunities, and high turnover.",
      "On financial constraints, he remarked on insufficient funds for hiring external consultants and for providing a financial incentive for climate change team members to complete their work.",
      "He said technical constraints include lack of data or access to data, and lack of appropriate methodology for V&A.",
      "Problems unique to Fiji include the year-long political crisis that began in May 2000, the bureaucracy\u0092s lengthy approval process for hiring outside consultants, the low status of the climate change coordinator within the bureaucracy, and the government\u0092s treatment of climate change as a stand-alone issue."
