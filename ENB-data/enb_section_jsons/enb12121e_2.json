      "During the afternoon session, delegates exchanged views on the way forward in relation to promoting implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) and the early entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. On outcomes from COP-5, the UK, supported by KAZAKHSTAN and the US, and opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed a Bonn Declaration reaffirming the political will to complete the BAPA by COP-6.",
      "KUWAIT said the proposal for a Bonn Declaration was premature. On preparations for COP-6, many Parties called for intensified efforts and for the role of the President to be strengthened in order to achieve success on the BAPA at COP-6.",
      "ARGENTINA, supported by FINLAND and BENIN, said innovative approaches were needed and called for the establishment of small task forces in the run-up to COP-6.",
      "She said traditional groupings among countries to develop common positions may no longer be appropriate. JAPAN, supported by KAZAKHSTAN, BOTSWANA, the US, CANADA, BENIN, ICELAND, HONDURAS and SOUTH AFRICA, suggested that COP-5 President Szyszko (Poland) be empowered to appoint a special facilitator to assist negotiations and help Parties realize the BAPA by COP-6. AUSTRALIA proposed the establishment of a Committee of the Whole (COW) chaired by a facilitator vested with the requisite authority by the COP-5 President.",
      "The US said it could support this, but that a COW should not substitute for Japan's proposal for a facilitator.",
      "BELGIUM supported a flexible approach focused on achieving successful outcomes and said a COW or another new structure should be transparent and monitored by all Parties. CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA, VENEZUELA, KUWAIT, INDONESIA, and LIBYA, opposed the proposals to establish new groups or mechanisms to assist progress toward COP-6, stressing that the existing FCCC bodies and structures should be employed to this end.",
      "CHINA, supported by KUWAIT and others, said a facilitator would not be able to visit and confer with all Parties.",
      "Several Parties said any new mechanism or group should operate in a transparent and accountable manner.",
      "NORWAY said ministers should be engaged in the process between the COPs. Other issues highlighted by Parties included: implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects); the framework and rules for CDM and other mechanisms; the need for domestic action; the supplementarity of the mechanisms; capacity building; voluntary commitments; AIJ; and ratification of the Protocol."
