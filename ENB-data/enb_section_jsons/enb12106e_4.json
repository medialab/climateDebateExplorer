      "The contact group on Annex I communications convened in afternoon and evening sessions to consider the following documents: the draft decision on guidelines and the schedule for Annex I communications; draft SBSTA and SBI conclusions on Annex I communications guidelines; draft guidelines on inventories; and notes on the common reporting format (CRF). Regarding the draft decision on guidelines and the schedule, the group accepted a number of amendments, including, inter alia: a preambular sentence proposed by Switzerland noting the ongoing process of improvement in reporting guidance to Parties, particularly through the IPCC\u0092s work on uncertainties and good practice in managing inventories; and the EU\u0092s insertion of 'annual' inventory reporting.",
      "The group accepted an amended draft of the SBSTA and SBI conclusions on guidelines for Annex I communications.",
      "On the draft guidelines on inventories, the group concluded its discussion after accepting several amendments, including, inter alia: deleting a paragraph with definitions of the terms 'shall' and 'should;' and inserting a sentence noting that the CRF is part of the national inventory report.",
      "In its evening session, the group accepted the notes on the CRF as amended."
