      "On COP/MOP, Co-Chair Slade said the proposals reflected the degree of political intervention Parties would allow in the compliance process.",
      "NEW ZEALAND and the EU said the COP/MOP was the central policy-making body, but should not directly intervene in a specific case by taking over the judicial/legal body's functions.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA stressed the COP/MOP's central role and said it would not only accept the report of the compliance body, but could also modify that body's decisions.",
      "CANADA, with NEW ZEALAND, said this would politicize the process and that the legal appreciation should be left to the compliance body.",
      "AUSTRALIA said the COP/MOP could have a final say on manifestly unjust decisions. On China's proposal to include a new section on the implications of Article 18 (non-compliance), the US said an amendment would be needed if binding consequences were to be adopted as part of the compliance system.",
      "CHINA cautioned against creating two groups of Parties that had ratified the Protocol: one group with, and the other without, the compliance procedure.",
