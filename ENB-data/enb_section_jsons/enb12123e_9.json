      "COP-4 President Maria Julia Alsogaray (Argentina) opened COP-5 on Monday, 25 October 1999, and emphasized the need for political will to fulfill the BAPA and allow for the Protocol to enter into force by Rio+10 in 2002. Jan Szyszko, Poland's Minister of Environmental Protection, Natural Resources and Forestry, was then elected President of COP- 5.",
      "He said the operation of the Protocol mechanisms, compliance, and guidance to COP/MOP-1 should be resolved by COP-6.",

German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der noted that, despite the establishment of the FCCC, there have been setbacks in the climate process, including the inability of most industrialized countries to reduce their CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.",
      "He said the Protocol should enter into force in time for Rio+10 in 2002 and urged Parties to implement their pledges in international fora. FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar, on behalf of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, stressed the need for urgent action if the Kyoto commitments are to be met.",
