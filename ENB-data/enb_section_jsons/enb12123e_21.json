      "On Tuesday, 26 October, a joint SBI/SBSTA session considered matters related to FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects). Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) reported on a workshop on implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 held from 21-24 September 1999 in Bonn.",
      "Many delegates said the workshop was a useful exercise.",
      "The G-77/CHINA said it had highlighted the need for another workshop prior to COP-6. Regarding information gaps on adverse effects, the MARSHALL ISLANDS called for more robust research on policies and measures in Annex I countries.",
      "AUSTRALIA, with CANADA and the GAMBIA, said the absence of information on the effect of policies and measures should not be an obstacle to meeting the needs of the truly vulnerable.",
      "SENEGAL called for evaluation of vulnerability in Africa by COP-6. On the impact of response measures on the economies of oil producing and other countries, SAUDI ARABIA referred to recent studies suggesting oil producing countries will suffer economically from response measures and, with KUWAIT and LIBYA, said developed countries should remove market distortions in the energy sector.",
      "The US said there was uncertainty over the impact of implementation of response measures.",
      "JAPAN and the MARSHALL ISLANDS said consideration of compensation was unacceptable, since it is not provided for in the FCCC or the Protocol.",
      "A contact group co-chaired by Bo Kj\u00e9llen (Sweden) and Mohammad Reza Salamat (Iran) was convened on this issue.",
      "The group met several times from 27 October to 4 November. Co-Chair Salamat presented the Co-Chairs' draft decision on Saturday, 30 October, and on Tuesday, 2 November, the group considered the draft text.",
      "Divergence of views focused on: whether to 'establish' or 'continue' a process for the further implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9; what the process was about; whether it should be assessed by the Parties 'annually,' 'periodically,' 'on a 'regular basis' or 'by COP-6 and subsequent COPs, as appropriate;' whether there should be one or two workshops in 2000; and what topics the workshop[s] should address.",
      "A proposal requesting Annex I Parties to report on initial actions undertaken to implement FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 was discussed.",
      "Some delegates considered that non-Annex I Parties should also be requested to report on these actions. The COP adopted the a draft decision on FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14 (FCCC/CP/1999/L.22) on Thursday, 4 November.",
      "The decision recognizes that the identification of initial actions necessary to address the adverse effects of climate change and/or the impact of the implementation of response measures needs to be based on sufficient information and analysis within a clearly defined process.",
      "The COP decided that the process of implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9, as established by decisions 3/CP.3 and 5/CP.4, should, inter alia, continue and gather information on initial actions needed to address the specific needs and concerns of developing countries and LDCs arising from climate change and/or the impact of the implementation of response measures, as well as identify what actions are necessary under the Convention relating to funding, insurance and transfer of technology to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing countries and LDCs.",
      "It further decides that SB-12 shall continue consideration of the implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9, including consideration of the extent of developing countries' efforts to diversify their national economies and of how the international community could best support such efforts.",
      "The COP decided to organize two workshops under the guidance of the SB Chairs: one on the consideration of initial actions needed to meet developing countries' and LDCs' specific needs and concerns arising from the adverse effects of climate change; and another workshop on the methodological approaches and actions that are necessary to address the impact of the implementation of response measures on, inter alia, terms of trade, international capital flows and development efforts.",
      "The two workshops shall be organized in two consecutive but equal time periods, before 31 March 2000."
