      "In the ensuing discussion, Michael Gerbis responded to a question about the impact of the recent economic difficulties in Argentina on the Canada-Argentina initiative, noting that stakeholders had agreed to proceed with the project regardless, since it presented an opportunity to improve efficiency. Noting the discussion on the CDM and JI, one developing country speaker stressed that technology transfer under the CDM should be additional to the technology transfer that takes place under Article 4.5.",
      "In response, Gerbis acknowledged that the issue of additionality is a 'gray area,' but noted that the CDM can be used to support technology transfer and ultimately help move forward on implementing Article 4.5."
