      "The contact group on capacity building in developing countries met to consider the draft decision on capacity building in developing countries and the annexed framework for capacity building.",
      "Co-Chair Uosukainen introduced the revised text resulting from 'informal informal' consultations in the Friends of the Chairs' group.",
      "He said that the paragraphs addressing financial provisions have been deferred to the contact group on the financial mechanism.",
      "Delegates then considered the paragraphs containing bracketed text and agreed to remove a number of the brackets. On the operational paragraph containing the purpose of the framework, delegates agreed that the framework 'should' guide capacity-building activities related to the implementation of the UNFCCC.",
      "They also decided to delete a paragraph deciding to review the framework after eight years and removed brackets from language inviting Parties to provide information through national communications to enable the SBI to monitor progress on the implementation of the framework.",
      "They also agreed to recommend COP/MOP-1 to adopt a decision containing a framework for capacity building that reaffirms this framework with additional reference to priority areas for capacity building relating to the implementation of the Protocol. In the scope for capacity building outlined in the annexed framework, delegates debated and failed to remove brackets from language on 'strengthening the capacity relating to' 'implementation' of adaptation response measures.",
      "They also did not agree on reference to developing national adaptation programmes of action, with the US stating that this was under consideration in the contact group on adverse effects.",
      "On financing and operation, divergence remained over whether financial and technical resources should be made available through an operating entity of the financial mechanism and 'as appropriate,' multilateral and bilateral agencies."
