      "AGBM Chair Ra\u00fal Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) invited the chairs of the non-groups to report on their progress. Bo Kj\u00e9llen (Sweden) reported on the QELROs non-groups.",
      "He said delegates in the non-group chaired by Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil) supported a revised Article 3(1) that sets out the legally binding nature of commitments.",
      "Sinks were a key emerging issue and further consultations are forthcoming.",
      "The group decided that the non-group on institutions and mechanisms should address issues concerning the legal status of Attachment 1, which would list differentiated commitments.",
      "Regarding Annex C (process for establishing differentiated commitments), Parties supporting differentiation will engage in informal consultations. Articles 3(3), specifying which Parties are committed, and 3(5), requiring demonstrable progress by 2005, are still under consideration.",
      "Discussions on Article 3(6) - 3(12) have been deferred, pending further discussions on emissions budgets.",
      "Article 3(16) has been deferred until Parties determine which gases to include.",
      "He said the AGBM Chair requested SBTSA's assistance on methodologies and a draft decision has been circulated.",
      "Delegates disagreed over Global Warming Potentials (GWPs), and a contact group will consider the issue. On the second non-group, chaired by Kj\u00e9llen, he reported broad agreement and a new text on 3(4) (countries with economies in transition).",
      "On 3(13) and 3(14)(crediting), amendments were suggested and further consideration will await discussions on emissions budgets.",
      "On Articles 5 (emissions trading) and 6 (joint implementation), Kj\u00e9llen reported wide differences of opinion.",
      "Informal consultations were held on Saturday but some key delegations did not participate.",
      "The Chair will produce a revised text based on written submissions. He said both QELROs groups have advanced slowly, but there has been a useful exchange of views.",
      "He said that on many issues the positions of some Parties are still far apart and there is no evidence of emerging consensus.",
      "The agenda for both segments is considerable and a number of things must still be addressed, such as compliance and voluntary commitments.",
      "He cautioned delegates to realize that all elements are linked, and the purpose of this meeting is to intensify the effort towards consensus. Evans King (Trinidad and Tobago), Chair of the non-group on advancing the commitments in FCCC Article 4.1 (Article 12 in the draft negotiating text), reported that delegates had reached agreement on the chapeau, but have not discussed all the sub-paragraphs.",
      "Discussions have proven that views are divergent and delegates have not reached consensus.",
      "A paragraph on implementation information will be set aside pending resolution of related matters.",
      "On Article 13 (financial mechanism), he said delegates had exchanged views and he is undertaking bilateral consultations. Bakary Kante (Senegal), Chair of the non-group on policies and measures (P&Ms), reported that the non-group had addressed nearly all paragraphs contained in Article 2 and Annex A of the negotiating text.",
      "He said 'last minute' formulations had prevented consensus on a paragraph requiring the adoption of P&Ms.",
      "The text currently contains bracketed language under which Parties would adopt and implement P&Ms towards the achievement of commitments of QELROs.",
      "Alternative texts have been proposed both by the EU and by the G-77 regarding a paragraph on minimizing the adverse effects of P&Ms.",
      "A paragraph on sharing experiences contains bracketed language on the development of common methodologies.",
      "The EU said it could work with text proposed by the G-77/China. The AGBM Chair, for the Chair of the non-group on institutions and mechanisms, reported that discussions had begun on the preamble, but further consultations were needed.",
      "Regarding definitions, the Secretariat will compile a list of terms from the agreed text that need to be defined.",
      "Article 14 contains alternative texts on establishing a Meeting of the Parties (MOP) or having the FCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) serve as the supreme body.",
      "Delegates worked on the COP text and the Chair has produced a revised text that takes into account views of those who favored the MOP approach.",
      "The non-group has discussed Articles 15 - 19, but has yet to consider Articles 20 - 26. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested that Parties find agreement on the quantitative parameters of the protocol, expanding the 'bubble' concept to all Annex I Parties in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.",
      "The commitments of individual Parties in the bubble could be based on the proposed targets put forward by those Parties.",
      "By 2010, an annual average reduction of some 3% could be achieved.",
      "Commitments should be achieved in absolute numbers rather than in percentage terms.",
      "He suggested that any attempt to apply a single criterion could give rise to a desire by some Parties to be taken out of Annex I. The UK, commenting on the Russian proposal, said that the EU proposal for a 15% reduction in emissions was not unilateral but dependent on similar efforts by others.",
      "He conveyed a number of points from a Commonwealth Heads of Government communiqu\u00e9: the importance of a successful outcome in Kyoto; a call on Parties at the COP to recognize that all countries would need to play a part in pursuing emissions reductions after Kyoto; and a call for monitoring of commitments. SAMOA, for AOSIS, said that US President Clinton\u0092s announcement did not provide the leadership expected from the world\u0092s wealthiest nation.",
      "The US commitment was not a new commitment but an attempt to delay the achievement of a goal that COP-1 had decided was inadequate.",
      "Climate change risks demand action on the basis of the precautionary principle not the wait-and-see approach.",
      "He urged President Clinton not to defer responsibility for the duration of some three presidential terms.",
      "EGYPT called for the preparation of a unified text, indicating points of agreement and disagreement, to take to the capitals Friday. The EU, welcomed the fact that the US and Japan shared its concerns and recognized the potential to reduce GHGs through cost-effective domestic action, but added that this was not properly reflected in the proposed targets.",
      "The US figures were lower than Japan\u0092s already insufficient targets.",
      "Serious negotiations would be needed if Kyoto is to produce the outcome the world needs.",
      "The EU will seek intensive dialogue with all Parties. The US described its proposal as aggressive and pointed out that some other proposals do not check the growth of trace gases nor protect forests and soil sinks.",
      "The proposal was fully compatible with long-term concentration targets that have been put forward by other Parties, i.e.",
      "550 ppmv.",
      "Avoiding such concentrations would depend more on developing countries' responses.",
      "No other Party was ready to implement its domestic program so expeditiously, leading others to propose unrealistic targets that fail to address HFCs, PFCs and SF6.",
      "The US had also provided the most detailed proposals for compliance.",
      "Promptly beginning the process of agreeing on developing country commitments would help them avoid the emissions-intensive path pursued by the industrialized world."
