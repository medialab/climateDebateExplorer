      "'This Seminar\u0085 is the first of its kind in UNFCCC history.",
      "[But] time will tell if it will be remembered as an historic event,' observed UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter at the opening of the Seminar of Governmental Experts on Monday morning, 16 May.",
      "Waller-Hunter\u0092s comments reflected the sentiments of the participants as the meeting began.",
      "Many were unsure of exactly what to expect from the Seminar.",
      "This uncertainty was due in large part to the importance and sensitivity of the issues many participants hoped to discuss. The decision to hold the Seminar was taken at COP-10 in December 2004, following heated discussions on how to engage on some of the broader issues facing the climate change process.",
      "Foremost among these issues for some Parties was the future framework and commitments to combat climate change in the post-2012 period.",
      "Developing countries were sensitive to attempts to discuss emissions targets for non-Annex I Parties, and there was also the difficult question of how to include non-Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in talks on subsequent commitments.",
      "In addition, there was interest in other issues, such as the increasingly strong evidence of climate change, differences of opinion over Kyoto\u0092s future, and mitigation and adaptation.",
      "As a result of these concerns and sensitivities, the terms of reference set for the Seminar were left both broad and, in some countries\u0092 opinions, quite vague."
