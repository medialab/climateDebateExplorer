      "A table containing information on key impacts on regions was initially discussed in plenary on Monday evening, together with draft table SPM-1.",
      "The draft table expressed impacts as a function of increasing global average temperature, and its structure was parallel to that of Table SPM-1, with three boxes: one on impacts including sub-boxes for regions; and the other two identical to the proposed SRES and stabilization scenarios boxes in draft table SPM-1.",
      "In plenary, Saudi Arabia noted the existence of many caveats to the table.",
      "The discussion began in the contact group on Thursday after 8:00 pm, and focused on Africa for two hours.",
      "Saudi Arabia, US, Brazil and others, opposed by Italy and France, noted lack of time to continue consideration of the regional table.",
      "In plenary on Friday morning, WGII agreed to remove the table from the SPM.",
      "Burning embers diagram: A diagram on causes of concern, similar to the one included in the TAR Synthesis Report was first introduced during the Wednesday morning contact group on impact tables, following requests in plenary by Germany, Austria and Spain.",
      "Switzerland said the diagram was too vague.",
      "Italy supported its inclusion noting that it is a TAR figure familiar to policymaker.",
      "The US requested time to consider the diagram and proposed its inclusion in the AR4 Synthesis Report instead.",
      "Spain noted the different audiences of the Synthesis Report and SPM and advocated keeping the diagram in the SPM.",
      "On Thursday WGII agreed not to include the diagram."
