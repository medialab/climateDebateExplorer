      "On 9 June, Chair Dovland introduced text for possible draft SBSTA-12 conclusions and preliminary elements of a draft decision for COP-6 based on recent discussions and submissions by Parties.",
      "The draft conclusions included a SBSTA recommendation that work on sharing experiences and information continue, in particular through a workshop in 2001.",
      "The draft decision stated, inter alia, that this process should lead to a further elaboration of the guidelines under Article 7.2 (national communications) and enable a demonstration of progress by 2005, in the context of Article 3.2 (demonstrable progress). The EU supported moving forward by exchanging views on both texts.",
      "Noting the lack of time to consider this matter, the G-77/CHINA objected to consideration of elements of a draft decision.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA added that it was premature to consider a decision before holding another workshop involving more developing countries, and highlighted other pressing issues in the lead-up to COP-6.",
      "He said it would be more appropriate to consider conclusions that expressed appreciation for the recent workshop in Copenhagen and called for another workshop in 2001. Chair Dovland said SBSTA-12 would consider this issue, and noted agreement on a workshop in 2001.",
      "AOSIS said it looked forward to extensive discussion on this matter during SBSTA-12."
