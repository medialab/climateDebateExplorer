      "Delegates commented on the Co-Chairs' draft proposals presenting three options for the adoption of procedures and mechanisms on compliance.",
      "The G-77/CHINA, supported by several members of its group, said it was premature to decide on one option since the mode of adoption depends on the content of the procedures and mechanisms.",
      "However, she added that there was clearly a need for legally-binding consequences and that consequently Protocol Article 18, which refers to an amendment, would need to be taken into account.",
      "JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, opposed by the US and CANADA, supported adoption by a decision.",
      "SWITZERLAND and NEW ZEALAND said adoption should be through a COP- 6 decision adopting an agreement becoming an integral part of the Protocol, while the EU favored the option whereby the agreement would be adopted at COP-7. On consequences of the enforcement branch, NEW ZEALAND, opposed by BRAZIL and INDIA, suggested new text on the issuance of assigned amounts under Article 3.3 and 3.4.",
      "On the consequences of the facilitative branch, the G-77/CHINA rejected an EU proposal that does not differentiate between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties.",
      "On appeal, delegates made preliminary comments on a Co-Chairs' proposal providing for the possibility of an appeal to the COP/MOP.",
      "The G-77/CHINA favored a narrow scope such as issues of due process and Article 3.1.",
      "A number of delegations said they needed more time to consider the proposal."
