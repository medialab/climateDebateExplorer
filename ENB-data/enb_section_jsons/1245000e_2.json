      "On 5 March, the Chair opened the second meeting of AGBM-6 by stating that this meeting is not intended for negotiating but for refining and consolidating similar proposals contained in the Framework Compilation of Proposals (FCCC/AGBM/1997/2 and Add.1) to set out clear alternatives for negotiation at AGBM-7. Annex I Expert Group Chair Ian Pickard (UK) reported on studies, carried out in cooperation with OECD and IEA, on carbon and energy taxation, P&Ms to encourage innovation in transport and technology and international greenhouse gas emissions trading.",
      "Document FCCC/AGBM/1997/Misc.2 contains an executive summary of these studies. The Chair called on the AGBM to consider the submissions on general commitments and guiding objectives for P&Ms.",
      "SAMOA called for a coordination mechanism to assist Annex I Parties in implementing their commitments, as proposed in the protocol submitted by the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).",
      "The mechanism would provide advice on a full range of measures including taxes and subsidies and would report regularly to the 'Meeting of the Parties.",
      "' The mechanism would be multi-disciplinary and open to participation by all Parties, government representatives, NGOs and scientists with relevant expertise.",
      "SAMOA also noted the need to avoid duplication of tasks, but expressed concern that existing subsidiary bodies may not be appropriately equipped to address technical issues. SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA said the comments from Parties contained in document FCCC/AGBM/1997/2/Add.1 should be included in the Framework Compilation.",
      "CHINA also expressed confusion regarding references to Annexes X, A and B in the proposals and urged Parties to refrain from developing new categories.",
      "JAPAN suggested that Annex I Parties adopt P&Ms according to national circumstances, in the areas of efficient use of energy, low-carbon energy, technological development and cooperation, and enhancement of sinks.",
      "The 'Meeting of the Parties' shall decide on indicators for P&Ms. The EU, supported by SWITZERLAND, favored legally-binding P&Ms and highlighted its proposed Annex A (common P&Ms), Annex B (coordinated P&Ms that receive high priority) and Annex C (priority P&Ms for inclusion in national programmes).",
      "The EU proposal contains P&Ms on: renewable energies; energy efficiency standards; labelling and other product-related measures; transport sector; economic instruments; energy policies; industry sector emissions; agriculture sector; forestry; and fluorocarbons.",
      "Several delegations commented on the EU proposal and some noted alternative approaches and priorities.",
      "POLAND and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION supported a menu approach, which takes account of various economic structures and attempts to maintain a high and stable rate of economic growth.",
      "The G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, stressed that P&Ms should not have adverse impacts on developing country Parties.",
      "He also expressed concern about new annexes that would impose new commitments on non-Annex I Parties.",
      "The EU reiterated that its proposal provides flexibility through Annex B, which lists P&Ms to be applied according to national circumstances. The US and SAUDI ARABIA did not support inclusion of specific P&Ms.",
      "The US also noted that sound information is not available for controlling greenhouse gases not listed in the proposed Annex C and suggested elaborating on P&Ms under the section on reporting.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA also warned that P&Ms undertaken by Annex I countries could negatively affect trade with developing countries.",
      "IRAN stressed the need for a section on general commitments and guiding measures in the protocol. The EU clarified that energy efficiency, standards and labelling, as well as P&Ms related to fluorocarbons, should be the highest priority.",
      "He also noted that paragraphs proposed by a number of Parties, including Norway, Iceland, New Zealand and Switzerland, could be integrated into the EU proposal.",
      "He said some developed countries, particularly the US, have not included binding measures in their proposals and emphasized the EU's conviction that P&Ms should be included to fully encompass the Berlin Mandate and the Geneva Declaration. CHINA reiterated that the Berlin Mandate requires an elaboration of P&Ms whose objectives should be clear at this stage.",
      "He said the EU proposal is too complicated and supported a proposal by the Chair to use three 'groups' rather than annexes on objectives, common but coordinated P&Ms and national P&Ms.",
      "The US also cautioned against including too many details and cited a number of examples illustrating the difficulties of proposed P&Ms related to specific products. The EU did not support the groupings proposed by the Chair and noted they were difficult to distinguish.",
      "He said objectives should not be separated from mechanisms and measures, and proposed listing all of them in Annex A.",
      "He also said that relevant details related to specific products must be considered because they are traded in the international market and an international agreement is needed to ensure results. The EU also reported that the EU Council had reached a common position on QELROs.",
      "The EU proposed that Parties to the Berlin Mandate will reduce emission levels for carbon dioxide (C02), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) by 15% by 2010 with a reference year of 1990.",
      "The EU also proposed an interim target for 2005. The Chair also requested delegates to consider a proposal regarding countries with economies in transition who are requesting a specific annex because of their particular circumstances.",
      "The EU did not support a separate annex and noted that the concerns of these countries could be addressed elsewhere, such as in an introductory section.",
      "The Chair, supported by IRAN, said these concerns are better addressed when considering QELROs. On 6 March, the Chair presented his draft conclusions on P&Ms, which represent a streamlined version of Section II of the Framework Compilation on strengthening the commitments in Article 4.2 (a) and (b).",
      "The draft conclusions contain four elements: proposals regarding policies and measures; general proposals; proposals relevant to the nature and mix of policies and measures; and lists of policies and measures. 'Proposals regarding policies and measures,' address: adoption of coordinated P&Ms; preparation of National Action Plans; national and regional programmes for climate change mitigation and protection; and enhancement of sinks and reservoirs.",
      "Some of the proposals refer to P&Ms with different priority levels, while others cite specific items such as removal of coal subsidies, technology development and transfer and promotion of renewable energy sources. The 'General proposals' support: identification of environmental and socio-economic impacts of P&Ms; compatibility between P&Ms and national development programmes; and cost-effective P&Ms.",
      "Some entries in 'Proposals relevant to the nature and mix of policies and measures,' call for individual, rather than coordinated, fulfillment of commitments and protection for developing countries, especially oil producing States.",
      "The section on 'Lists of policies and measures' begins with a proposal from the Chair that contains three lists regarding: policy objectives for all Annex I Parties; possible mechanisms for implementation of P&Ms and a menu of P&Ms from which Parties could choose according to their national circumstances.",
      "The Chair's proposal is followed by entries from several Parties including Canada, the EU, Switzerland and Japan.",
      "Each entry contains specific P&Ms. The Chair said some Parties have submitted 'negative' proposals, which note that they object to the inclusion of specific issues.",
      "He proposed including a general chapeau noting their objections and said that all ideas retained in the negotiating text do not have to be included in the Protocol.",
      "The proposal also contains several symbols and letters and the Chair said values would be attributed to them in future sessions.",
      "IRAN inquired about the possibility of elaborating on each proposal.",
      "The Chair noted that other proposals could be submitted later and asked delegates to refrain from making substantive statements. POLAND requested that each reference to a new Annex specify which Parties will be included.",
      "NEW ZEALAND deleted its proposal calling for compulsory phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies.",
      "The G-77/CHINA noted its intention to submit a proposal on P&Ms.",
      "The EU requested that certain items from its proposed list of P&Ms also be noted in the Chair's proposed list of P&Ms.",
      "The EU said it would submit 'List C,' containing P&Ms to be given priority by Parties listed in Annex X, as appropriate to national circumstances.",
      "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION requested retaining its proposals.",
      "One states that a protocol or other legal instrument should not change or replace statements of the Convention, including its principles.",
      "The other states that Parties to the protocol are guided by principles of the Convention. Delegates also commented on the Framework Compilation (FCCC/AGBM/1997/2 and Add.1).",
      "The EU deleted several paragraphs submitted by its member States because these submissions were superseded by the common EU proposal.",
      "The Chair noted that a section on education, training and public awareness, included in the addendum, would also be included in the negotiating text."
