      "The second day of COP 20 kicked off with a smooth ADP opening - so much so that the plenary was adjourned half an hour early.",
      "Delegates attending informal consultations and contact groups under the Subsidiary Bodies were also repeatedly reminded by the facilitators that efficient time management is a priority at this COP.",
      "The Peruvian Presidency's attention to time management seemed to fit well with the military surroundings of the venue, and the focused and concise mode of work was welcomed by many, even though some were taken aback by the 'if you - \u0099re not on board when the train starts to roll, you - \u0099ll have to catch up' attitude.",
      "As the ADP began negotiations on draft decision text and consideration of elements of the future agreement in parallel contact groups in the afternoon, this shift in gears was welcomed by a large number of parties.",
      "Yet, some began to worry that too much time had been wasted earlier in the year, and parties would now be left scrambling to address all issues on the ADP agenda for Lima.",
      "However, as one delegate noted, 'there is no other option'.",
      "'Parties will need to agree on how to make up for the lost time, and one can only hope this won't come at the expense of the efficient time management that we - \u0099ve now had a taste of'."
