      "In its conclusions ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2008/L.8 ), the AWG-LCA determines that it will shift into full negotiating mode in 2009, advancing negotiation on all elements of the Bali Action Plan; and calls on parties to put forward proposals on the content and form of the outcome to be agreed at COP 15, to enable parties to review and assess the scope and progress of negotiations at AWG-LCA 6 in June 2009.",
      "The AWG-LCA also requests the Secretariat to organize three workshops at its fifth session, on: developed country mitigation commitments and developing country mitigation actions; economic and social consequences of response measures; and opportunities and challenges for mitigation in the agriculture sector.",
      "Regarding the calendar of meetings for 2009, the AWG-LCA emphasizes that there should be sufficient time between sessions to allow party groupings to consider and coordinate their positions."
