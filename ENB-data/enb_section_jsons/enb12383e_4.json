      "Between COP 11 and COP 13 in December 2007, the AWG-KP and Convention Dialogue each convened four times.",
      "The AWG-KP focused on finalizing its work programme and analyzing mitigation potentials and ranges of emission reductions.",
      "At its meeting in Vienna, Austria, in August 2007, the AWG-KP discussed possible ranges of emission reductions for Annex I parties.",
      "Parties adopted conclusions referring to some of the key findings of IPCC Working Group III, including that global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak in the next 10-15 years and then be reduced to well below half of 2000 levels by the middle of the 21st century in order to stabilize atmospheric concentrations to the lowest level assessed by the IPCC.",
      "The AWG-KP s conclusions recognized that to achieve this level, Annex I parties as a group would be required to reduce emissions by a range of 25-40% below 1990 levels by 2020.",
      "During its four workshops, the Convention Dialogue focused on development goals, adaptation, technology, and market-based opportunities.",
      "At the final workshop, held in Vienna in August 2007, delegates focused on bringing together ideas from the previous workshops and addressing overarching and cross-cutting issues, including financing.",
      "Parties also considered next steps after COP 13, with parties expressing a willingness to continue discussions under the Convention track beyond COP 13 .",
      "In addition to the AWG-KP and Convention Dialogue, post-2012 issues were also considered under the first review of the Protocol under Article 9, held at COP/MOP 2 in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2006, and in discussions on a proposal by the Russian Federation on procedures to approve voluntary commitments for developing countries."
