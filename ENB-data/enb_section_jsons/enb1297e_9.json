      "On Tuesday, 3 November, Chair Kante convened a contact group, co-chaired by Bo Kjell\u00e9n (Sweden) and Mohammad Salamat (Iran), on Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects) and the related articles of the Kyoto Protocol (2.3 and 3.14).",
      "SAUDI ARABIA stressed the need for the contact group to produce an unambiguous text that could be adopted by the COP.",
      "The US and CANADA indicated that the issues raised by Articles 4.8 and 4.9 and the subsequent decisions should be separate.",
      "With AUSTRALIA, they said the issue should be considered in a non-political manner. The contact group met three times.",
      "In the first session, delegates discussed how to proceed.",
      "In the second and third sessions, they discussed a Co-Chairs\u0092 draft decision, which stated that the basic elements for further analysis should include: the identification of adverse effects; determination of the impacts of implementation measures in developing countries; the identification of the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties arising from such adverse effects and impacts; and determining further necessary actions related to funding, insurance and technology transfer to meet the needs of developing countries.",
      "A programme of work was proposed that included: an expert workshop (April 1999); further discussion in subsidiary bodies (SBSTA-10 and SBI-10, June 1999); identification of needs for further information needed (COP-5, October 1999); and decisions made (COP-6, October 2000). On Tuesday, 10 November, in describing the results of the contact group, Co-Chair Kjell\u00e9n said the text reflected the objectives and there was general agreement on outstanding issues.",
      "The two bracketed paragraphs in the preamble reflected the lack of time for full negotiation.",
      "The G-77/CHINA said there were compromises even in the unbracketed text.",
      "He said the group would accept the document, including the brackets, to preserve momentum.",
      "The US, with the EU, said the impression of general agreement was misleading.",
      "He said the contact group did not discuss this text and there was no agreement on the work plan.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA stated there was no consensus and suggested that if the whole text were bracketed, then all texts should be bracketed. The draft decision on FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 was adopted with two amendments and the removal of brackets from around the entire text (FCCC/CP/1998/L.9).",
      "Paragraph 4 in the preamble was expanded to read, 'Recognizing that in the implementation of the commitments in Article 4 of the Convention, the Parties shall give full consideration to what actions are necessary under the Convention, including actions related to funding, insurance and the transfer of technology, to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties arising from the adverse effects of climate change and/or the impact of the implementation of response measures.",
      "' The following paragraph was shortened and reads, 'Noting the provision under Article 12.8 of the Protocol.",
      "' Compared to the draft decision, the adopted text includes an expanded comment on the responsibilities of Annex I Parties under Articles 4.8 and 4.9, but limits discussion of specific commitments under Article 12 of the Protocol.",
      "The decision focuses on obtaining and compiling further information, continuing the analysis on adverse effects and includes a work plan for future action. Review of information/possible decisions under decision 9/CP.1: On Wednesday, 4 November, delegates considered the review of information and possible decisions under Article 4.2(f), which addresses amendments to FCCC Annexes (FCCC/CP/1998/13; FCCC/CP/1997/MISC.3).",

      "PAKISTAN requested Parties to delete Turkey from Annexes I and II.",
      "The EU said all OECD countries should have legally binding targets.",

      "The Secretariat provided a review of documentation and discussed gaps in data and reporting (FCCC/CP/1998/11; FCCC/CP/1998/11/Add.1; FCCC/CP/1998/11/Add.2).",
      "The debate included reference to the in-depth review process and the proposal for an exercise of data comparison (FCCC/CP/1998/4; FCCC/CP/1998/5; FCCC/CP/1998/MISC.8; FCCC/CP/1998/INF.9).",
      "The G-77/CHINA, with the PHILIPPINES and CHINA, expressed concern about: increasing emission trends among Annex II Parties; activities relating to financial resources and technology transfer; the lack of progress in the development of policies and measures; and gaps in reporting by Annex I Parties. NORWAY, with the EU, AUSTRALIA, the US and CANADA, stated that: the national communications and their reviews were important to the Convention process; reporting issues and guidelines required increased attention; and the Secretariat should conduct more analytical work.",
      "The EU, NEW ZEALAND, the US, SWITZERLAND, CANADA and NORWAY said the third national communication should be due in 2001.",
      "The EU, NORWAY and the US supported the Secretariat's proposed paper on comparison of activity data, but sought clarification on several technical and procedural issues. A contact group on national communications from Annex I Parties, chaired by Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania) and Alexander Metalnikov (Russian Federation), met over the weekend and formulated a draft decision.",
      "It proposed that the third national communications from Annex I Parties be due in 2001 and that subsequent national communications be due every three to five years.",
      "The decision included a statement on the need for further efforts by Parties to improve completeness, consistency and comparability of data and information, as well as participating, through the SBI, in evaluating and refining the review process.",
      "It proposed that the Secretariat complete a feasibility study on the potential usefulness of data comparison and report on information contained in annual national inventory submissions. On Tuesday, 10 November, in SBI plenary, the Co-Chairs of the contact group indicated that consensus was reached.",
      "The G-77/CHINA proposed bracketing a paragraph in the annex that noted that many Annex I Parties would not reduce GHGs to 1990 levels.",

      "Contact group Co- Chair El Ghaouth asked the Chair not to reopen debate on an agreed decision.",

      "URUGUAY and the REPUBLIC OF KOREA described their initial communications and national efforts underway to limit GHGs.",
      "The EU said communications should be considered on a country-level basis and more frequent workshops would be beneficial. On Monday, 9 November, the contact group on non-Annex I national communications, chaired by Paul Malcons (South Africa) and Dan Reifsnyder (US), considered a draft Co-Chairs' text.",
      "Discussion centered on a number of issues including: whether national communications would be evaluated and whether there would be a process of ongoing evaluation; whether a compilation and synthesis of non-Annex I national communications would be completed, and if so when; whether there would be in-country reviews; and whether workshops would help the consideration and/or preparation of national communications.

      "Several developing country Parties suggested a political reorientation of the GEF to meet their needs, such as the preparation of non-Annex I communications.",
      "Several developed country Parties suggested that the GEF should operate as the Convention's financial entity, although improvements were needed.",
      "Chair Kante called for unity among the delegates to resolve the status of the GEF and appealed for a solution. On Thursday, 5 November, the contact group on the financial mechanism, chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) and Dan Reifsnyder (US), met briefly and focused on procedural matters that would enable a decision to be reached.",
      "The G-77/CHINA, after considering comments to their initial proposal presented in the previous meeting, outlined two new proposals on the substantive issues, namely, the status of and guidance to the GEF.",
      "These documents were considered in a series of contact group meetings over the next few days. On Friday, 6 November, the contact group discussed a draft decision presented by the G-77/China (FCCC/CP/1998/MISC.3/Add.1).",

On 5 November, the contact group considering the review of Article 4.2 (a) and (b), chaired by Jennifer Irish (Canada) and Margaret Mukahanana (Zimbabwe) remained focused on establishing the approach to preparing a draft statement which, according to FCCC Article 4.2 (d), must be completed by 31 December 1998.",
