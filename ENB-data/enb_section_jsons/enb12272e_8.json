      "This expert meeting, organized by the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories with the assistance of WGI, was held from 2-4 May 2005, in Geneva, Switzerland, to conduct a preliminary assessment of issues related to developing estimates for anthropogenic emissions of aerosols and to discuss methodological approaches.",
      "Participants concluded that further meetings should be held, involving WGI, NGGIP and other aerosol inventory experts, and that these meetings should focus on several issues, including: the needs of speciated aerosols emission data and definitions; the use of existing inventory information; and improvements in certain key source sectors."
