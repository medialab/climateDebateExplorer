      "Summarizing the afternoon\u0092s discussions, Session Chair Richard Bradley noted that the traditional differences between North and South remained unresolved, with developed countries often focusing on the private sector and market forces, while developing countries tend to stress the role of the public sector and intergovernmental agreements.",
      "However, he highlighted participants\u0092 unanimous agreement that governments have an important role in terms of developing enabling environments.",
      "He also drew attention to participants\u0092 comments on the importance of sustainable, continuing engagement in technology transfer projects, on the need to consider how projects can lead to multiple benefits, and on the 'adaptation versus mitigation' issue.",
      "He suggested that the linkages between micro and macro approaches might require further discussion.",
      "He also noted comments on the role international mechanisms, such as the CDM, could play in encouraging technology transfer."
