      "A profound sense of relief swept the corridors late Monday morning as it finally emerged that Ministers and other high-level officials had achieved a result in Bonn on key political issues after 'marathon' talks.",
      "While many bleary-eyed observers were noting that this text involved many compromises, especially on the part of the EU and the G-77/China, most seemed elated that an agreement had been reached, even if the general perception was that it was not as strong as it could have been.",
      "Some participants noted that, with the US no longer in the Protocol picture, the remaining Umbrella Group members had 'held all the cards' coming into these talks, meaning that a result generally favoring their positions on key issues such as sinks, compliance and funding was always likely if a deal was to be struck at all.",
      "Several participants also suggested that this outcome was a 'victory for multilateralism."
