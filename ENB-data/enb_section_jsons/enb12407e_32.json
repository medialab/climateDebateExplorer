      "Although at first the AWG-LCA seemed to simply replay well-known positions and general statements, to many participants the session s discussions gradually became more practical and slightly more detailed.",
      "Submissions made prior to the meeting - constituting the basis of the Chair s note - could be characterized as containing a high level of abstraction.",
      "As this session progressed, however, more clarity emerged in certain contexts.",
      "This was particularly so in discussions on adaptation and the concept of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) by developing countries.",
      "Some also observed more convergence in discussions on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD) with regard to the inclusion of conservation (albeit in a differentiated manner) in REDD+, and more detail in the proposals.",
      "After the meeting, many veterans felt that the formal process of the AWG-LCA had moved forward, constituting a useful step towards consolidating ideas to be included in a negotiating text.",
      "However, all delegates were quick to point out that not only is there a surplus of issues on the table, but also substantive disagreement on many critical issues, especially with regard to specifying targets in a shared vision and whether the role of the Convention in finance and technology transfer should be more action-based or advisory.",
      "To be sure, discussions on governance challenges, especially with regard to finance and technology transfer, have just begun."
