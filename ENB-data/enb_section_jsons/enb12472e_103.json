   "sentences": [
      "In terms of enhancing dialogue, a number of complementary processes have emerged since Copenhagen.",
      "Interested developed and developing countries have joined together to explore the formation of interim partnerships seeking to share information and explore best practices.",
      "These coalitions of the willing have met on the fringes of the negotiations to discuss the adaptation partnership led by Spain, Costa Rica and US, the partnership on MRV led by Germany and South Africa, and the Norway and France REDD+ partnership.",
      "Many participants explained that they see these forums as leading to country-driven approaches, North-South and South-South cooperation and building support to scale-up of successful demonstration activities.",
      "While those involved in the partnerships have emphasized that they do not want to interfere with the UNFCCC process, some delegates have expressed concern that these processes may gain traction on their own and could influence political decisions within the negotiations, lead to fragmented frameworks competing with each other and the negotiations, or result in some countries being left behind.",
      "Several delegates were wondering about the transparency of these processes, how they would feed into the negotiations under the UNFCCC, and whether the UNFCCC process would maintain its central role in the response to climate change.",
      "Some simply characterized these efforts simply as dangerous for the UNFCCC process.",
      "On the other hand, many hoped that the emerging partnerships will build on the recent goodwill and dialogue.",
      "Others see them as a means to start financial flows and produce concrete progress.",
      "They argue that this will help provide the momentum and convince parties to make the political decisions and compromises that are needed to move the UNFCCC process forward. BONN OUTCOMES AND PROSPECTS FOR CANC\u00daN As pre-meeting hopes gave way to post-meeting realities, many felt that the Bonn session highlighted the challenges faced by delegates on the way to Canc\u00fan, including how ambitious they should be.",
      "On the AWG-LCA side, many said they felt unsure about the next steps: until we see the final version of the revised draft negotiating text released before the meeting in August, we re not going to know whether we can move forward with it, commented one delegate.",
      "She continued, without a text in front of us, it s too early to speculate on the outcome in Canc\u00fan.",
      "A senior observer emphasized that the path through Canc\u00fan and beyond requires political decisions from the top that will allow us to operationalize the blueprint that we have been working on for the last two and half years.",
      "Many felt that the Secretariat and the Mexican hosts of COP 16 are also trying to manage expectations for Canc\u00fan: while some still call for a legally binding agreement in Canc\u00fan, others are now saying it is unlikely, and were speculating on outcomes ranging from a variety of work programmes emerging from the Subsidiary Bodies, or agreement on issues under the AWGs on which there was substantial consensus in Copenhagen- such as REDD+ and finance- or on an broader architectural framework.",
      "However, others predict that some parties will not allow advanced individual issues, such as REDD+, adaptation and finance, to proceed independently of a larger political package and has parties considering the prospects for a comprehensive legally binding agreement in South Africa at COP 17 in 2011.",
      "After Copenhagen, everyone is now fully aware of the challenges involved in reaching an ambitious agreement - and yet, as the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, it is clear that stringent action is required now more than ever before, in order not to close the door to the 1.5 \u00b0C, or even 2 \u00b0C, world.",
      "Failure is therefore not an option."
