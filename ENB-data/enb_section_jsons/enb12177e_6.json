      "On Monday, 24 September, Chair Watson introduced the SPM of the Synthesis Report and the underlying draft longer part.",
      "He reported that approximately 50 lead authors, as well as review editors from the Bureau, had considered comments submitted by governments, NGOs and experts over the past week to prepare a revised draft of the SPM for this meeting. Noting that some comments had called for greater focus on uncertainties and beneficial effects of climate change while others had sought more emphasis on adverse impacts, Chair Watson underscored the need for a balanced document. Concerning the organization of work, Watson said that the Plenary would first consider and approve the SPM line-by-line and that the lead authors, working with the review editors, would then revise the underlying longer part to ensure its full consistency with the approved SPM.",
      "He stated that the revised underlying longer part would then be considered and adopted paragraph-by-paragraph by the Plenary to ensure consistency in tone, message and structure with the SPM and all underlying documents on which it is based."
