      "The approved answer to this question states that there are many opportunities to reduce near-term emissions and that technical progress in this regard has been faster than anticipated, but barriers exist to the deployment of these opportunities.",
      "The answer explains reasons behind the varying mitigation cost estimates of different models and studies, and notes substantial opportunities for lowering costs, for example, through use of carbon sinks and emissions trading.",
      "The answer discusses the well-established, albeit varied, 'spillover' effects on non-Annex I countries of emission constraints on Annex I countries.",
      "It explains how technology development and diffusion are important components of cost-effective stabilization, and how the pathway to meeting a particular stabilization target will have an impact on mitigation cost."
