      "Noting the concern of many non-Annex I Parties with regard to understanding the IPCC Special Report on LULUCF, Co-Chair Thorgeirsson said an extra day had been reserved for a briefing at the workshop in Poland in July.",
      "The G-77/CHINA said this did not reflect their request for regional workshops, and delegates agreed to an additional conclusion inviting the SBSTA to encourage workshops.",

      "He urged delegates to focus on requirements for COP-6, noting that capacity building could be achieved over a longer time period.",
      "AOSIS stressed the importance of regional workshops and questioned the mandate for an intersessional meeting. AUSTRALIA called for a compilation of central textual proposals to assist work at SBSTA-13.",
      "The EU distributed draft conclusions requesting parties to provide textual proposals to be presented with 1 August submissions and requesting the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis according to specific elements.",
      "CANADA, AOSIS and others proposed changes, and discussions continued late into the night."
