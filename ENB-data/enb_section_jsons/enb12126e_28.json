      "On Thursday afternoon, 13 April, Chair Dovland outlined some of the issues raised during the workshop.",
      "He took note of participants' comments that this had been a useful meeting and that work on this issue should continue, with possible future workshops tailored to specific issues.",
      "He observed, however, that further workshops on policies and measures would not be possible prior to COP-6.",
      "He noted the wide range of views on indicators, and expressed a personal view that a technical discussion would be the most beneficial way to approach this issue.",
      "He drew attention to comments on the need to ensure that relevant work is carried out in preparation for future workshops, and noted the suggestion that international organizations-such as the IEA and OECD-should be involved in these activities.",
      "He asked participants to reflect on the information and views presented at this workshop, and hoped that the positive approach adopted by participants would continue through the process leading to COP-6.",
      "He thanked the Governments of Denmark and France for co-sponsoring this event and drew the meeting to a close at 3:35 pm."
