      "Several informal meetings and consultations were held following SB-13.",
      "These included consultations on Articles 5, 7 and 8, LULUCF, compliance, mechanisms, adverse effects, and LDCs, as well as informal high- level consultations held in early October and chaired by Jan Pronk, the Dutch Environment Minister and President-designate of COP-6.",
      "These meetings resulted in some further progress.",
      "However, with such a complex array of political and technical issues on the table, and an emphasis on achieving agreement on the entire 'package' of issues under negotiation, many observers prior to COP-6 suggested that accommodating all countries' interests and aims could prove difficult."
