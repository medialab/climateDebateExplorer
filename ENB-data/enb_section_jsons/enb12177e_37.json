      "This decision addresses the appropriate size, structure and geographical representation of the IPCC Bureau. One delegate proposed to increase the membership of the Bureau to 50 or more, pointing to the greater decision-making responsibilities placed on it, given that Plenary sessions are now held less frequently.",
      "Chair Watson, supported by several delegates, noted that the real issue of concern is not the size of the Bureau, but its mandate and the fact that some members do not participate actively in its work and therefore do not fully represent their regions. Chair Watson proposed to maintain the current Bureau structure, suggesting that procedures be considered at a future session to enable regional groups to replace Bureau members who fail to participate actively and urged regional groups to select representatives who will truly represent their regions.",
      "Delegates agreed to the Chair's proposal.",
      "The Bureau will keep its 30 members with the current geographic balance, including a Chair, three Vice-Chairs with specific responsibilities, the two Co- Chairs and six Bureau members of each working group, and the two Co-Chairs of the TFI."
