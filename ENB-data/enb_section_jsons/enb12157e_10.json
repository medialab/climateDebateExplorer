      "SBI Chair Ashe opened the meeting of the contact group on the financial mechanism.",
      "The group discussed the revised Co-Chairs' text providing additional guidance to the operating entity of the financial mechanism.",
      "He noted that extensive 'informal informal' consultations had taken place during the past few days, and that most of the text had been agreed.",
      "He then invited delegates to consider the remaining bracketed paragraphs.",
      "Delegates discussed at length two options for text of a paragraph relating to the provision of GEF resources for country-driven Stage II adaptation activities, particularly the extent to which such activities would be based on national communications.",
      "Parties could not agree whether such activities should be in the context of/build upon national communications 'and' national studies, or national communications 'or' national studies.",
      "The text remains in brackets. The group discussed text on demonstration projects, which remained bracketed.",
      "Delegates also discussed outstanding text requesting the GEF to continue to provide financing, where appropriate, and consistent with both the guidance of the COP and the GEF's mandate, to support the implementation of the capacity building framework, and to further support, enhance and implement the GEF's capacity building activities in accordance with the framework.",
      "However, the text remains bracketed.",
      "Delegates agreed that the Co- Chairs should work on integrating language in paragraphs on reporting and on streamlining.",
      "Co-Chair Ashe said the text would be presented to SBI on Saturday."
