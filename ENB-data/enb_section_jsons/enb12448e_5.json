      "COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 took place in December 2007, in Bali, Indonesia.",
      "The focus was on long-term issues and the negotiations resulted in the adoption of the Bali Action Plan (BAP), establishing the AWG-LCA with a mandate to focus on key elements of long-term cooperation identified during the Convention Dialogue, namely: mitigation; adaptation; finance; and technology and capacity building.",
      "The BAP also called for articulating a shared vision for long-term cooperative action, including a long-term global goal for emission reductions.",
      "Parties agreed on a two-year negotiating process, the Bali Roadmap, which included tracks under the Convention and the Protocol and set a deadline for concluding the negotiations in Copenhagen.",
      "The two key bodies under the Bali Roadmap are the AWG-LCA and the AWG-KP, which held four negotiation sessions in 2008: April in Bangkok, Thailand; June in Bonn, Germany; August in Accra, Ghana; and December in Pozna\u00c5\u0084, Poland."
