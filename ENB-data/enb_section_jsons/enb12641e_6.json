      "Co-Facilitator Franz Perrez (Switzerland) proposed continuing to address issues as they have been placed in the Tool and using spin-offs to advance common understanding.",
      "He listed topics that require further discussion: response measures; collective effort and links to the long-term goal; the balance and mapping of the agreement and decisions; progression; land use and REDD+; and international transportation.",
      "SOUTH AFRICA reported on the spin-off group on differentiation, noting interest in the debate and the diversity of views.",
      "BOLIVIA reported on the spin-off group on non-market issues, noting lack of agreement on this issue.",
      "While regretting that little negotiating time remains before COP 21, parties\u2019 views diverged on the utility of the spin-off groups and how to proceed in negotiations.",
      "Suggestions were made to either: use spin-off groups to deepen understanding; move issues from part 3 of the Tool (provisions whose placement requires further clarity) to the sections for the agreement or decisions; address issues thematically; or move paragraph-by-paragraph through the text.",
      "After an extensive debate, parties agreed that the spin-off group on differentiation would continue, the spin-off group on joint implementation would meet as planned, and the Co-Facilitators would show a slide with the headings from the Co-Chairs\u2019 Tool and their placement at the next meeting of the facilitated group."
