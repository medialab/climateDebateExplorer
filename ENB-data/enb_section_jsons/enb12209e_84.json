      "Australia and the US introduced a new dichotomy into the climate change negotiations last year by behaving as if the Protocol is somehow antithetical to the goals of the UNFCCC.",
      "The US repudiation of the Protocol has been particularly damaging, and at COP-8, many observers noted that the US delegation interfered in progress on several Protocol issues besides the Delhi Declaration. For instance, the US delegation substantially affected discussions on the issue of trade in cleaner energy.",
      "The original proposal by Canada on cleaner energy would have given it assigned amount units for the environmental benefit created by its exports to the US of cleaner energy.",
      "Most Parties objected to this proposal at SB-16 in Bonn, with the notable exception of the US.",
      "When the US objected at COP-8 to a new Canadian proposal, which merely requested an analysis of the role of trade in cleaner energy, some could not help but speculate that the US was trying to discourage Canadian ratification.",
      "Other more sympathetic observers believed the US objected to stem discussion on adverse effects, which the G-77/China had linked to the Canadian proposal during discussions on the SB-16 agenda.",
      "In any event, although discussions on cleaner energy did not lead to substantive conclusions, Canada gave no indication that this would dampen the Prime Minister\u0092s resolve to ratify the Protocol."
