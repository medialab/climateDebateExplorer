      "Co-facilitator Tosi Mpanu Mpanu facilitated this session, which focused on the co-facilitators\u2019 proposals for streamlining. Parties considered merging options a and b of paragraph 132.1 on commitments in relation to enabling the development and transfer of technology to developing countries.",
      "In consolidating, parties focused on steps by developed countries to: leverage enhanced support from the private sector for technology development and transfer to developing countries; address barriers to accessing technology \u201cand know-how\u201d; and promote access to public sector technology, and its development and transfer to developing countries. The group unpacked paragraph 133.2 on guidance to, and strengthening of, the Technology Mechanism/institutional arrangements.",
      "Parties reorganized the text around the following themes: support for the operationalization and delivery of commitments related to technology; enhanced cooperation and synergy with other institutions; and review of adequacy and effectiveness. TUVALU suggested that \u201cincluding provisions on accounting\u201d and \u201cspecific needs of countries with special circumstances in Africa, the LDCs and SIDS\u201d can be applied to all themes.",

      "Parties said these paragraphs contain separate concepts and agreed they should not be merged. Supported by the US and AUSTRALIA, MEXICO proposed changing reference to \u201cdeveloped parties\u201d in paragraph 132.1 to \u201call parties,\u201d noting that both developed and developing countries need to address barriers to technology transfer.",
      "SOUTH AFRICA, CHINA and the UAE argued this would go beyond streamlining.",
