      "More than anything else, Bonn II was defined by the six-month rule.",
      "From a practical point of view, this reminded everyone that negotiations are supposed to be concluded in Copenhagen in six months.",
      "From a legal point of view, this rule refers to provisions in both the Convention and Protocol requiring parties to communicate text for possible new protocols (Convention Article 17) or amendments to the Protocol (Protocol Articles 20.2 and 21.3) at least six months before the session or meeting where they are proposed for adoption.",
      "For this reason, whether and what texts were forwarded from this meeting to Copenhagen, and how (collectively or individually), can be expected to impact the possible range of legal outcomes from Copenhagen.",
      "In short, where the negotiations go from here depends on the forces that were put into motion in Bonn.",
      "Although both the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA came into the meeting with text to discuss, and both groups sought to ensure that all parties proposals were adequately expressed therein, the texts evolved quite differently over the course of the meeting.",
      "While the AWG-LCA text sailed rather uncontroversially through the meeting, with parties simply adding and clarifying proposals and stating views, the AWG-KP texts were discussed in more depth, with attempts to consolidate proposals for LULUCF and Annex I targets, and persistent tension about the breadth of the group s mandate."
