      "The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen was, in many ways, an historic event.",

      "Millions of people around the world hoped that Hopenhagen would be a turning point in the battle against climate change.",
      "The high-level segment brought together 115 Heads of State and Government, and was widely reported as one of the largest high-level gathering outside New York.",
      "More than 40,000 people applied for accreditation for the Conference, far exceeding the 15,000 capacity of the Conference venue.",
      "Large, and at times violent, demonstrations took place in Copenhagen during the Conference as people urged the world s leaders to reach a meaningful agreement.",
      "There is little doubt that the Copenhagen Conference left its mark in history - never before has climate change featured so prominently on the international agenda.",
      "However, feelings about the outcome are, at best, mixed and some even consider the Conference to be a failure.",
      "This brief analysis focuses on the Copenhagen outcome, both in terms of substance and process, examining what the outcome might mean for the UNFCCC process, and most importantly, for the battle against climate change."
