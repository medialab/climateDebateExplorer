      "On Wednesday, IPCC Chair Pachauri introduced the SYR Progress Report (IPCC-XXXVII/Doc.22, Corr.1).",
      "Updating the Panel on changes made to the draft SYR, he noted the insertion of boxes addressing cross-cutting issues, the removal of duplicative materials, and the inclusion of text on GHG metrics.",
      "Germany inquired why the metrics and boxes were added and Sweden asked how the selection of the topics in the boxes was determined.",
      "IPCC Chair Pachauri and SYR TSU Head Leo Meyer explained that the boxes were chosen by the authors to deal with cross-cutting issues, providing a clear understanding of issues that cut across the SYR.",
      "Canada suggested the inclusion of boxes on recent temperature trends and, with Germany, geo-engineering, should be re-considered.",
      "Russia stressed that the SYR must be based on the conclusions of the three WG reports."
