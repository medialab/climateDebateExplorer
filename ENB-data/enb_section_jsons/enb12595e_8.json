      "The Bonn Climate Change Conference took place from 3-14 June 2013.",
      "SBI 38 was characterized by an agenda dispute concerning a proposal by the Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine to introduce a new item on legal and procedural issues related to decision-making under the COP and CMP.",
      "As no solution to the dispute was found, the SBI was unable to launch substantive work.",
      "SBSTA 38 achieved what many saw as good progress, inter alia , on REDD+ and several methodological issues.",
      "The resumed ADP 2 was structured around workshops and roundtables.",
      "No agreement was reached on establishing one or more contact groups to move part of the work to a more formal setting.",
      "Many, however, felt that switching to a negotiating mode will be important to ensure that the ADP makes progress in future sessions."
