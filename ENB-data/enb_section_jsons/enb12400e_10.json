      "Tuesday was a day of a few firsts in the AWG-KP process: legal issues were taken up in the plenary for the very first time, and the new contact group on Annex I emission reductions held its first meeting.",
      "Some of those familiar with the AWG-KP process were feeling pleased towards the end of the day, commenting that more detail and substance was gradually being injected into the discussions.",
      "For instance, while the AWG-KP contact group discussions on emission reductions did not produce big surprises, some were gossiping about the possibility that some new numbers could be brought to the table during the meeting.",
      "Some, however, expressed fear that LULUCF was being used to detain progress on establishing targets, and that several industrialized parties were vying for establishing complex rules to cushion reduction commitments.",
      "The legally-minded, in turn, were busy contemplating various ways of translating the results of the Bali Roadmap into a legal format.",
      "Some participants seemed passionate about sticking to the Kyoto Protocol and worried about opening all the embedded political compromises, while others were willing to consider a new treaty the only thing that would fly with the US.",
      "The AWG-LCA s day seemed to progress smoothly or, as some felt, as expected.",
      "Some delegates leaving the contact group on a shared vision seemed disappointed though, complaining that the discussions still did not fulfill their expectations.",
      "One delegate was seemingly bored commenting, You just know what each country is going to say before they open their mouths."
