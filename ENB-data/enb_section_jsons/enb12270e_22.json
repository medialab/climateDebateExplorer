      "This item was first taken up on Thursday, 19 May, in SBSTA\u0092s opening plenary, when Murray Ward (New Zealand) presented the results of informal consultations held before SB 22.",
      "He announced that the international transaction log (ITL) would not be operative before the second half of 2006, noted that CDM projects cannot participate in the EU carbon market until the ITL is operational, and underscored the Secretariat\u0092s funding needs. Informal consultations were successful, and in the SBSTA closing plenary on Friday, 27 May, Murray Ward announced that details are in place for the Secretariat to test the ITL, which is thus expected to be ready by the third quarter of 2006."
