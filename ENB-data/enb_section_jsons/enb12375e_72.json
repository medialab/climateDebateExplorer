      "Technology transfer was taken up by the SBI, SBSTA and the AWG-LCA.",
      "For more on discussions in those other groups, see pages 4 and 9.",
      "The SBI agenda item on this issue (FCCC/SBI/2008/5 & 7, MISC.1, and INF.1) was first taken up in the SBI plenary on Wednesday, 4 June, when EGTT Chair Jukka Uosukainen (Finland) reported on the EGTT s work.",
      "It was subsequently considered in two contact groups.",
      "The main points of contention were the EGTT s work programme, the terms of reference for the review of the effectiveness of the implementation of Convention Articles 4.5 and 4.1(c) (technology transfer) (FCCC/SBI/2008/7), and a report of the GEF on a strategic programme to scale up the level of investment for technology transfer (FCCC/SBI/2008/5).",
      "On the EGTT work programme, (FCCC/SB/2008/INF.1), a joint SBI/SBSTA contact group, co-chaired by Holger Liptow (Germany) and Carlos Fuller (Belize), was established.",
      "Discussions in this group included the EGTT s availability to requests from the SBI or SBSTA.",
      "This group produced three paragraphs of text that were subsequently included in the SBI and SBSTA conclusions.",
      "Richard Hosier, GEF, reported in plenary on 4 June on a strategic programme to scale up technology transfer investment (FCCC/SBI/2008/5), noting that the GEF Council could not finalize a draft programme for consideration in Bonn.",
      "The EU and Japan welcomed the GEF s report, while the G-77/China said the report deviates from the Bali mandate.",
      "These matters were taken up in a contact group and informal consultations co-chaired by Philip Gwage (Uganda) and Holger Liptow (Germany).",
      "In the contact group, China expressed disappointment with the GEF paper, and Ghana said the paper did not conform to the terms of reference given by the COP in decision 4/CP.13.",
      "Some parties suggested a follow-up paper by the GEF more accurately reflecting the guidance given by the COP.",
      "One of the main points of contention was how to react to input from the GEF that most parties considered did not meet their expectations.",
      "On the terms of reference of the review, Canada, the US and Japan, opposed by Ghana, suggested using the EGTT s performance indicators.",
      "The proposed text was heavily bracketed.",
      "Noting lack of agreement, parties decided to begin again and discuss the structure of terms of reference.",
      "Those discussions will inform future draft terms of reference to be elaborated by the SBI Chair, although they are not reflected in any formal document."
