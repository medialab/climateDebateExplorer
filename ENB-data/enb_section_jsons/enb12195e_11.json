      "The 'hot' issue among delegates over the weekend had less to do with climate change than with national pride.",
      "As negotiations continued on Friday and Saturday, many participants\u0092 attention seemed to be on events thousands of miles away in Asia - and, perhaps surprisingly, it was not those taking place in Bali. Dozens of delegates had their eyes glued to television screens showing the latest World Cup action, with many seemingly unable to tear themselves away from 'crucial' games such as England\u0092s thriller against Argentina.",
      "The level of interest was so great that delegates postponed a LULUCF meeting to avoid a clash with Brazil\u0092s fixture against China.",
      "Indeed, the passion displayed for the 'beautiful game' here in Bonn had one observer jokingly questioning what further tense clashes on the pitch might mean for North-South relations. On a more serious note, Canada\u0092s proposal to change the baseline year for 'reforestation' caused a flurry of diplomatic activity late Saturday night."
