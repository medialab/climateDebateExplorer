      "Delegates met informally in the morning and early afternoon, before resuming their work in the drafting group mid-afternoon.",
      "Discussions continued to focus on institutional arrangements.",
      "Developing countries repeated their position on the need for an adaptation committee, while developed countries maintained a preference for strengthening existing bodies.",
      "One developed country said ineffective action on adaptation is not due to the absence of a committee, but because NAPAs and technology funding are lacking.",
      "However, developing countries said a new committee could play an important role in technically evaluating and approving projects, with funding decisions taking place elsewhere.",
      "One developing country said current institutions often confuse adaptation projects with development projects and argued that a technical committee would help.",
      "Delegates agreed that at AWG-LCA 12, parties would focus on what has been done, what is needed, what remains to be done, and how to proceed.",
      "Several parties also noted that only institutional arrangements had been addressed up to this point."
