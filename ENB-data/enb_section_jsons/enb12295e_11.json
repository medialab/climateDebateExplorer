      "In the decision on the budget, the Panel: thanks the IPCC Chair and the IPCC Secretary for their efforts to improve the presentation of the programme and budget; encourages the Secretariat to continue to make improvements by providing more detail in the presentation of its past and projected expenses, and to examine the issue of constant over- estimation in the budget and work towards accurate forecasting; adopts the budget for 2007; notes the forecast budget for 2008 and the indicative budget for 2009; thanks the US government for its special contribution to the translation and publication of the 2006 Guidelines into the five UN languages other than English; recognizes that a certain amount of carry over is necessary to ensure continuation of the IPCC programme of work and the transition to the next assessment period, and that the carry over may vary from year to year, due to the cyclical nature of the assessment; and invites governments that may be in a position to do so to contribute to the IPCC Trust Fund."
