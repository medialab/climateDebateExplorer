      "Rob Gross, UNDP/NCSP Consultant, spoke about a project to develop a practical methodology handbook for conducting technology needs assessments.",
      "He emphasized that the project will build on existing work, with the goal being to go beyond the level of explaining the process of technology transfer and actually to develop useful guidance on how resource and technology options, market and institutional issues and policy priorities can work to the advantage of specific countries.",
      "He stressed that some issues will be generic while other topics will be country specific.",
      "Indicating that the handbook will be a 'living document' that will evolve over time and can be adapted to particular circumstances, he said that a final draft should be available in September 2002."
