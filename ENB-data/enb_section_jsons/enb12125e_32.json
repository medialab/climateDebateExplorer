      "Jonathan Pershing, Head of the Energy and Environment Division, International Energy Agency, reviewed macro and micro analyses of the impacts of response measures, with particular emphasis on the energy sector.",
      "He concluded that, in spite of some shortcomings, such models can offer insights on specific policy options.",
      "He presented a framework for analyzing individual policies and their impacts, and applied it to an EU voluntary agreement on CO2 reductions in the transport sector.",
      "He concluded that, in this example, the adverse effects were negligible and there were ancillary policy benefits.",
      "In looking at these models and approaches, he said it is difficult to evaluate the impacts and separate climate policy consequences from other factors.",
      "He also suggested that near-term impacts are likely to be relatively minor, but that this may not apply in the longer term."
