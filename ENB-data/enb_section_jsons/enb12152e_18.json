      "A key element of the Kyoto Protocol is a compliance system that can determine whether countries have met their commitments under the Protocol, as well as deciding what should happen in cases of non-compliance.",
      "Delegates generally agree that the system should provide for both facilitation and enforcement approaches to dealing with compliance issues, with the latter only applying to Annex I Parties.",
      "The G-77/China advocates that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should govern the system and that, consequently, specific facilitation consequences should apply to developing countries.",
      "Some developed countries stress that it is the nature of the commitment that should direct an issue to facilitation or enforcement consequences.",
      "On the composition of the body dealing with enforcement, the G-77/China urges the application of equitable geographical representation while developed countries favor a stronger representation of Annex I Parties.",
      "Delegates also disagree on, inter alia, the nature of the applicable consequences, with the EU and small island developing Parties being the most strident in favor of strong penalties, and the relationship between the compliance body and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties."
