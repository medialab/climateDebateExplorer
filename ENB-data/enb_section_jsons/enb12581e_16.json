      "This section was addressed on Monday, 23 September.",
      "On the first sentence stating that the WGI report considers evidence of past and future climate change based on many independent scientific analyses from observations of the climate system, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes, and simulations using climate models, Saudi Arabia proposed clarifying that evidence of future climate change is based on models and simulations only.",
      "Australia suggested deleting 'past and future', and others agreed.",
      "Concerning the evidence that the key findings of the report are based on, Saudi Arabia suggested adding 'assumptions' or 'scientific assumptions' to the list.",
      "The addition of 'scientific assumptions' was supported by Brazil and opposed by Austria, Canada, Germany and Belgium.",
      "The latter underscored that assumptions are already implicitly included in the already-listed theory, models and expert judgement.",
      "The Group rejected the insertion."
