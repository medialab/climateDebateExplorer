      "If there was one word that dominated discussions at the Hague it was 'sinks' (known to climate change cognoscenti as 'LULUCF').",
      "This issue characterizes the attempts of negotiators to strike the right balance between promoting ratification of the Protocol, while at the same time maintaining its environmental integrity.",
      "While there is little doubt disagreement on sinks was a principal stumbling block, this issue was not the only impediment to progress.",
      "Strongly divergent political opinions were also evident on each of the other 'technical' matters on which text had been developed. While it appears that credible compromises were made on many of these issues, there are four key concerns which remain, and which are likely to dominate future attempts to salvage COP-6: LULUCF, the Protocol mechanisms, the nature of the compliance regime, and financing."
