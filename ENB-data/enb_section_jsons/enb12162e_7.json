      "In the introduction, the note states that it addresses key unresolved issues contained in the documents transmitted to the COP by the subsidiary bodies at the close of their thirteenth sessions on 18 November.",
      "It also draws on ideas emerging during the course of negotiations, and takes into account the 'state of play' at the conclusion of the four informal sub- groups launched on 21 November.",
      "The note does not address outstanding issues relating to Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8, suggesting these can be resolved once other issues have been dealt with.",
      "It addresses outstanding issues in four sections based on the 'clusters' or 'boxes' that formed the basis for negotiations during the previous few days."
