      "In these conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.5), the SBSTA notes the report of the EGTT, which concludes that the success of technology transfer is dependent on wide stakeholder involvement, and that governments have a crucial role in creating favorable conditions.",
      "It encourages business and industry NGOs and relevant international organizations to convene sector-specific workshops and activities to exchange experiences and lessons learned. The SBSTA requests the EGTT to consider including activities on the development of environmentally sound technologies in its work activities, consider the outcomes of the workshop on synergies, and recommend further actions to SBSTA.",
      "It also requests the Secretariat to organize senior-level round-table discussions between governments, business and industry at COP-9, and a special meeting of the EGTT in conjunction with the technology events planned by the Government of India in November 2003; and continue its work on the development of links with relevant technology information systems and clearing houses, and existing national/regional technology centers as a way of showcasing potential opportunities for technology transfer identified through Parties\u0092 technology needs assessment.",
      "The Secretariat is requested to report on the outcomes of the activities to SBSTA at its subsequent sessions."
