      "In its conclusions (FCCC/KP/WG/2007/L.2), the AWG: reaffirms its focus on further Annex I commitments to be established in amendments to Annex B of the Protocol; recalls that its work should be guided by a shared vision of the challenge set by the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC; considers that the information received provided useful parameters for the overall level of ambition of further Annex I emissions reductions; notes the usefulness of information in the IPCC AR4, in particular in the contribution of Working Group III; indicates that it has initiated the implementation of its work programme; lists the key inputs from parties, presenters and observers during AWG 3 in eight bullet points, which address emission ranges, economic potential, mitigation policies and technologies, barriers, carbon price signals, co-benefits, spillover effects, and flexibility mechanisms and sinks; agrees to continue the analysis of mitigation potential at AWG 4 and also address the possible ranges of emissions reductions; agrees to analyze possible means to achieve mitigation objectives at AWG 5; invites submissions from parties in position to do so by 22 June 2007, with information and data on mitigation potentials of policies, measures and technologies at their disposal; requests the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper synthesizing these submissions and available information; invites parties and accredited observer organizations to submit by 15 February 2008 information and views on means to achieve Annex I mitigation objectives; agrees to continue with its work programme; and agrees to consider the work programme at the resumed AWG 4 in Bali and also develop a timetable to guide its work in order to avoid a gap between the first and second commitment period."
