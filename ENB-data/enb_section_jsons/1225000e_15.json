      "Yang Yanyi recalled the obligation of developed countries to take the lead in combating climate change, and to provide new and additional financial resources and transfer environmentally sound technologies to assist the developing countries in fulfilling their commitments.",
      "These obligations have not been fulfilled, and the threat of global climate change remains.",
      "The decisions taken at Berlin, such as the establishment of the SBI and the SBSTA, the agreement on the GEF as the interim financial mechanism, and the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly, are encouraging steps toward the realization of the goals of the Convention.",
      "Most important, however, was the agreement to intensify the commitments of the developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, which by no means should increase the obligations of the developing countries.",
      "China is committed to doing its part to address climate change based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities."
