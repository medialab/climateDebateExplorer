      "On 7 November, the Secretariat presented the annual review of greenhouse gas inventories and updated inventory guidelines (FCCC/SBSTA/2006/INF.4; FCCC/SBSTA/2006/9 ) to the SBSTA plenary.",
      "Chair Kumarsingh reminded parties that inventories will be reviewed in 2007.",
      "He prepared draft conclusions and a draft COP decision on the item, which were subsequently adopted by SBSTA on 14 November and by the COP on 17 November. SBSTA Conclusions : The conclusions noted with concern the high volume of review work in 2007 and noted the need for flexibility from the Secretariat in submission of reviews. COP Decision: The decision ( FCCC/SBSTA/2006/L.20/Add.1 ) recognizes that streamlining the review process was required during the 2006-2007 period and that it may reschedule the 2006 greenhouse gas inventory submissions to facilitate coordination with other reviews."
