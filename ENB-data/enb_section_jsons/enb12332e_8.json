      "Various views were expressed by delegates departing the plenary at the end of the Dialogue workshop on Thursday afternoon.",
      "While some were disappointed that the talk had yet to translate into action, others seemed pleased at the relatively open and constructive exchanges.",
      "It is hard to say where this is leading us, but something seems to be slowly taking shape, said one observer looking ahead to the fourth and final workshop in Vienna.",
      "I suspect parties will be studying some interesting proposals from South Africa and others on possible ways forward, observed another.",
      "Meanwhile, as delegates left the AWG contact group on Thursday evening to start Friends of the Chair talks, some were reflecting on the sensitive nature of the discussions.",
      "The contact group was fine, but I suspect we will see the difficult, political issues such as ranges and timetables bog things down now we're going into informals, cautioned one."
