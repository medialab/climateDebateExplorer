      "This year was a make-or-break-year for international climate change negotiations.",
      "After the debacle in Copenhagen in 2009, many agreed that without a positive, balanced outcome in Cancun, there would be little chance of achieving meaningful global action on climate change and restoring trust in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol.",
      "When the Cancun Agreements were adopted early on Saturday morning, there was a visible, cumulative sigh of relief.",
      "The Agreements, reflecting five years of work, leave many important details open, but garnered support from all but one of the Convention s 194 parties.",
      "The beacon of hope has been reignited and faith in the multilateral climate change process has been restored, said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres.",
      "This brief analysis will first consider the political dynamics and negotiating process leading to the Cancun Agreements.",
      "It will then analyze their substantive achievements and conclude with an assessment of what this means for the next UN Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, in 2012, and for international cooperation in addressing climate change."
