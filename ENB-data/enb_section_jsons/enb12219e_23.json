      "IPCC good practice guidance and other information on LULUCF were discussed in the SBSTA on Wednesday, 4 June, and draft conclusions were adopted on Thursday, 12 June.",
      "Informal consultations were facilitated by Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe) and Audun Rosland (Norway). On Wednesday, 4 June, the IPCC reported on its work on LULUCF and the second-order drafts regarding good practice guidance, and definitions and methodological options to inventory emissions from direct human-induced degradation of forests and devegetation of other vegetation types.",
      "Reporting on the work of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests, the FAO noted the importance of, inter alia, consistent forest and carbon-related terminology and rationalized methods for assessing forest carbon stocks and their changes. On Thursday, 12 June, the SBSTA adopted the draft conclusions, which are based on the three IPCC tasks, including: good practice guidance on LULUCF; definitions on degradation and devegetation; and the factoring out of natural and indirect human effects on carbon stock change."
