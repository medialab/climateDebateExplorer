      "In its decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2008/L.6), the COP/MOP notes with serious concern delays in project registration and CER issuance and urges the Board to take effective action to speed up the completeness check process.",
      "The COP/MOP also requests the Board to: classify, index and publish decisions, clarify their hierarchy, demonstrate the relationship between new and previous decisions, and further substantiate decisions as soon as possible in 2009; summarize systematically the major issues that trigger review requests and compile and make publicly available the major criteria for decision-making during the review process; adhere to the principle that any decision, guidance, tool and rule shall not be applied retroactively; complete, as its highest priority, its revision of the DOE accreditation process and complete its accreditation standard; develop and apply, as a priority, a system for continuous monitoring of DOEs and improving their performance; facilitate accreditation of DOEs from developing countries; finalize prior to COP/MOP 5 work on a policy framework to address non-compliance by DOEs in a systematic manner, including transparent criteria for sanctions; and analyze possible arrangements for ensuring that projects under validation or verification by suspended DOEs are not prejudiced by suspension.",
      "On methodologies and additionality, the COP/MOP requests the Board to further enhance the objectivity regarding approaches to demonstrating additionality and determination of emission baselines.",
      "It also requests the Board to provide, as a matter of urgency, guidance on the programme of activities, and asks the Board to assess the implications of the possible inclusion of CCS in geological formations as CDM activities, taking into account technical, methodological and legal issues, and report back to COP/MOP 5.",
      "Additionally, it requests the Board to assess the implications of the possible inclusion of lands with forests in exhaustion as afforestation and reforestation CDM activities, taking into account technical, methodological and legal issues, and report back to COP/MOP 5.",
      "On regional and subregional distribution, the COP/MOP: encourages bilateral cooperation, and further private sector engagement in the CDM and DOEs to establish offices and partnerships in developing countries; requests the Board to develop, in cooperation with DOEs, ways to streamline the CDM process in countries hosting fewer than 10 projects, especially in LDCs, SIDS and Africa, without compromising environmental integrity; requests the Board, taking into account its workload, to facilitate the development and approval of methodologies based on the specific needs, and potential for, application in countries underrepresented in the CDM; and encourages parties and the private sector to support the identification and development of project design documents in countries hosting fewer than ten registered CDM projects, especially in LDCs, SIDS and Africa, and to meet the cost of validating these projects."
