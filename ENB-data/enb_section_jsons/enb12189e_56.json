      "This issue was considered in the SBSTA meeting on 30 October.",
      "The EU, supported by AOSIS, China and Saudi Arabia, opposed the inclusion of harvested wood products (HWP) in the first commitment period.",
      "New Zealand noted slow progress on the development of technical methodologies and, supported by Japan, Canada and Malaysia, suggested further technical review.",

      "On 6 November, SBSTA adopted the conclusions. In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2001/L.12), the SBSTA: notes the IPCC intention to include HWP in its development of good practice guidance; encourages further work on HWP by interested Parties; invites Party submissions for consideration at SBSTA-18; requests the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper on HWP accounting; and decides to further consider the issue at SBSTA-20 and SBSTA- 21."
