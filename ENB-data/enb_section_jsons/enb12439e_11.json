      "The spin-off group on LULUCF met several times informally throughout the session.",
      "Parties considered Annex II of document FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/10/Add.3/Rev.1, on options to address the treatment of LULUCF.",
      "The spin-off group heard presentations from parties on LULUCF data submissions and narrowed down options on forest management issues.",
      "In the final contact group session, Facilitator Rocha highlighted progress on issues related to natural disturbances, harvested wood products and wetlands and clarification of LULUCF accounting implications on emission reductions targets.",
      "Status of the negotiations: Parties agreed to forward non-paper no.",
      "2 on options and proposals on how to address definitions, modalities, rules and guidelines for the treatment of LULUCF to the AWG-KP Chair who will decide whether to include it in revised documentation or as a non-paper in Barcelona.",
      "Basket of Methodological Issues: On this issue ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/10/Add.2 ), discussions focused on three topics: common metrics to calculate the CO2 equivalence of emissions by sources and removals by sinks; 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; and inclusion of new greenhouse gases in Protocol Annex A.",
      "On common metrics , parties discussed whether to use global warming potentials (GWPs) provided by the IPCC in the Fourth Assessment Report, leave them unchanged until possible action by the SBSTA on global temperature potentials, or continue using the Protocol s provisions on GWPs.",
      "Vice-Chair Dovland suggested the last option as the basis for moving forward.",
      "The EU responded that they could move towards compromise if language was added on the implications of adding new greenhouse gases.",
      "On guidelines , parties discussed whether to use the IPCC 2006 Guidelines, UNFCCC reporting guidelines as revised by the SBSTA in its work programme, or a hybrid of the two.",
      "The EU stressed that the first option provides clarity on what needs to be done, when and by whom.",
      "Brazil emphasized that the process in the SBSTA must not be prejudged and that it is necessary to maintain coherent reporting guidelines under the Convention and Protocol.",
      "Australia underscored that the second option integrates a strong foundation with the ongoing SBSTA process.",
      "She agreed to take the lead on informal consultations with Brazil and the EU, to look for ways to resolve the issue.",
      "On new greenhouse gases , parties considered whether enough information was available to include new gases in the Protocol, the form such additions should take, and which gases to include.",
      "The Secretariat presented information on GWPs, and on current and likely future uses of the possible new greenhouse gases or classes of gases.",
      "Parties discussed: reporting burdens; criteria for determining inclusion of new gases; the adequacy of GWPs as a measure of what the atmosphere sees ; and which gases or classes of gases might be included.",
      "Australia, Japan and Canada highlighted a lack of information on certain gases.",
      "Brazil, China, and Senegal opposed amending Annex A to include new gases.",
      "The EU proposed considering a process through which new gases could be added by using COP/MOP decisions.",
      "In the final contact group meeting on 9 October, Vice-Chair Dovland reported that on common metrics, a new proposal from New Zealand had been included, the three options on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines had been consolidated into one bracketed option, and the section on new gases remained unchanged.",
      "New Zealand clarified that their new option on common metrics takes into account uncertainties involved in using GWPs and calls for clear commitment by the SBSTA to resolve common metrics issues for the third commitment period.",
      "The Federated States of Micronesia called for reflection of their proposal on new gases in the text.",
      "Status of the negotiations : Vice-Chair Dovland noted that non-paper no.",
      "1 would be amended to reflect these discussions and would serve the basis for continued work by parties in Barcelona.",
      "Potential Consequences: This issue ( FCCC/KP/AWG2009/12 ) relates to the consideration of information on potential environmental, economic and social consequences, including spillover effects, of tools, policies, measures and methodologies available to Annex I parties, and was considered in contact groups and informal consultations from 28 September to 7 October.",
      "Discussions in the contact group centered on methods for deepening understanding and a possible system to respond to negative consequences.",
      "South Africa, for the G-77/China, supported by Ethiopia, for the LDCs, and others, emphasized ensuring understanding of the potential consequences of policies and measures on developing country economies, and creating a system to minimize and prevent negative impacts on developing countries.",
      "The EU, with Canada, stressed that the Protocol calls for Annex I countries to strive to minimize impacts, that the objective was to figure out how best to strive through the collection and processing of information, and that such information collection would require efforts by both developed and developing countries.",
      "The G-77/China agreed with the need to deepen understanding, but also called for a system to respond to the information flow.",
      "The EU underscored that there is no consensus on building a system, that parties had agreed to look at spillover consequences of response measures, and that anything beyond this scope was a case of too high expectations.",
      "Following general discussions of scope, parties moved to line-by-line negotiations of specific paragraphs on designing policies and measures.",
      "Noting a difficulty in resolving issues, Co-Chair Ure proposed, and parties agree to, continuing discussions in an informal drafting group.",
      "On 1 October, a contact group convened to consider a non-paper resulting from discussions of the drafting group, and worked paragraph-by-paragraph through the text.",

      "Parties discussed areas of convergence and divergence in order to frame outstanding issues for further work in Barcelona.",
      "China, supported by Saudi Arabia and Argentina and opposed by Canada, introduced text stating, inter alia , that Annex I parties shall not resort to unilateral measures against imports from developing countries.",
      "Saudi Arabia stressed that this issue lies at the core of the discussions on potential consequences and that Annex I parties must not be allowed to use environmental protection as pretext to impose tariffs or trade barriers.",
      "Status of the negotiations : Co-Chair Konat\u00e9 said that the discussions and the revised text would be captured in a document to be used by the AWG-KP Chair to prepare updated documentation for Barcelona."
