      "Several parties said the decision should encompass: adoption of the 2015 agreement; interim arrangements; recognition of INDCs; guidance on implementation of the 2015 agreement; a work plan for the period 2015-2020; and budgetary and administrative matters.",
      "NORWAY added MRV and accounting systems. The G-77/CHINA stressed progressing on a draft decision on workstream 2 (pre-2020 ambition).",
      "The LDCs emphasized, with CHINA and INDIA, that work under workstream 2 must \u201cshift gears\u201d from technical examination to concrete implementation. Several members of the Umbrella Group noted their submission on elements of workstream 2, with the US identifying the role of non-state actors as an evolving element. ADP Co-Chair Djoghlaf said the Co-Chairs would report back after meeting with the Secretariat and the co-facilitators to discuss how to produce a streamlined text as requested by parties."
