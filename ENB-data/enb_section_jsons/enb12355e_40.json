      "Kunihiko Shimada, Japan, presented the group s specific recommendations that: developers should: better publicize their tools, and explain how and when they should be used; submit tools to the UNFCCC Secretariat for inclusion in the compendium; and respond to the needs of their users through user networks; UN agencies should disseminate information of importance of the NWP through their constituencies at the regional and national level, taking into account the experiences and expertise accumulated outside of the climate change communities; the UNFCCC process should encourage, support and strengthen networks; the UNFCCC should regularly update the compendium; and centers of excellence and regional centers should disseminate and conduct surveys to obtain tools and provide feedback to support updating of the UNFCCC compendium.",
      "He also elaborated on the group s general recommendations to: establish user networks to share expertise and experiences in the application of tools and methods; establish mechanisms to enable inter-comparison of methods and tools; undertake surveys on the usage of tools by parties and their constituencies; convene regular international workshops on tools and methods, in particular on the usage of the tools, including an in-session SBSTA workshop; use different formats and modes for dissemination, including: web-based seminar (Webner) and video-conferencing; webportal and web-based training; CD-ROMs; a search engine function to map tools required in regions; radio and other forms of media; printed materials such as guidebooks; and workshops; and integrate methods and tools into early planning stages at the national level, such as through the environmental impact assessment process."
