      "Much of the talk in the corridors on the meeting s opening day was focused on the act of vandalism on the Saudi Arabian name plate back in June.",
      "The topic was taken up in plenary on Monday morning, with Saudi Arabia accepting the apologies of WWF and Oxfam International, whose personnel had been identified as the perpetrators.",
      "After the plenary, many delegates complemented both Saudi Arabia s deft diplomatic handling of the issue, as well as the response of the two NGOs in sending their top representatives to Bonn to apologize in person.",
      "While most participants were relieved that the issue had been amicably resolved, there was some feeling that it had taken up too much valuable time in plenary.",
      "A few delegates were also talking about the recent decision by the US Senate not to proceed with climate legislation this year.",
      "However, the response was more muted than some had anticipated: We ve had a week or so to digest the news and at this point I m not sure what more there is to say, explained one negotiator.",
      "Meanwhile, participants in the AWG-LCA left the meeting late Monday evening clearly frustrated at the confusion over the organization of work.",
      "With so many issues on the table, it s hard to figure out how to accommodate them all in the spin-off groups, sympathized one observer.",
      "Still, it would have been nice not to spend an entire evening talking about exactly how and when we re going to talk about everything, he added."
