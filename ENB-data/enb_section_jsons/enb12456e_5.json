      "Several developed countries requested clarification on what would be addressed and noted that the text as it stands could use additional work.",
      "However, they expressed concern that such a request prejudged the decision of the COP/MOP President on how to proceed and noted the complexities entailed at this point in combining technical and political processes.",
      "Parties suggested that Chair Ashe should report to the COP/MOP plenary that the text could benefit from more technical work and that the decision rests with the COP/MOP to either allow the AWG-KP more time to work on the text or to outline another way forward.",
      "The issue was then considered in the AWG-KP closing plenary.",
      "Chair Ashe briefly outlined his consultations on the issue.",
      "He noted agreement to annex the draft texts, reflecting the latest discussions, to the report of the session and forward them to the COP/MOP.",
      "Parties also agreed that the draft text would benefit from additional work on the unresolved issues and decided to recommend to the COP/MOP that consideration be given on how to proceed with further consideration of the draft text."
