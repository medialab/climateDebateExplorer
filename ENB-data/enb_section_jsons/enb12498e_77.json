      "The SBI first considered this issue in plenary on 30 November and subsequently in a joint SBI/SBSTA contact group co-chaired by Andrew Ure (Australia) and Eduardo Calvo Buend\u00eda (Peru), which addressed both Protocol Articles 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures) and 3.14 (adverse impacts of response measures).",
      "Discussions took place in informal consultations, during which procedural draft conclusions were proposed by the co-chairs.",
      "Several parties called for substantive rather than procedural conclusions and a group of developing countries proposed a workshop relevant to Article 2.3 and 3.14.",
      "One party strongly opposed the workshop.",
      "In the final contact group meeting on 3 December, Australia said it could support the draft conclusions if the workshop was combined with one on implementation of decision 1/CP.10 (Buenos Aires Programme of Work on adaptation and response measures).",
