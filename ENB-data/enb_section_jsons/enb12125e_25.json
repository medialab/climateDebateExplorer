      "John Reilly, Associate Director for Research of the Joint Programme on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, outlined five ways that Annex B response measures may impact on non-Annex B countries: terms of trade effects, especially effects due to changes in the prices of oil, gas and coal; impacts on the volume of trade, as lower economic growth in Annex B countries translates into less demand for non-Annex B products; migration of energy-intensive production from Annex B to non-Annex B countries; economic effects of payments related to the CDM; and migration of capital and labor. He recommended: improving estimates of the relationship between the carbon price and the impact on non-Annex B countries based on advice from a panel of experts; improving modeling by using observed Annex B carbon prices as a basis for estimating the impact on non-Annex B countries; and converting various Annex B policies into a 'carbon price equivalent.",
      "' In the ensuing discussion, SAUDI ARABIA and NIGERIA cautioned that energy intensive industry may not necessarily relocate to oil exporting countries.",
      "NIGERIA stated that consumer and ethical values may create trade barriers between high and low energy intensive countries.",
      "The UK questioned the assumption that implementing climate change policies in Annex B Parties necessarily leads to reduced economic growth."
