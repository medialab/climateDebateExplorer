   "sentences": [
      "Fresh from lengthy negotiations held in September 2013 in Stockholm, Sweden, which successfully concluded IPCC Working Group I's (WGI) contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the IPCC met again on the sunny Black Sea shores of Batumi, Georgia.",
      "The need to reconvene in order to complete two methodological reports by October 2013, as requested by the UNFCCC, turned into a bit of a respite on the busy road to completing its highly anticipated AR5 assessment.",
      "This break provided the IPCC with a chance to deal with housekeeping matters that are critical to maintaining the IPCC's momentum over the coming months, and to look into the future of the IPCC's work post-AR5.",
      "The smooth progress and the constructive tone of the session allowed participants to work through the agenda at a good pace and complete their work one day early.",
      "This brief analysis puts IPCC-37 in the broader perspective of the AR5 approval process and the climate change negotiations.",
      "It also examines the important role of the newly adopted methodology reports and progress made in mapping out the future of the IPCC."
