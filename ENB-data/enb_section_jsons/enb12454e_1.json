      "PROPOSALS BY PARTIES UNDER CONVENTION ARTICLE 17 (PROTOCOLS): COP President Hedegaard said consultations had been held on how to proceed on the agenda item on proposals for new protocols under Convention Article 17. TUVALU underscored that his motives for insisting on proper consideration of this issue are sincere rather than to seek media attention.",
      "He also commended COP President Hedegaard for her personal commitment to success in Copenhagen.",
      "He said it is an irony of the modern world that we are waiting for some senators in the US Congress to conclude their discussions before we can proceed and urged President Obama to honor the Nobel Peace Prize and address the great threat to security posed by climate change. TUVALU reiterated the strong plea for two legally-binding protocols as the outcome from Copenhagen and insisted that an option to sign a legally-binding agreement in Copenhagen be put to the ministers.",
      "COP President Hedegaard said that no option will be taken off the table."
