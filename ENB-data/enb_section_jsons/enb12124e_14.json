      "Co-Chair Slade proposed a staged approach unless the issue related to the mechanisms during the commitment period or to Article 3.1 at the end of the commitment period.",
      "AUSTRALIA said a staged approach should apply to every issue and that there could be a three-month time limit for the facilitation process relating to eligibility in order to ensure timeliness.",
      "The US said the staged approach would not be applicable in all cases since the screening process may directly lead to an enforcement process.",
      "Supported by the UK, he added that only eligibility issues would go to an enforcement process, not any issue related to the mechanisms.The WORLD WILDLIFE FUND explained that other issues relating to the mechanisms were a liability system, the existence of a ceiling as well as a post-verification approach.",
      "The UK said there could be a close liaison between the two EU-proposed branches of the compliance body, including the possibility of referral from one branch to the other, and that any conclusions resulting from a compliance procedure would be in the name of the compliance body.",
      "NEW ZEALAND said the absence of a formal separation between the two branches questioned the very existence of a separation between a facilitation and an enforcement process."
