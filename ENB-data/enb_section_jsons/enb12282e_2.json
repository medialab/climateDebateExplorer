      "Richard Hosier, GEF, summarized the GEF report to the COP (FCCC/SBI/2005/3).",
      "Commenting on financial matters, the Philippines, for the G-77/CHINA, underlined 'grave concerns' on matters relating to the financial mechanism, questioning whether the GEF Council had a mandate to decide that the World Bank will be the trustee for the Adaptation Fund, or whether the World Bank consequently has the authority to establish a Multi-Donor Trust Fund to disburse funding.",
      "She also expressed concern that the new GEF Resource Allocation Framework (RAF) will not enhance transparency and could make it harder to operationalize the Adaptation Fund, and that co-financing requirements present a barrier to LDCs and SIDS accessing funds.",
      "AOSIS, with others, added that the Adaptation Fund should be administered by the COP rather than by the GEF/World Bank.",
      "BANGLADESH said the COP, and not just the GEF Council, should determine the allocation of the LDC Fund.",
      "JAPAN, opposed by TANZANIA, URUGUAY and others, said any discussion on capacity building related to the GEF report should be included under the agenda item on the financial mechanism rather than under the item on capacity building related to the Convention."
