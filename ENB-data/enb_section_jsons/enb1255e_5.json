      "The result was a mandate to launch a process toward appropriate action for the period beyond the year 2000, including strengthening of the commitments of developed countries.",
      "Delegates also reached agreement on a number of other important issues including: the establishment of a pilot phase for implementation of joint projects; the location of the Permanent Secretariat in Bonn, Germany; the budget for the Secretariat; financial procedures; and the establishment of the subsidiary bodies.",
      "Delegates, however, did not reach consensus on the rules of procedure.",
      "This critical issue, including a decision on the voting rules and the composition of the Bureau, was deferred until COP-2."
