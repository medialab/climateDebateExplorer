      "Until the 11th hour, many remained pessimistic about the potential for a deal at COP-10.",
      "The agreement on seminars was not only a victory for Argentina, but was also an important internal policy marker for some Parties.",
      "With the agreements on seminars and adaptation, and completion of land use, land-use change and forestry issues, it is safe to say that although many issues remain unresolved, much has been achieved in the past ten years.",
      "However, what has become crystal clear at COP-10 is that some Parties are not ready to embark on post-2012 negotiations.",
      "For now, the best that can be hoped for is that Annex I Parties will begin to comply with their emissions reduction commitments and implementation of Protocol mechanisms.",
      "If Annex I Parties prove that emissions reductions are possible and compatible with development, if carbon markets and/or other tools and incentives are in place so other Parties can see the benefits of participating, and if the costs of climate change impacts start to accrue significantly, the international community may be ready to take further steps in the coordinated global response to climate change."
