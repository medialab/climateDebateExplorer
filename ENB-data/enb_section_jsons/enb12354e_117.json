      "The debate on mitigation, notably the terms of engagement by developing countries, in the context of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action, was not resolved until the COP plenary on Saturday.",
      "Under the gaze of unprecedented media attention, India turned the final hours of negotiations into something approaching a Bollywood Blockbuster, with star-studded cameo roles by none other than the UN Secretary-General and the President of Indonesia, calling on parties to close a deal.",
      "Up until Saturday afternoon, the prospect of a collapse of the negotiations was not ruled out by senior participants.",
      "In a defining moment of the Conference, at the final and dramatic COP plenary session, the US stood down from its opposition to a proposal by India, supported by the G-77/China.",
      "The Indian proposal aimed to ensure that mitigation actions by developing country parties are supported by technology, financing and capacity building, subject to measurable, reportable and verifiable procedures.",
      "This new paragraph has far-reaching implications for linking developing country participation in a future agreement and confidence that they will access the means to deliver.",
      "Fired by a suspicion that developed countries had set up future negotiations that might relax their own commitments, while placing too much onus on developing country contributions, India deftly seized the momentum for the closure of a deal on the roadmap, in the full gaze of the world's media, to introduce a new rigor to the delivery of developed country commitments on capacity building.",
      "Introducing this outstanding debate into the final COP plenary on Saturday was just one of the high-risk strategies deployed to press for closure on issues that had played out for days behind closed doors.",
      "In the end, after phone calls reportedly involving Washington, the US delegation dropped its opposition to the Indian proposal, stung by rebuffs from South Africa and Papua New Guinea and lengthy applause from delegates and observers who favored the proposal.",
      "The mitigation debate was also behind contested approaches to referencing the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.",
      "This battle was fought on two fronts: under the Protocol and under the Convention.",
      "In the AWG under the Protocol, Russia, Canada, and Japan lined up to oppose a reference to the 25-40% greenhouse gas emissions reduction range in the AWG's report from Vienna, which included this and other quotes from the IPCC AR4.",
      "Noting that media coverage was feeding public expectations that countries were going to agree to reductions in this range and that we have to be careful about presenting the range as the target, the Russian Federation continued its opposition all the way to the AWG closing plenary.",
      "Canada and Japan, which had argued in the informal consultations that Russia should be heeded, changed their position after a concerted campaign by AOSIS to insert a comprehensive reference to the IPCC AR4.",
      "There was less success on the Convention front in the Dialogue on Cooperative Action, where the reference to the IPCC science is weaker. AOSIS was unable to summon up the support for a stronger reference when negotiators met in a small informal group to close on this issue.",
      "Participants believe that this will be a weaker starting point for negotiations on cooperative action under the Convention, and the IPCC references may have to be revisited."
