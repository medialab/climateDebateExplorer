      "In its decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2007/L.23/Add.1/Rev.1), the COP, inter alia : affirms the urgent need to take further meaningful action to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; encourages parties to explore a range of actions and undertake efforts, including demonstration activities, to address the drivers of deforestation, with a view to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and thus enhancing forest carbon stocks due to sustainable management of forests ; requests the SBSTA to undertake a programme of work on methodological issues related to a range of policy approaches and positive incentives, including through submissions and the organization of a workshop, and to report to COP 14 on the outcomes of this work; and notes the further consideration, under the Bali roadmap, of policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries."
