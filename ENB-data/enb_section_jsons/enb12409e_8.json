      "Emphasizing agriculture as a strategic sector linking adaptation and mitigation, Louis Bockel, UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), presented on increasing the economic resilience of the agricultural sector.",
      "Regarding policy targets at the country level, he suggested: consolidating the resilience of cropping systems, as well as of watersheds and infrastructure, to natural disasters; and diversifying rural income and strengthening the resilience of vulnerable households.",
      "He also called for scaling up by enhancing the poverty reduction potential of payment for environmental services and for productive socio-environmental safety nets.",
      "Aaron Oxley, MicroEnsure, discussed weather index insurance, which covers weather-related risks such as drought and excess rain, and is affordable for small farmers.",
      "He said the data is relevant to small farmers actual situation given that rainfall measurements are taken at nearby weather stations, within 20 km of farms.",
      "He explained that weather index insurance is usually offered through local cooperatives, input dealers, microfinance institutions or banks, and is a powerful tool for unlocking rural credit, increasing farm inputs and investment, and improving livelihoods.",
      "He highlighted some prerequisites for success, including the need for a competent local manager, adequate weather infrastructure, real time meteorological data, and supportive regulators who understand the product.",
      "Marjorie Victor, Oxfam, presented on the Horn of Africa Risk Transfer for Adaptation (HARITA) pilot project for weather index microinsurance in Ethiopia.",
      "She explained that HARITA is demand-driven, adopts a holistic approach to risk management, and involves local to global partners and advisors.",
      "She described the functioning of the project, highlighting that farmers carry out risk reduction labor in exchange for a weather insurance voucher.",
      "During the ensuing discussion, participants addressed, inter alia , ways of combining risk reduction and risk transfer, transaction costs, the importance of climate data, and the need for an international and national insurance pool.",
      "They also stressed the importance of integrating sustainable land management practices and their role in bringing down the cost of insurance.",
      "Oxley recalled the difference between microinsurance and social protection, noting the inadequacy of microinsurance in cases of chronic or lasting disasters, and Victor elaborated on project sustainability as a result of linking with strong local institutions, the government and the private sector."
