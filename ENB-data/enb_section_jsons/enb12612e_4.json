      "The theme of intergenerational equity marked day four of COP 20.",
      "Youth actions, such as 'The Planet Cannot Wait', sought to remind delegates they are expected to 'show the world' that 'something good can work'.",
      "As the meeting agenda grew increasingly busy, those who found time between contact groups and informal consultations to read the news from the world outside the 'Pentagonito' complex received stark reminders of the urgency of action, with newspaper headlines warning that in 30 years from now Kiribati will disappear underwater and describing 2014 as the hottest year on record globally.",
      "Despite a full day of negotiations under the ADP, delegates were left with mixed feelings on progress.",
      "One participant observed 'this COP seems so relaxed I am not sure what - if anything - will come out of it'.",
      "Many others were visibly pleased with finally having 'textual suggestions' on the screen in the ADP contact group on the draft decision on advancing the ADP, and finishing a first reading of twelve paragraphs.",
      "Others wondered if delegates would be able to stick to their ambitious plan to conduct a first full reading of the 12-page Co-Chairs' draft text by Friday evening.",
      "'This is an unmitigated disaster in the making - much like the one for my island', one delegate intimated."
