      "Late on Wednesday afternoon, participants considered constraints and gaps, and related financial, technical and capacity needs relevant to the preparation of second national communications. Philip Weech, UNFCCC Secretariat, observed that, as part of their national communications, non-Annex I Parties are required to provide a list of projects that they are proposing for financing.",
      "He noted that, although such lists were included in the first national communications by many non-Annex I Parties, the proposals had not yet been considered for funding.",
      "He said the Secretariat is working on a paper for consideration at COP-10, to address the issue of project funding under non-Annex I national communications.",
      "Weech then informed participants on the process of submitting national communications, pointing out that they should be in one of the UN languages, and should include an executive summary.",
      "Additional supporting information can be added as technical annexes. A general discussion ensued, during which a representative of the WMO emphasized the need for non-Annex I Parties to maintain inventories of experts and resource people trained in preparing national communications."
