      "Delegates came down to earth Wednesday as the euphoria with the success on compliance turned to frustration over Article 7.4 and other mechanisms issues.",
      "One issue apparently of concern to some delegates was the fact that the actual text on Article 7.4 had not been made available during high-level consultations.",
      "However, others suggested this might be an effective strategy at this point in time.",
      "Meanwhile, reinstatement of eligibility requirements emerged as a key area of controversy, as the issue, which already was a fundamental element of the compliance package deal, was taken up in talks on Articles 5, 7 and 8.",
