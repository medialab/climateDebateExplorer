      "Argentina, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed the need for developed countries to put forward ambitious quantified emission reduction commitments under the AWG-KP and lamented that current pledges are insufficient.",
      "Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, said pledges and actions from Copenhagen and Cancun should set the groundwork for future efforts.",
      "Switzerland, for the EIG, urged agreement on LULUCF accounting rules, flexible mechanisms, length of commitment period after 2012, transformation of pledges into QELROs and the basket of gases.",
      "Contingent on an agreement to develop a new legally-binding framework engaging all parties, the EU said he is open to a second commitment period, which should end by 2020.",
      "The AFRICAN GROUP, G-77/CHINA, AOSIS and LDCs urged a second commitment period.",
      "The AFRICAN GROUP added that carbon markets would collapse without an agreement, and said African soil should not become the Protocol s graveyard. AOSIS said a credible outcome in Durban must consist of: a second commitment period of no longer than five years; ratifiable amendments to the Protocol and its Annex B; binding commitments in the form of QELROs; closing loopholes in LULUCF accounting rules; and increased mitigation ambitions by Annex I Parties.",
      "The Gambia, for LDCs, supported by AOSIS, said those aiming to leave the Kyoto Protocol are not doing so because they want to do more, but because they want to do less.",
      "She urged the elimination of loopholes such as carryover of surplus AAUs and in accounting rules for LULUCF. SPAIN reported on an informal meeting jointly organized with Mexico and South Africa to discuss the legal form of the AWG-LCA outcome.",
      "She highlighted that progress on the legal form is a key part of a balanced package in Durban for a number of Annex I parties, building on the Bali Action Plan, the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Cancun Agreements . BINGOs called for clear and positive signals in Durban on the climate change structure to encourage the private sector to keep investing in clean development.",
      "ENGOs called for closing loopholes, such as in LULUCF rules. INDIGENOUS PEOPLES supported strengthening the Kyoto Protocol provisions and developing alternatives to market mechanisms for adaptation and mitigation funding."
