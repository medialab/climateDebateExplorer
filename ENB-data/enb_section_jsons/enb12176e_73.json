      "Clarifying the nature and scope of the Kyoto mechanisms has always been one of the key determinants for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by Annex I Parties.",
      "Although delegates were unable to resolve all of the technical issues and produce a clean text, they nevertheless laid a solid foundation for a positive outcome at COP-7.",
      "Key to this was the political agreement that was reached on the identified 'core issues,' including supplementarity, eligibility, share of proceeds, the composition of the executive board, and sinks and nuclear facilities in the CDM.",
      "Agreement was also reached on technical issues such as baselines and additionality, small-scale CDM project activities, environmental impact assessments, public participation, and review by the executive board.",
      "As with a number of the other key issues, the EU made several important compromises on its previously stated positions, most notably on sinks.",
      "While they may seek some solace in the text on nuclear facilities, and parts of the text on eligibility requirements, it is evident that the desire to ensure the participation of key Umbrella Group countries greatly outweighed their aspirations for a stronger Protocol."
