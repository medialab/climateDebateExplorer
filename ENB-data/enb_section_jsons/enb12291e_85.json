      "In the final decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/L.5), the COP/MOP 'approves and adopts' the compliance mechanism without prejudice to the outcome of the amendment process.",
      "It requests SBI 24 to commence consideration of an amendment to the Protocol and report to COP/MOP 3, which will make a decision on the issue.",
      "The procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance adopted and annexed to the COP/MOP decision are the same as in the annex to Decision 24/CP.7. The annex establishes a 20-member compliance committee with a plenary, bureau, and facilitative and enforcement branches.",
      "The plenary\u0092s main functions are administrative and budgetary.",
      "The decision outlines the compliance committee\u0092s procedures, including an appeal to the COP/MOP for due process reasons.",
      "It defines an 'additional period for fulfilling commitments' after the end of the first commitment period. The facilitative branch is responsible for promoting compliance, providing implementation advice and facilitation taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.",
      "Consequences applied by the facilitative branch include advice and facilitation of financial and technical assistance. The enforcement branch receives questions of implementation from expert review teams, and from parties regarding themselves or other parties.",
      "It determines whether a party is complying with its quantitative emissions reduction commitments, methodological and reporting requirements, and the eligibility criteria for the flexible mechanisms. The enforcement branch may make a declaration of non-compliance and request a party to develop a plan analyzing the causes and indicating measures and timetable for remedying non-compliance.",
      "It may also suspend mechanism eligibility if a party does not fulfill the eligibility criteria or has exceeded its assigned amount.",
      "If a party\u0092s emissions exceed its assigned amount, its assigned amount for the second commitment period will be deducted by 1.3 times the amount of excess tonnes."
