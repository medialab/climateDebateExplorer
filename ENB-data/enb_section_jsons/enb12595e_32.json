      "'To reach a port we must set sail ' Sail, not tie at anchor Sail, not drift'.",
      "Franklin D. Roosevelt Delegates converged in Bonn for the first official UNFCCC climate talks of 2014 with the promise of spring in the air.",
      "However, with the marathon Warsaw COP still fresh on their minds, many acknowledged that there will be choppy waters to navigate during the year.",
      "Pressure is on the ADP to fulfill its mandate: to develop a new legal instrument under the Convention applicable to all parties by 2015 to come into effect in 2020; and to close the pre-2020 ambition gap.",
      "Delegates realized the need to get down to the business of identifying elements for the new agreement and bringing views closer together ahead of the 'make or break' COP in Paris next year.",
      "This being said, expectations in Bonn were muted.",
      "Many saw ADP 2-4 as a fairly 'low profile event', more of an opportunity to 'soften positions before getting into negotiating mode later this year'.",
      "While some delegates lamented the slow progress, the meeting did define the landscape on nationally determined contributions and agreed to constitute a contact group to start negotiating text at its next session in June.",
      "This brief analysis will examine the meeting in the context of process and progress and draw out implications for the negotiations as they sail towards COP 20 in Lima, Peru, in December 2014, and ultimately COP 21 in Paris, France, in 2015."
