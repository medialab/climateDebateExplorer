   "sentences": [
      "A proposal by the Russian Federation on voluntary commitments was first made during COP/MOP 1 in Montreal in December 2005, during the discussions on the Article 3.9 of the Kyoto Protocol, which concerns future commitments for Annex I parties.",
      "The discussions on Article 3.9 in Montreal resulted in the establishment of the AWG, and the Russian Federation proposed that the AWG should be mandated to develop appropriate procedures for the approval of voluntary commitments.",
      "At COP/MOP 1 , parties requested the COP/MOP President to hold consultations on how to address this issue and report back at COP/MOP 2 .",
      "After a lengthy agenda dispute at COP/MOP 2 , where the substance of the Russian proposal was not discussed, parties requested the President to hold an informal workshop during SB 26 to clarify and explore the scope and implications of the proposal by the Russian Federation and to prepare a report, on his own responsibility, on the proceedings and main points raised at this workshop (FCCC/KP/CMP/2006/10, paragraphs 98-102).",
      "This workshop was held on Friday, 11 May, and was facilitated by Michael Zammit Cutajar (Malta) on behalf of COP/MOP 2 President Kivutha Kibwana, who was unable to attend.",
      "The workshop involved a detailed elaboration by the Russian Federation on its proposal, which consists of a two-track approach characterized as Kyoto and Convention tracks, with the Kyoto track relating to simplified procedures to allow parties to join Annex I and Annex B, while the Convention track would support national voluntary commitments by developing countries that could be recognized under the Convention.",
      "Many parties participated in this discussion, with many expressing positive views on the Kyoto track.",
      "A number of developing countries expressed opposition or concerns to the Convention track proposals, while developed countries for the most part welcomed the opportunity to discuss the proposal.",
