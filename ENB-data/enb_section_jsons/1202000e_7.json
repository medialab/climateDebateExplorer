      "On Monday, delegates agreed that AOSIS could present its draft protocol to the Committee on Wednesday.",
      "This protocol, which calls for a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 20% by the year 2005, has been the subject of discussion in the corridors and during the intersessional period.",
      "It appears as though an agreement has been reached whereupon there will be no negotiation of this protocol until the COP.",
      "Although the Chair made the point that the protocol might be discussed during Working Group I\u0092s review of the adequacy of commitments on Wednesday afternoon, few expect much progress at this session."
