      "There are few expectations that Parties will emerge from the COP/MOP with a 'Montreal Mandate' (as mooted by South Africa at the SOGE), that actually establishes the post-2012 framework.",
      "However, at the very least, it is anticipated that no options will be foreclosed.",
      "On the fringes of SB 22, the EU and AOSIS met with the Canadian Presidency to discuss the possibility of reintroducing the so called 'Estrada Approach' to trigger a COP/MOP discussion on post-2012.",
      "This would see the Presidency introducing an agenda item on the matter. Key issues for the COP/MOP that will help shape the quality of the outcome - and determine confidence in the future of the process - will be the establishment of a Compliance Committee and the upgrading of work on adaptation."
