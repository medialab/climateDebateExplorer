      "On Tuesday morning, WG I Co-Chairs Thomas Stocker (Switzerland) and Dahe Qin (China) opened the 11th session of WG I.",
      "Chair Pachauri reminded delegates that, in addition to updating the state of scientific knowledge, the AR5 should fill gaps in understanding and include regional detail.",
      "Co-Chair Stocker presented the current state of the outline (WG-I: 10th/Docs.2 and 3, and Inf.1), highlighting the four pillars of the report: near-term climate change, long-term projections, climate phenomena across time-scales and an atlas of global and regional climate projections.",
      "Co-Chair Stocker then opened the floor for general questions, including: ordering of integration chapters; joint work between WGs I and III; modeling of regional climate phenomena and subregional modeling to capture small scale variability; coastal processes; the regional atlas and whether this information will also be in the relevant chapters; and consistent treatment of uncertainty, using calibrated language from the AR4.",
      "Norway, supported by Germany and Sweden, asked for the inclusion of air pollution.",
      "South Africa raised concern about gaps in observational systems records, to which Co-Chair Stocker responded that it will be addressed in the Introduction to the WG I report and Technical Summary as a wider contextual issue.",
      "Parties were reminded by Co-Chair Stocker that the bullets under the chapter headings are not meant to be sub-headings, but rather to provide guidance for authors.",
      "The delegates then went through the WG I outline chapter by chapter, addressing both chapter headings and the specific bullets under each chapter heading.",
      "On Chapter 2 on Observations: atmosphere and surface, the UK requested the inclusion of changes in soil temperature and moisture.",
      "Many delegates supported a section on atmospheric composition to ensure an early reference in the report to observed greenhouse gases.",
      "Belgium, Spain and Indonesia called for including wind speeds in the bullet on atmospheric circulation to highlight the importance of this data for the wind energy industry.",
      "The US requested inclusion of trace gases.",
      "The chapter outline was agreed with an amendment to add a section on changes in atmospheric composition, adding wind to the bullet on atmospheric circulation, and adding soil temperature to the bullet on surface temperature.",
      "The outline for Chapter 4 on Observations: cryosphere, was approved with an amendment to add sea ice to the bullet on dynamics of ice sheets, ice shelves, ice caps and glaciers to address parties concerns that the topic was not included elsewhere.",
      "On Chapter 6 on Carbon and other biogeochemical cycles, Co-Chair Stocker noted that this topic was last addressed in the TAR and that the aim here was to emphasize the new literature on the carbon cycle, its feedbacks and interaction with other cycles.",
      "On Chapter 7 on Clouds and aerosols, Co-Chair Stocker noted that the time is mature for this topic to have its own dedicated chapter.",
      "China s proposal to delete the specific reference to black carbon was met with strong opposition from the US, UK, Austria and Canada.",
      "The US proposed addressing black carbon in a sub-chapter.",
      "Canada said the policy action is far ahead of the science on this issue, stressing the need for authoritative science on black carbon.",
      "China agreed to keep the original reference, stating that they appreciate the need for an assessment of black carbon but noted that many aerosols also play an important role.",
      "The UK suggested adding a bullet on contrails and cosmic rays to improve the understanding of policymakers on these issues.",
      "A small group drafted language to add these two issues to the bullet on direct and indirect aerosol forcing and effects, which was agreed.",
      "On Chapter 9 on Evaluation of climate models, delegates discussed how best to capture ideas on the range of models, downscaling methods, the strengths and weaknesses of ensembles, and couplings.",
      "On Chapter 11 on Near-term climate change: projections and predictability, delegates made a number of interventions on using the word prediction versus projections and air pollution versus air quality.",
      "The Panel agreed to keep the original formulation of projections, to recognize the limitations in prediction and understanding of uncertainty, and air quality, as a broader term, which includes air pollution.",
      "Other discussions centered on definitions of near and long-term time horizons, and on adding climate hotspots, such as the Mediterranean, to the bullet on regional climate change, variability and extremes.",
      "On Chapter 13 on Sea level change, Co-Chair Stocker noted that this chapter was last addressed in the TAR and is meant as a response to the important developments on this issue just after the AR4.",
      "Delegates discussed inferences from the paleo-climate record, resulting in the amendment of the first bullet to mention past instead of observed sea level change.",
      "All other chapter outlines were approved without amendment.",
      "Co-Chair Stocker then introduced a proposed new Annex I to the WG I report containing an atlas of global and regional climate projections, noting that this will be a new product intended as a flexible and interactive electronic device in addition to the hard-copy report.",
      "He clarified that the editorial team would include the Coordinating Lead Authors of Chapter 11 on near-term climate change projections and Chapter 12 on long-term climate-change projections, to which Belgium suggested, and it was agreed, that Coordinating Lead Authors for Chapter 14 on climate phenomena should also be included.",
      "The US and the UK were concerned that there is currently no formal review of the atlas and delegates decided that this would be taken up in the plenary session.",
      "On the ongoing work of the WG, the Netherlands noted the need for coordination with WGs II and III, and Australia called for inclusion of the issue of waves in the scope of the workshop on sea level and ice sheet stability to be held in June 2010 in Malaysia, in conjunction with the World Climate Research Programme.",
      "In the closing of the session on Wednesday, Co-Chair Stocker said that the next WG session would take place in September 2011 to approve the Summary of the Special Report on extreme events and disasters."
