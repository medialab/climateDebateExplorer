      "Of the 10,000 participants in the Bali Conference, it is likely only a handful of them had a meaningful grasp of all the pieces that now make up the deepening complexity of the climate change regime.",
      "Delegates in Bali had to balance meetings of the UNFCCC COP and the Kyoto Protocol COP/MOP, along with the subsidiary bodies, the Ad Hoc Working Group, dozens of contact groups and informal consultations on issues ranging from budgets to national reporting to reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries, not to mention side events held by governments, international organizations, business and industry, and environmental NGOs.",
      "Balancing the large number of participants, issues and negotiating venues requires stamina, time management and a lot of creativity.",
      "With the launch of new negotiations on a long-term agreement, which, by definition must be more ambitious than anything that has gone before, yet another piece has been added to the ever-growing complex puzzle that makes up the climate regime.",
      "Managing this deepening complexity in a highly sensitive - and largely transparent - political environment has become an extraordinary feat, undertaken by a UNFCCC Secretariat that continues to impress participants with a combination of professionalism, competence and good humor.",
      "The UN Secretary-General's decision to adopt climate change as one of his own UN system-wide priorities, with a more effective division of labor and lines of accountability on climate-related issues throughout the UN system, will shore up the resources required for the future.",
      "A greater emphasis on the need to draw on expertise found outside the immediate UNFCCC process was also a notable and timely feature of discussions in Bali.",
      "Nevertheless, the challenge of defining precisely what elements of the Bali decisions and outcomes constitute the Bali roadmap is its own complex work in progress.",
      "For example, what exactly is the nature of the agreement that must result from the Bali roadmap?",
      "This is still a matter of debate, with divergent views on the legal form or architecture that will accommodate and, perhaps elaborate, existing commitments under the Convention and the Protocol in the near term and after 2012.",
      "So, while the Bali roadmap was never categorically defined, most are viewing it as a compendium of decisions and processes adopted and launched by the COP and COP/MOP, which can be divided into three types: Negotiating tracks; Building blocks; and Supporting activities, including reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation."
