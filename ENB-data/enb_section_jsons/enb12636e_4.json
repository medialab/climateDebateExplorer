Responding to calls by China, for the G-77/CHINA, with other developing countries, to clarify developed countries\u2019 views on how to fill existing gaps in capacity building, the US identified the TEC, CTCN and the Climate Technology Initiative Private Financing Advisory Network. Countries debated whether the CTCN could become the capacity-building mechanism for the new agreement.",
