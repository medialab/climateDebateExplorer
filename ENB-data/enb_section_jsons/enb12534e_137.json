      "Only free men can negotiate.",
      "Your freedom and mine cannot be separated.",
      "Nelson Mandela Critically, in a deeply complex mix of issues, with essential and constructed linkages across the package there was an onus on the Presidency to draw on all available talent and experience to line up the interdependent chain of deliverables with clarity and dexterity.",
      "Even as late as Thursday evening, anxiety was rising and, in the wee hours of Friday morning, a relatively closed high-level Indaba of 26 parties representing the major negotiating groups began to hammer out the final terms of a deal.",
      "This was also helped by a parallel set of ministerial-led facilitations and bilateral meetings to seek common ground.",
      "It took a critical engagement between the EU, AOSIS and LDCs to really inject a sense of direction and pace into the negotiations as the countdown to the end of the Conference began.",
      "There was a palpable shift in the atmospherics after EU Commissioner Hedegaard joined with AOSIS and the LDCs in issuing a public statement backing the EU roadmap plan linking the second commitment period to the early launch of new negotiations under the Convention.",
      "As news of the Commissioner s battle behind closed doors emerged, there was an extra spring in the step of European negotiators as Hedegaard s brinkmanship in Durban drew stark comparisons with Copenhagen where the Europeans had found themselves isolated and out on a limb in their attempts to lead from the front and champion a second commitment period.",
      "But gaining support of AOSIS and the LDCs was not enough.",
      "It was deemed essential that the EU assure China and India that they would simply be expected to turn their Cancun pledges into new legal arrangements.",
      "As one observer noted, the 2020 timeframe for any future instrument under the Convention was a source of some reassurance to BASIC countries that their Cancun pledges and their timeframes would be acceptable.",
      "The Presidency and the EU were able to lock in the relatively constructive role of countries such as Brazil.",
      "While China seemed content to allow India to do BASIC s heavy lifting and profile the equity issue, an issue- alongside common but differentiated responsibilities- that has helped define the contest over contemporary rights to development and the debate over mitigation commitments.",
      "Equity will come to the fore in the negotiation of a new instrument as the distribution and pace of mitigation responsibilities increasingly mirrors a debate on access to ecological space, driven by an ethical demand from the least developed and most vulnerable that the world must overcome a form of atmospheric apartheid wherein the glittering prizes of development have- to date- been heavily concentrated in the hands of the few.",
      "It s a demand that also finds an echo in popular protests in response to the crisis-prone global financial system.",
      "An intriguing decision recognizing loss and damage also points to the future prominence of the equity debate.",
      "The EU concession to BASIC countries on allowing any new instrument under the Convention to be implemented from 2020 drew fire from its AOSIS allies and environmental NGOs, some of whom have severely criticized the Durban Platform.",
      "While there was some compensation in the final package under the 2013-2015 Review to enhance mitigation ambition, they are still concerned that this will be too little too late.",
      "With complex issues and strains on even the most natural alliances there was an onus on the Presidency to weigh in and offer reassurance as one party s interdependence sometimes became another s unacceptable price.",
      "At the outset some observers wondered how the South African Presidency would respond to the competing loyalties to BASIC and the African Union.",
      "On the one hand, and significantly, BASIC spoke in plenary for the first time ever as a united negotiating group.",
      "On the other, the Presidency inevitably sought to align the potential wins in Durban with their leadership role on the African continent.",
      "Determined that the Kyoto Protocol would not be buried in African soil, the African hosts sought to capitalize on the quid pro quo of a second commitment period and a renewed, science-led, determination to close the mitigation gap by pressing home their advantage in the form of closure on the Green Climate Fund, arrangements for the Adaptation Committee, and new technology capacity.",
      "Although there was enough political ground to secure a deal, it was not until the final moments on the floor of the plenary that the ultimate deal fell into place.",
      "Described as a defining moment, a last-minute huddle on the plenary floor- perhaps the most authentic of all the Indabas- in the early hours of Sunday morning enabled the EU to reach a compromise with India on an option to describe the new UNFCCC instrument in acceptable legal terms.",
      "At the eleventh hour, they agreed to launch a process to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties.",
      "It is an issue that could come back to haunt the Europeans who might well discover with the passage of time just how big a compromise they made to India, if other countries choose to construct an escape hatch around the legal terminology that falls short of a new protocol."
