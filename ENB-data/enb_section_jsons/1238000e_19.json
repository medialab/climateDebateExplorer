      "The decision on communications from non-Annex I Parties (FCCC/CP/1996/L.12) was drafted with input from the SBSTA.",
      "During the SBI regular session, several developing country delegations objected to language in the Secretariat\u0092s draft that called on non-Annex I countries to include information on GHG mitigation measures in their national communications.",
      "This matter was resolved in a contact group. The decision adopted by the Plenary requests the Secretariat to facilitate assistance to non-Annex I Parties in the preparation of their first national communications through regional workshops and other fora.",
      "The decision incorporates an annex with guidelines for preparation of initial communications, and determines that national and regional development priorities should be taken into account by the COP in considering initial communications.",
      "Parties wishing to volunteer more information are to use national reporting guidelines for Annex I Parties. Guidelines for communications from non-Annex I Parties require the following: a national inventory of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all GHGs; a general description of steps to implement the FCCC; and other information relevant to calculation of global emission trends."
