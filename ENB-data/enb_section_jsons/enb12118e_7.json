      "Delegates considered the project cycle of the CDM.",
      "The G-77/CHINA stressed the need to address the CDM's driving force, nature and scope.",
      "AUSTRALIA said the CDM should be largely private sector driven.",
      "He added that investors needed to know that credits will be forthcoming. Several Parties agreed that the host country is the best judge of its sustainable development needs.",
      "NORWAY inquired about the role of operational entities in the validation and pre-registration of project proposals, noting that the Executive Board may not be able to carry out this task. SOUTH AFRICA, the SUDAN, BOLIVIA, MEXICO and MAURITANIA suggested that the CDM include the concept of emissions avoidance.",
      "BOLIVIA proposed including forest protection initiatives under emissions avoidance.",
      "MEXICO said he looked forward to using the CDM to supplement national efforts to shift from slash-and-burn techniques, which are responsible for loss of forest cover, to sustainable technologies that would have a positive impact on climate change.",
      "MAURITANIA objected to the inclusion of forest protection within the CDM, as Parties would seek to protect their forests regardless of its inclusion.",
      "IRAN said the CDM should include projects related to both sinks and sources.",
      "On the issue of baselines for emissions avoidance projects, NEW ZEALAND suggested that, to minimize transaction costs, the commercial contract-bidding process should be used to identify the baseline.",
      "The EU said the baselines should be determined on a project-by- project basis. SWITZERLAND said that in considering the types of projects that are eligible, possible negative spillover effects into other multilateral domains should be taken into consideration.",
      "MOROCCO stressed the need to certify that reduced or avoided emissions are real, measurable and contribute to sustainable development in the host country.",
      "With SWITZERLAND, she said CDM projects should be subjected to rigorous impact assessment studies that take into account the socio-economic aspects of the host country. On the financing of CDM projects, Chair Chow (Malaysia) queried whether the funding will be bilateral, multilateral or unilateral; if ODA and the FCCC's financial mechanisms could fund CDM activities; or if CDM funds will be managed by the Executive Board, so as to ensure equitable distribution.",
      "MAURITANIA asked how transparency of and accountability for the investment will be ensured. On unilateral funding of CDM projects, JAPAN asked whether unilaterally-funded projects were consistent with the concept of CDM.",
      "The REPUBLIC OF KOREA said unilateral funding for CDM would provide incentives for non-Annex I Parties to implement measures to reduce GHGs.",
      "COLOMBIA highlighted the potential of indigenous private sector projects.",
      "He said that as long as CDM projects demonstrate additionality and lead to real and measurable long- term reductions, there should be flexibility in financing the projects.",
      "On unilateral CDM, NEW ZEALAND noted that additionality would require careful judgments. Regarding the use of ODA and GEF funds, the EU said CDM funding should not compete with these sources but that we would be open to discussion of all options as long as conditions for validation and certification are met.",
      "The G-77/CHINA emphasized that CDM funding should be over and above ODA, GEF and other financial commitments.",
      "JAPAN said there were no provisions requiring financial additionality and none that preclude the use of ODA as a source of funding.",
      "He said the CDM should be mainly funded by the private sector.",
      "The G-77/CHINA said funding additionality flows from the fact that the purpose of the CDM is to assist Annex I Parties in attaining their commitments"
