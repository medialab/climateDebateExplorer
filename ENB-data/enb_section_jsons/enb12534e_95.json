      "This issue was addressed throughout the week in a contact group facilitated by George Wamukoya (Kenya).",
      "Based on the facilitator s note from Panama, parties focused discussion on three main areas of the text: the general framework, agriculture, and international aviation and maritime transport.",
      "Parties views diverged on the language contained in, and possible need for, a general framework, and the extent to which it should detail language on agriculture and bunker fuels.",
      "Discussions addressed how the application of common but differentiated responsibilities across sectors is both a legal and a political issue, upon which guidance must be provided and must therefore be taken up by Ministers.",
      "On agriculture, parties considered food security, trade, and economic development and poverty eradication.",
      "Some developed countries emphasized the relevance of a SBSTA programme of work on agriculture.",
      "On bunker fuels, divergent views were expressed on, inter alia : the scope of measures, principles and directed guidance for the work of ICAO and IMO, ambition of action, and market-based instruments.",
      "However, there was broad agreement on defining a role for ICAO and IMO to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation and maritime transport, respectively."
