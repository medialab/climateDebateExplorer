      "The non-group on policies and measures met in the morning to consider a draft text proposed by the Chair containing two alternatives.",
      "In one, commitments would be fulfilled individually.",
      "The other allows for the possibility of common/coordinated policies and measures.",
      "An initial exchange of views took place on the text, and some amendments were made to the second alternative.",
      "In general, delegations noted the considerable difference between the two alternatives in terms of content.",
      "Some delegations suggested that the solution to this would be the inclusion of an intermediate alternative. A group of countries requested that a proposal it had presented previously as a non-paper be included in the draft as a third alternative.",
      "Several delegations objected to this and indicated that the proposal had been duly reflected under the second alternative.",
      "Other delegations also regretted not seeing their proposals included in the text.",
      "One of the proposals pertained to guidelines for P&Ms, while others referred to national action plans and performance indicators. To allow the inclusion of proposals of a differing nature under the same alternative, the title of the section was changed to a more general one on 'Policies and Measures.",
      "' On the second alternative, a delegation said that while coordinated action should not be excluded, it should not be mandated either.",
      "Several delegations suggested changing the framework and structure of this alternative.",
      "A group of countries suggested that some principles and guidelines should frame the section on policies and measures. A group of countries noted the need to change the first two paragraphs under the second alternative on policies and measures to better reflect the proposals upon which they were based.",
      "There was a discussion on whether a reference to a subset of Parties under Annex I should be included in the paragraph on cooperation to establish coordinated cross-sectoral, cost-effective policy instruments.",
      "In the afternoon, delegations engaged in informal consultations on how differing proposals were to be included under the same alternative. In the evening hours, the non-group reconvened and was presented with two new documents by the Chair on general provisions and alternatives for policies and measures. The document on alternatives for policies and measures, refers to the types of P&Ms that countries listed in an 'Annex Q' shall adopt or give priority to.",
      "Types of policies and measures have been classified under different lists (A, B and C).",
      "It was agreed that paragraphs on voluntary policies and measures would be deleted, and that P&Ms under list B would be 'coordinated' instead of 'specific'. Regarding the document on general provisions, a proposal was made to replace paragraphs in the text on the development of national plans for the limitation and reduction of anthropogenic emissions by sources and the incremental rate of removal by sinks.",
      "A paragraph was included on the discretion Parties shall have to select those policies and measures that are best suited to national circumstances for meeting their emission limitation and reduction commitments.",
      "It was agreed that the Chair would present the AGBM plenary a revised draft text, based on the discussions of the non-group."
