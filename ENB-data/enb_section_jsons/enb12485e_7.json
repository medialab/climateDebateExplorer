      "The Tianjin Climate Change Talks opened on Monday morning, 4 October 2010.",
      "Huang Xingguo, Mayor of Tianjin, welcomed participants to Tianjin, which he described as China s model for developing a circular economy.",
      "He said the meeting is an illustration of China s efforts to implement the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Bali Roadmap. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres emphasized the need to prevent multilateralism from being seen as an endless road and also urged parties to prevent climate change impacts from erasing development progress.",
      "She said a set of decisions by the Conference of the Parties (COP) and Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP) could be an achievable outcome in Cancun, which could include adaptation and technology transfer frameworks, capacity building, a financial mechanism and the launch of a readiness phase for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD).",
      "She stressed that these issues cannot advance without clarity on sensitive political issues, including fast-start finance, the future of the Kyoto Protocol, formalization of previous commitments made by parties, long-term finance, response measures and an understanding of fairness to guide long-term work.",
      "Dai Bingguo, State Councilor, China, called for countries to reach consensus on a legally-binding agreement at an early date.",
      "He highlighted China s mitigation targets and suggested that parties: adhere to the UNFCCC framework and build on the outcomes of the Copenhagen Conference to promote the implementation of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol; follow the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities; and strike a balance between economic development, poverty eradication and climate protection."
