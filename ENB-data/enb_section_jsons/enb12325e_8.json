      "In this contact group, Co-Chair Krug noted divergent views as presented in submissions and plenary statements, and invited general comments on changes to the limit for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities.",
      "Recalling that the decision on small-scale afforestation and reforestation in the CDM was only taken at COP 10, BRAZIL said it was premature to discuss a change in the limit and, with AUSTRALIA, the EU and others, noted market-related problems due to economies of scale and not necessarily the CDM.",
      "BOLIVIA, CHILE and MALAYSIA agreed that size was not the only problem, but believed there was enough experience concerning difficulties with developing projects to merit a revision of the limit.",
      "Tuvalu, for AOSIS, with the EU, stressed that the decision on small-scale afforestation and reforestation projects was part of a balanced package agreed at COP 9.",
      "They opposed opening the discussion but agreed on establishing an analytical process to understand barriers to implementation.",
      "CANADA recalled that discussions at COP 9 did not include a calculation of the implications of the tonnage limit and suggested that the CDM Executive Board could undertake a revision.",
      "JAPAN, opposed by BRAZIL, supported addressing simplified modalities.",
      "CHINA and INDIA opposed an increase of the threshold.",
      "Co-Chairs' draft conclusions will be made available on Thursday morning prior to the resumption of informal discussions."
