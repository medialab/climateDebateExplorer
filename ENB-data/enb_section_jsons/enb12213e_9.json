      "Co-Chair Thelma Krug called attention to the proposed insurance and temporary units approaches for addressing non-permanence.",

      "AOSIS reminded delegates that the modalities under discussion are to apply in the first commitment period only, and, with the EU, said that it did not support a stand-alone insurance approach.",
      "The EU said that Canada\u0092s insurance policies approach does not fully address non-permanence because insurance can expire as early as ten years after the end of the crediting period.",
      "Co-Chair Krug said an informal drafting group on non-permanence would be convened."
