      "The development and transfer of technologies was first addressed at SBSTA 22 in plenary on Thursday, 19 May.",
      "A contact group co-chaired by William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) and Holger Liptow (Germany) was convened.",
      "The group met twice formally, and numerous times informally, to agree on draft conclusions, which include terms of reference for the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT).",
      "These conclusions were adopted by SBSTA 22. During the SBSTA plenary, EGTT Chair Kishan Kummarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) presented the EGTT\u0092s most recent report.",
      "Malaysia, for the G-77/China, underscored the importance of meeting the needs identified in the technological needs assessments (TNAs), and asked for a full review of implementation of COP decisions related to technology transfer since COP 1.",
      "The Umbrella Group (a group of developed countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Iceland) stressed private sector involvement and creating an enabling environment. During contact group meetings and informal discussions, delegates deliberated on draft text prepared by the Co-Chairs.",
      "Discussions were generally divided along north-south lines, with Parties focused on a broad range of issues, including: whether SBSTA should 'request' or 'recommend' tasks to EGTT under its terms of reference; the review of COP decisions since COP 1; the assessment of the implementation framework; the involvement of the private sector; long term strategies; and the consideration of specific technologies. On the review of COP decisions, the G-77/China supported reviewing all COP decisions, while the EU, the US, Japan, and others said that the framework for implementation was the starting point, since it already considered previous decisions. On involvement of the private sector, discussion focused on who should facilitate private sector involvement and provide enabling environments. Discussion also focused on whether there should be a long-term strategy for technology transfer or a long-term strategy specifically for the EGTT\u0092s programme of work. Regarding consideration of specific technologies, the G-77/China wanted a listing of specific technologies to be considered by the EGTT, while the US, EU, Japan and others said that SBSTA should not 'pick winners.",
      "' Compromise text was agreed for all issues."
