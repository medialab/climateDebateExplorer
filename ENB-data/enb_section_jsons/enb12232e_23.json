      "On financial and technical support, participants recommend that: the GEF should be asked to clarify to non-Annex I Parties that two options - expedited procedures or full-size GEF proposals - are available to fund the preparation of national communications, and that Parties have the freedom to choose the option that suits them best; a decision on what option Parties will select for funding their national communications should be taken after the stocktaking exercise is completed; and, the NCSP should develop and, where necessary, strengthen its partnerships with regional climate centers and centers of excellence in delivering technical support to non-Annex I Parties."
