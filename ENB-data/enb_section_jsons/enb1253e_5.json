      "The non-group on institutions and mechanisms continued discussions on proposals for Final Elements.",
      "Virtually every item discussed remained in brackets at the end of the meeting, with some delegates privately conceding that certain proposals are being placed 'on ice' until some of the encompassing issues at the AGBM have been cleared.",
      "On the relationship to other agreements, a number of Parties opposed a proposal on derogation on the grounds that it would subordinate the Protocol to other pre-existing institutions, particularly the World Trade Organization (WTO).",
      "Another group of countries wanted to establish that nothing in the Protocol would prejudice the rights and obligations of WTO members.",
      "In a paragraph on a Party\u0092s rights under international law, a number of Parties argued that the proposal was simply a statement of the current legal state of affairs, but others said the reference should be retained. Some Parties also argued that a paragraph on provisional application of the instrument was redundant.",
      "Others suggested that the provision could prove useful in helping to overcome domestic legal obstacles.",
      "The fate of a paragraph on ratification was linked to the outcome of discussions on a proposal laying down restrictions under the Protocol for regional economic organizations. On entry into force, two main positions emerged.",
      "Some supported ratification based on the number of signatories.",
      "Others supported a 'weighted entry into force' linking ratification to the percentage contributions to GHG emissions of ratifying countries.",
      "A number of Parties supported a proposal that would ensure that a Party\u0092s withdrawal from the Protocol would not operate to limit its liability for any claim accruing against it as a result of economic injury sustained by developing countries."
