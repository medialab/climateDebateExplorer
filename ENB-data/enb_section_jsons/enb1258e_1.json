      "SBI Vice-Chair Jos\u00e9 Romero (Switzerland) invited Parties to continue discussion on the pilot phase of activities implemented jointly (AIJ) and recalled that a joint SBSTA/SBI contact group would begin work on this item.",
      "SRI LANKA noted the obstacles posed by the additionality principle in the AIJ criteria and welcomed a decision by France to delete the additionality condition from its AIJ guidelines.",
      "He called on other Annex I Parties to do likewise.",
      "INDIA, supported by VENEZUELA, highlighted the limited scope and geographical distribution of current projects and the narrow information base available for assessment.",
      "He said a comprehensive review of the pilot phase would not be possible as envisaged by the COP.",
      "He called for more projects utilizing frontline technologies and clear data on GHG reductions, cost effectiveness and contribution to capacity building.",
      "AUSTRALIA said Parties must capture the advantages in cost effectiveness and environmental gains.",
      "He noted the importance of flexibility in financing AIJ and announced an Australian AIJ initiative with three developing countries. On national communications from Parties included in Annex I, the Secretariat introduced the first compilation and synthesis (FCCC/SBI/1997/19), an addendum containing tables of inventories of anthropogenic emissions and removals (Add.1); and updated information on GHG emissions and projections (INF.4).",
      "The US supported the development of an electronic reporting program, and requested a report based on Parties\u0092 suggestions for improvements.",
      "He noted that many Parties did not follow the guidelines for reporting for policies and measures.",
      "The EU noted that: some Parties have had difficulty complying with guidelines; non-Annex I experts should participate in the review process; and its communication *is being finalized.",
      "The US and the EU noted the inadequacy of reporting measures for HFCs, SFCs and SF6. CHINA stated that reporting should focus on CO2, policies and measures should take into account different country situations, and that the report does not adequately address technology transfer.",
      "NEW ZEALAND said Parties should nominate a range of experts for reviewing reports.",
      "With the EU, she did not support the Secretariat's proposal to discontinue the distribution of executive summaries drawn from the communications.",
      "UZBEKISTAN said the participation of national experts from countries with economies in transition and developing countries could provide good training.",
      "URUGUAY said it had just presented its first national communication and called for broad FCCC implementation by Parties that bear the greatest responsibilities. On the review of the financial mechanism, the Vice-Chair informed delegations that a proposed Chair's draft decision had been prepared and appeared as Appendix III to document FCCC/SBI/1997/16.",
      "The GEF introduced its report to COP-3, which addressed how it had implemented the guidance provided by previous COPs.",
      "She noted that during the 13 month reporting period, total project funding for climate change activities exceeded US$570 million, of which the GEF provided approximately US$155 million in grant financing.",
      "She said the report described activities undertaken by GEF to improve its performance, including a report on the application of the concept of full incremental costs. The EU said that the review of the financial mechanism should be seen as an ongoing activity of the COP, that EU members had already pressed for replenishment of GEF and that it hoped that this meeting would agree to the designation of GEF as the financial mechanism.",
      "TANZANIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, reiterated its position on the need to continue dialogue on the designation of GEF as the FCCC financial mechanism.",
      "INDIA pointed to the need to expand the parameters that are used on the ground by GEF for the preparation of initial communications.",
      "A drafting group was established to consider the issue further. Delegates also considered proposed amendments.",
      "The Vice- Chair said the question is whether SBI should make recommendations to the COP regarding the amendments.",
      "One submitted by Pakistan and Azerbaijan would remove Turkey from Annexes I and II.",
      "Pakistan noted Turkey's status as a medium developed country and its fractional emissions compared to the Annex I average.",
      "TURKEY said it intends to become a Party, but its burden would be disproportionate given its economic circumstances. The EU said all OECD members should adopt commitments under a protocol.",
      "He opposed the amendment, pending a possible special regime for Turkey, Mexico and Korea or Turkey's indication of a target it would assume.",
      "KOREA distinguished between the status it shares with Mexico as a non-Annex I Party and that of Turkey.",
      "He said it was another matter whether Korea would voluntarily assume emissions reductions.",
      "MEXICO said there was no grounds to include Mexico and Korea in possible protocol annexes.",
      "He rejected attempts to link membership in any organization with Convention obligations. JAPAN and CANADA said all cases including Turkey's should fall within an overall review of Annexes required by December 1998.",
      "The US said a recommendation would be easier to develop when the post-2000 regime and various national roles are clear. An amendment proposed by the EU would permit adoption of a protocol by 3/4 majority if consensus is absent, and would apply the protocol provisionally pending its entry into force.",
      "The EU said the amendment allows the majority's desire for urgent action to be met.",
      "He recommended leaving the amendment on the table for COP-3. SAUDI ARABIA said the amendment opened the door for many more and that provisional application violated the Convention.",
      "VENEZUELA said provisional application was 'absurd' and not a proper amendment.",
      "The US and CHINA expressed reservations about provisional application.",
      "AUSTRALIA said he cannot accept a protocol with economic implications adopted by majority voting.",
      "KOREA opposed the amendment. An amendment proposed by KUWAIT calls on Annex I Parties to provide financial resources, including technology transfer, determined by the COP to meet the full incremental costs of developing countries' obligations.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA said the amendment is the only way to ensure necessary funds are forthcoming.",
      "The UK, the US, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and SWITZERLAND did not accept the amendment.",
      "The Vice-Chair suggested a conclusion noting that proposed amendments be forwarded to COP-3, recommending that the COP take account of views expressed during SBI."
