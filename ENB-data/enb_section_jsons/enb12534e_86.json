      "This issue was addressed in an informal group, facilitated by Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe).",
      "Parties shared their views on whether the text should stress a peak emissions year and a global goal or if it should be more holistic.",
      "A group of countries tabled a new proposal for a draft decision on shared vision, calling on SBSTA, inter alia , to initiate a process to articulate the meaning, implications and operationalization of equitable access to sustainable development in the climate change regime, and to initiate a process to study the implications of the elaboration of a long-term global goal for emissions reductions by 2050 and a timeframe for global peaking.",
      "Parties discussed four possible options for consideration by Ministers: a first option to agree on the numbers identifying the global goal for emission reductions and the timeframe for global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions and then discussing other issues; a second option to first consider the context for the adoption of the numbers; a third option to propose a process to make a decision on the issue and possible steps forward; or a fourth option to drop the issue owing to lack of agreement.",
      "Many parties supported presenting the four options to the Ministers and indicated their preferences.",
      "While many developing country parties supported the third option to set up a process, some developed countries supported the two first options to discuss the numbers.",
      "A group of developing countries cautioned against the third option, urging for the establishment of numbers to ensure peaking by 2015.",
      "Facilitator Mukahanana-Sangarwe continued bilateral consultations and encouraged parties to consult informally.",
      "The issue was finally considered at the ministerial level and a decision was adopted by the COP plenary on 11 December as part of the AWG-LCA outcome.",
      "Outstanding text on shared vision was incorporated in the note by the Chair on work undertaken in the informal groups in the preparation of a comprehensive and balanced outcome to be presented to the Conference of the Parties for adoption at its seventeenth session (FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/CRP.39, hereinafter CRP.39) for further consideration, including different options on preambular text and different options on the global goal for substantially reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.",
      "Other options for further consideration included in CRP.39 include: timeframe for global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions, equity, historical responsibility, establishment of global goals for finance, establishment of global goals for technology, establishment of global goals for adaptation, establishment of global goals for capacity building, trade, response measures, intellectual property issues in relation to technology, low-carbon and climate-resilient society, human rights, rights of mother earth, right to survive, an international climate court of justice, and warfare."
