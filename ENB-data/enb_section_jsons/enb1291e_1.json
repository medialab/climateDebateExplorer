   "sentences": [
      "The SBI and SBSTA discussed preparations for the first session of the Conference of Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol (COP/MOP-1).",
      "The Chairs introduced their draft decision (FCCC/CP/1998/3) and invited comment.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA said preparations were needed for all Protocol articles, not just the flexibility mechanisms.",
      "He stressed that Protocol Articles 3.14 and 2.3 (minimization of adverse effects on developing countries) had not been adequately addressed.",
      "He suggested convening a separate contact group, discussing the issues in the contact group on FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 or in the one on flexibility mechanisms.",
      "VENEZUELA, BANGLADESH, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, IRAN, SYRIA, KUWAIT, LEBANON, NIGERIA, GAMBIA, ECUADOR, ALGERIA, MOROCCO and INDONESIA supported SAUDI ARABIA. SWITZERLAND supported the draft decision but suggested possible amendments to the timeframe and scope of work.",
      "The US proposed amending the decision to reflect the differing legal status of the Convention and the Protocol.",
      "The EU, supported by MONACO, noted the need to specify ways to facilitate cooperation and stressed coordination of IPCC and FCCC activities through a joint working group.",
      "He proposed establishing a compliance mechanism and scheduling a meeting for early 1999.",
      "JAPAN noted the need for time for consultation and difficulties in combining ongoing work under the FCCC and the Protocol.",
      "He opposed deadlines for setting compliance procedures until the mechanisms were elaborated.",
      "CANADA called for a balance between the Convention and the Protocol and said Protocol issues need attention so that Parties will ratify it. The Chair said Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 were within the scope of the contact group\u0092s work and the group would determine its own agenda.",
      "KUWAIT, NIGERIA and SAUDI ARABIA sought a clear mandate for the contact group to consider Articles 2.3 and 3.14.",
      "The US, JAPAN and AUSTRALIA said decision 3/CP.3, which specified the mandate of the contact group, did not require specific consideration of Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14.",
      "The EU said the issue merited discussion but it was unnecessary to highlight specific articles. The Chair said no separate contact groups would be established.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA called for a work plan and timeline on Article 3.14 for COP/MOP 1, and said that progress on Article 3.14 should follow an approach similar to Protocol Articles 6, 12 and 17 (flexibility mechanisms).",
      "The Chair indicated that no work plan or timetable for any of the articles in question would be developed, but these items will be explored because they are linked.",
      "Espen R\u00f8nneberg (Marshall Islands) will consult on preparatory issues to COP/MOP-1. The discussion on research and systematic observation was continued from the previous day (FCCC/CP/1998/7 and FCCC/CP/1998/MISC.2).",
      "Parties indicated the value of the GCOS Report and the significance of its work.",
      "As a result, Parties called for expansion of research and systematic observation, many highlighting the need to focus research and systematic observation systems on developing countries and issues that were relevant to them to combat the deterioration of these systems.",
      "MAURITIUS, TANZANIA and SAUDI ARABIA called on the subsidiary bodies to instruct the GEF to provide funding for research and systematic observations in developing countries. Chair Chow explained that the methodological issues relating to Annex I national communications will be discussed at an expert workshop to be held in December by the Secretariat (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/7, FCCC/SBSTA/1998/8 FCCC/SBSTA/1998/Misc.6 and ADD.1).",
      "The Secretariat provided a background to these issues, explained work conducted and previous meetings held, and described the plan for development of appropriate guidelines.",
      "The conclusions of the workshop will be discussed in SBSTA-10.",
      "John Christensen (UNEP) provided a background to an international collaborative report on methodological issues.",
      "The US called for the resolution of issues and expected to use them to develop guidelines and national measurement systems that could be ratified by COP-6.",
      "The US proposed that the December workshop consider methodological, reporting, review and assessment issues.",
      "NORWAY sought continual re-evaluation of inventory data including base years as methodologies improve.",
      "Chairman Chow proposed that he prepare a draft decision for consideration by SBSTA. With SWITZERLAND, the EU recognized that there is a link between the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols.",
      "He requested the subsidiary bodies to provide a list of available technologies to limit and reduce emissions of HFCs and PFCs.",
      "The US, with AUSTRALIA, said there should be coordination between international environmental agreements, but the process required careful consideration given the possible implication on industry.",
      "He proposed that SBSTA consider the impact of the phase out of substances covered under the Montreal Protocol and asked that they consult with that body.",
      "Chairman Chow proposed that he hold consultations on this matter."
