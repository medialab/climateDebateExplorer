      "The AWG-LCA Chair also held informal consultations on organization of further work.",
      "Reporting on the outcomes to the AWG-LCA closing plenary on Friday, 12 June, he explained that the AWG-LCA would move into a third phase in August, characterized by work in five informal groups.",
      "He clarified that only two groups, open to all parties and observers, would meet at any one time and said efforts would be taken to ensure related matters are not addressed at the same time.",
      "He noted plans to conduct further informal consultations on the legal form of the outcome and on other issues, as identified, and explained that interpretation would be provided during the informal plenary sessions and, to the extent possible, at the meetings of informal groups.",
      "He then noted a proposal by some parties for an informal session prior to the August meeting to explain their proposals.",
      "Some parties expressed concern that such a session would conflict with group coordination prior to the meeting and noted that such an event should not prejudice the final outcome.",
      "India opposed such an event as it falls outside of the AWG-LCA s mandate.",
      "The US supported the opportunity for parties to better understand each other s positions."
