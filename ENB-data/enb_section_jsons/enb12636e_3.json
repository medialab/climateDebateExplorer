      "Co-facilitator Franz Perrez invited comments on the co-facilitators\u2019 table, which aimed to structure the section into themes and ideas, and to identify text and linkages to other sections. Many parties expressed willingness to work on the basis of the table.",
      "CHINA suggested alternative clustering options.",
      "SOUTH AFRICA emphasized that reorganization should retain everything agreed so far.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA called for a party-driven clustering process. INDIA and ARGENTINA reiterated the LMDCs proposal on clustering.",
      "Many parties supported the proposal by Kenya, for the AFRICAN GROUP, to structure the mitigation section around: long-term global goal on mitigation; individual commitments; characteristics; arrangements/mechanisms; and mandate/authority for the governing body. BOLIVIA called for including the 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C limit, and opposed addressing markets and land use.",
      "BRAZIL cautioned against reopening negotiations on REDD+, which he viewed as linked to the finance section.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA called for including the issue of equity. Many parties suggested using the African Group\u2019s proposal as a starting point.",
      "Others called for all proposals to inform future work. After prolonged discussions on the way forward, Perrez suggested, and parties agreed, that the co-facilitators work on the basis of all inputs and prepare a \u201cneutral storyline\u201d that does not pre-empt any negotiating position, and \u201clump\u201d text under different headings. NORWAY proposed, and parties agreed, that paragraphs in the text be included under only one heading, and not be repeated several times."
