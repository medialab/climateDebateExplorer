      "The contact group met to consider the Co-Chairs' draft text on a framework for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation of FCCC Article 4.5 (development and transfer of technology). On Purposes, the G-77/CHINA proposed specifying that the text shall serve as a framework for implementation of FCCC Article 4.5 commitments, and stressed that the extent to which developing countries can implement their commitments under the FCCC depended on effective participation by developed countries.",
      "SWITZERLAND said it should enhance implementation of Article 4.5 by increasing the flow of environmentally-sound technologies. On the Overall Approach, the G-77/CHINA proposed Agenda 21 language on technology transfer, while the US preferred language from FCCC Article 4.5.",
      "SWITZERLAND objected to a US proposal to delete the term 'equitable' in describing the process of technology transfer, given the diversity of characteristics of developing countries and regions.",
      "On market-driven approaches, EL SALVADOR stressed the need to reflect the involvement of governments."
