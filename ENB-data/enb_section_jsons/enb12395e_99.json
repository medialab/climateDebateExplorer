      "These issues were first taken up by the AWG-KP plenary on 1 December.",
      "On 3 December, parties held an in-session workshop on mitigation potentials (for more details on this workshop, see: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12388e.html).",
      "Based on AWG-KP Chair Dovland s scenario note (FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/7), which proposed a strategic discussion on the elements of the AWG-KP s work programme, parties agreed to consider jointly the agenda items on: means to reach emission reduction targets; methodological issues; analysis of mitigation potentials and identification of ranges of emission reduction objectives of Annex I parties; and further commitments by Annex I parties.",
      "These issues were then considered in a contact group and informal and Friends of the Chair consultations chaired by AWG-KP Chair Dovland.",
      "The AWG-KP plenary adopted conclusions (FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/L.18) on 10 December 2008.",
      "Early discussions focused on elaborating the relationship between climate science, a possible aggregate range of emission reductions for Annex I parties, and individual targets.",
      "Developing countries highlighted the IPCC AR4 and called for a mid-term aggregate emission reduction range for Annex I parties of 25-40% by 2020.",
      "They sought agreement on this point before moving to individual country commitments, in the form of quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives (QELROs).",
      "Some developed countries, however, rejected setting an overall range as a basis for individual commitments, emphasizing their national circumstances, and preferred instead to pledge their individual emission reduction targets.",
      "In the final compromise, both the scale of Annex I emission reductions in aggregate and individual party commitments are addressed, but the relationship between the two is not clearly laid out.",
      "On the aggregate range, the outcome contains language similar to the AWG-KP s previous conclusions noting that further consideration of this issue should be informed by recent scientific information, including the AR4, and referring to the 25-40% range.",
      "On the nature of commitments, parties agreed after extended discussions that these should principally take the form of QELROs.",
      "However, instead of describing how these QELROs might be derived from the overall range, as initially sought by developing countries, parties note existing pledges for emission reduction targets, and invite submission of information on possible QELROs."
