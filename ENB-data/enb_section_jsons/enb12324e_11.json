      "On the proposed budget for 2008-2009, the Secretariat elaborated on issues relating to income generated by the share of proceeds from CDM projects, noting that CDM activities under the Kyoto Protocol were moved from the core budget to fee-based income.",
      "He also clarified that increases in the UN scale of indicative contributions might affect individual party contributions. SOUTH AFRICA observed that under certain conditions, it appeared that a large amount of the CDM fee-based income would actually be generated from developing countries, and asked whether developing countries would in effect be funding a significant amount of the expanded Secretariat budget.",
      "Chair Dovland proposed that parties consider the budget proposal overnight.",
      "He signaled that it might be prudent to support the Executive Secretary's first budget to enable him to strengthen capacities in key areas and implement outlined activities."
