      "The Chair of the contact group on non-Annex I communications, Mohamed Ould el Ghaouth (Mauritania), introduced amendments to the decision on non-Annex I communications (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP.10/Add.1) including, inter alia: a request to the consultative group of experts to consider, 'as appropriate' the needs for and the availability of financial resources and technical support; and a request to the Secretariat to make information on non-Annex I communication experts available on the FCCC Internet site.",
      "The decision was adopted as amended. Decisions on income and budget performance in the biennium 1998 - 1999 (FCCC/SBI/1999/L.9) and on the programme budget for the biennium 2000 - 2001 (FCCC/SBI/1999/L.8) were adopted, on the understanding that the scale of contributions set therein would not set a precedent.",
      "Delegates then adopted the draft report of SBI-11 (FCCC/SBI/ 1999/L.11)."
