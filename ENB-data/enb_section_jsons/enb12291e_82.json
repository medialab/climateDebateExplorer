      "The international transaction log, a system that performs automated checks to verify transactions of different carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol, was first addressed by SBSTA on 29 November.",

      "The contact group met three times and informal consultations were also convened.",
      "While no serious disagreements arose, there were questions about the timeline for implementing the international transaction log.",
      "China and some others wanted to ensure that the international transaction log, which is supposed to allow national registry systems to connect to it by April 2007, functions properly and meets the specifications set for it.",
      "Text was added to this effect.",
      "On 6 December, SBSTA agreed to a draft decision, which was subsequently adopted by the COP/MOP 1 on 9 December."
