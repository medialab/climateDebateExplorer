      "On Thursday morning, informal discussions on non-reporting issues related to harvested wood products (HWP) took place.",
      "There was general agreement among participants that the scope of the discussion was separate from the reporting of HWP and therefore any discussion should be included within the broader issue of LULUCF.",
      "A draft text was proposed by the Co-Chairs, building on decision text from SB 24, and adding that HWP issues would be considered in a broader context.",
      "In the afternoon the contact group reconvened, with delegates considering draft conclusions related to the 2006 Guidelines. BRAZIL, supported by CHINA, proposed deleting reference to the evolution process of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines, and the US, supported by a number of other parties, suggested a footnote to the overview chapter on IPCC guidelines.",
      "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION questioned proposals from the EU and others to change the order of the paragraphs.",
      "The US queried language indicating that the UNFCCC reporting guidelines need to be revised before a decision is made on how to use the 2006 Guidelines.",
      "The EU proposed wording on voluntary use of the 2006 Guidelines ensuring consistency with the UNFCCC reporting guidelines, while BRAZIL suggested that the two guidelines should be applied in parallel in certain sectors.",
      "He emphasized that even though this means extra work, experience on the 2006 Guidelines is necessary before deciding on their use. GHANA then proposed adjourning the meeting to allow the G-77/China time to coordinate, but the Co-Chairs suggested hearing comments on the other paragraphs first.",
      "On the remaining text, BRAZIL proposed language on managed lands, the EU suggested inviting the IPCC and other relevant organization to continue their efforts, and the US sought to bracket a paragraph on capacity building for the use of the 2006 Guidelines.",
      "Revised text will be prepared and informal consultations are set to continue on Friday afternoon."
