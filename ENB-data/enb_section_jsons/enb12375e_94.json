      "In themselves, the Bonn meetings are not likely to feature prominently in the annals of history, or even those of the climate change negotiations.",
      "There was no real pressure, as no outcomes were mandated in Bonn, although some realized that a quarter of the time to complete the Bali roadmap has already slipped away.",
      "However, Bonn may be remembered as the meeting where the majority of participants realized the full scale of the substantive, procedural, and logistical challenges before them.",
      "If some seemed dispirited by the workload ahead, few delegates would dispute the need to face these challenges.",
      "The SBSTA workshop on the IPCC during the first week of the Bonn talks served as a timely reminder about just how important it is to seek a post-2012 agreement, however complex the process has become.",
