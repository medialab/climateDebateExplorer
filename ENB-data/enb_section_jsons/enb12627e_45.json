      "While the decisions arrived at in Nairobi do not stray far from the status quo, there was consolation in the fact that the IPCC did request further consideration of many of these issues by the Bureau and Panel itself.",
      "The IPCC s openness to consider some of these issues in the future, not precluding what could come up and how it will respond, reflects a trust in its own policies and procedures, largely as a result of the changes enacted following the IAC review.",
      "In fact, the most important changes and decisions on the sixth assessment cycle are still to come, and when they do, it may not be so easy to keep things flexible and open, as concrete choices will have to be made as meat is put on the bones during the AR6 scoping meetings.",
      "Moreover, a new Chair and a whole new Bureau will be elected at the next meeting; and a new IPCC Secretary is due to be appointed when Secretary Renate Christ retires in May.",
      "There is also work for governments to do at home, supporting the efforts of scientists and their institutions and helping them engage with the IPCC.",
      "Only in this way will there be greater involvement and knowledge from and about developing countries.",
      "Once the new Bureau is in place and the IPCC begins the AR6 process in earnest, the lessons learned from the AR5 cycle with regard to the types of products that are the most useful to policymakers, and the necessity of engaging more scientists from developing countries, should begin to be applied.",
      "As the IPCC has proven, and as Acting Chair Ismail El Gizouli said in the closing press conference, the IPCC is a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
