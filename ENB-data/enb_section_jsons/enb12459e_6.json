      "The outcome was a series of non-papers, forwarded to Copenhagen as an annex to the meeting report ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/14 ).",
      "While progress on issues such as adaptation, technology and capacity building was commonly described as satisfactory, many felt that deep divides persisted on mitigation and certain aspects of finance.",
      "During AWG-KP 9, discussions continued on all issues in the AWG-KP s work programme.",
      "Most felt, however, that no significant progress was made on Annex I parties aggregate and individual targets, and differences also surfaced between developed and developing countries concerning whether the outcome from Copenhagen should be an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol or a single new agreement under both AWGs.",
      "AWG-KP 9 did not conclude consideration of any of the issues in its work programme."
