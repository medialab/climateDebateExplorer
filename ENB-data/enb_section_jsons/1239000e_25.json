      "The IPCC sought the SBSTA\u0092s views on assumptions concerning economic, social and other goals of Parties between 2000 and 2010 and beyond that were likely to affect GHG emissions from energy and other sectors. CANADA and the US called for realistic scenarios.",
      "The EU suggested using extended and illustrative profiles to represent the proposals, which range from a 0.5 percent reduction per annum after 2000 to a 20 percent reduction by 2005 followed by a two percent reduction per annum thereafter.",
      "CHINA called for a focus on the cumulative concentration of GHG emissions.",
