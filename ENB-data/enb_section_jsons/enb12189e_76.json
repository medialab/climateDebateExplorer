      "Not far from the Palais des Congr\u00e8s de Marrakech, site of the COP- 7 climate negotiations, is Jemaa el-Fna, the centuries old market square that forms the heart of Marrakesh.",
      "This is the place where traders and artists, storytellers and acrobats, carpet-sellers and snake charmers come together to entertain, and - amidst great wringing of hands and shaking of heads - to close a good deal.",
      "For the last two weeks the spirited performers and wily traders that dominate this historic square have been competing for attention with the seasoned negotiators of the climate change caravan.",
      "Although not quite as accessible - or as entertaining - to the general public, the antics of the climate negotiators have nevertheless provided a good lesson to those seeking to understand the art of driving a hard bargain."
