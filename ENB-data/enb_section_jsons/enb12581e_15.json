      "This section states that the report builds on the AR4 and incorporates subsequent new findings.",
      "It also explains in detail the two approaches taken to communicate uncertainties: one based on confidence level and one on likelihood.",
      "In the former, a qualitative level of confidence (from 'very low'to 'very high') in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models and expert judgment) and the degree of agreement.",
      "In the latter, a probabilistic assessment is based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgment, and described in levels of quantified likelihood (from 'exceptionally unlikely'to 'virtually certain')."
