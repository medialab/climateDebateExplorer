      "COP-4 met in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November 1998, to set out a schedule for reaching agreement on the operational details of the Protocol and for strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC itself.",
      "This work schedule was outlined in a decision known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA).",
      "The critical deadline under the BAPA was COP-6, where Parties were to reach agreement on a package of issues.",
      "Critical Protocol-related issues needing resolution included rules relating to the mechanisms, a regime for assessing Parties' compliance, and accounting methods for national emissions and emissions reductions.",
      "Rules on crediting countries for carbon sinks were also to be addressed.",
      "Issues under the UNFCCC requiring resolution included questions of capacity building, the development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those developing countries that are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized countries to combat climate change. Numerous formal and informal meetings and consultations were held during 1999 and 2000 to help lay the foundations for an agreement at COP-6.",
      "However, as COP-6 drew near, political positions on the key issues remained entrenched, with little indication of willingness to compromise or move forward."
