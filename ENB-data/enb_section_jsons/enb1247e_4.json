      "Delegates at an informal budget discussion differed Monday afternoon on the implications of budgetary decisions for AGBM and COP-3 deliberations.",
      "Some supported including funds for a possible post-Kyoto process within a proposed contingency budget or even including those funds in the FCCC\u0092s core budget, while others said the budget should not prejudge whether coming negotiations will establish such a process.",
      "The need for separately listing funds for Annex 1 and non-Annex 1 Parties\u0092 implementation was also questioned, but a number of delegations said the distinction in Parties\u0092 responsibilities should not be eliminated in the budget.",
      "Several delegations also expressed concerns about the apparent increase in staff and overall budget amount compared to 1997 figures and requested further information on these issues from the Secretariat."
