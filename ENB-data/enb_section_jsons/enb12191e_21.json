      "Yamil Bonduki, Technical Advisor, National Communications Support Programme, UNDP-GEF, presented a summary on a recent UNDP/NCSP survey.",
      "He noted that technology transfer issues are only briefly referred to in countries\u0092 national communications.",
      "His survey indicated that 55 countries had been provided with additional 'top-up' support for their technology needs assessments, and that an additional 30-40 countries may submit 'top-up' proposals.",
      "He observed that the focus is generally on mitigation technologies and that an assessment of technology needs for adaptation is a priority that needs to be addressed.",
      "He concluded that lack of practical guidance is the most important constraint for assessing technology needs."
