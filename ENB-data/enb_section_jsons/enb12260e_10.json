      "SBSTA requests the Secretariat to organize an in-session workshop at SBSTA-22, focusing on: factors that affect mitigation technology innovation, deployment and diffusion, including international cooperative efforts and removal of barriers; and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation, such as costs and benefits, co-benefits, poverty reduction, and economic impacts, including spillover effects. SBSTA invites Parties to submit their views on the organization of the in-session workshop, on lessons learned from previous mitigation workshops, and any future steps under this agenda item, and requests the Secretariat to compile these submissions to facilitate the ongoing consideration of these topics at SBSTA-23."
