      "Chair Watkinson presented the contact group with SBI draft conclusions containing a proposed COP/MOP 2 decision on issues such as Secretariat assistance to individuals who are the subject of disputes, minimizing the risks of such disputes, and financial implications.",
      "In the section on assistance, CANADA replaced references to disputes, complaints or claims with concerns or issues and also proposed removing a specific reference to the Secretariat providing legal counsel. BRAZIL suggested establishing an ad hoc special review team to analyze complaints or claims.",
      "However, CANADA said this would require considerable discussion, and the proposal was not included in the text. ARGENTINA noted different perceptions on whether the risk to individuals serving on Protocol bodies is a significant issue.",
      "She suggested that Canada's proposals had weakened the current text and urged further consideration of this matter.",
      "Parties agreed to a proposal from Brazil for a new paragraph inviting parties to submit their views on the issue by 23 February 2007.",
      "The agreed text will be forwarded to SBI."
