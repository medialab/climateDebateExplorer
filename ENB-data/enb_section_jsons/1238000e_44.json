      "As one observer noted, SBSTA-2, for the most part, proved but a dress rehearsal for SBSTA-3, with delegates delivering many of the same arguments in a more dramatic fashion.",
      "Agreement on the treatment of the SAR, perhaps the most difficult issue of COP-2, eluded the SBSTA once again.",
      "Many delegations endorsed the SAR as the most comprehensive assessment on climate change available, while others, including many oil producing States and Australia, thought it would be premature to make recommendations.",
      "A 'Friends of the Chair' group was ultimately formed to reach a consensus, but the group was unable to resolve anything.",
      "This issue demonstrates that the boundaries between science and politics are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain."
