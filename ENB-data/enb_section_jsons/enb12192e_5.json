      "A number of meetings and consultations were convened after COP-6 Part I in an effort to get negotiations back on track.",
      "In late June 2001, President Pronk presented a consolidated negotiating text to help negotiators reach a compromise.",
      "However, while some participants expressed the opinion that positions did not appear to have shifted since COP-6 Part I, others suggested that positions had possibly widened on issues such as LULUCF, sinks in the CDM, and funding. In addition to official preparations for COP-6 Part II, there were a number of political developments following the meeting in The Hague.",
      "In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the Protocol, stating that it considered the Protocol to be 'fatally flawed,' as it would damage its economy and it exempts developing countries from emissions targets."
