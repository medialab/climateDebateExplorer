      "In the morning, delegates discussed the functions of the constituted body on technology transfer, clarifying their positions on whether to have the body report directly to the COP or to the Subsidiary Bodies.",
      "The Secretariat warned that limiting discussion to the COP could actually reduce the time available for technology transfer negotiations.",
      "The timeline for the development of performance indicators was also discussed.",
      "In the afternoon, alternative text was proposed by a group of developed countries regarding indicators and two more proposals were made for the development of short, medium and long term strategies.",
      "An impasse on text relating to the body's functions resulted in some parties suggesting moving on to discuss text on membership and organization of work.",
      "However, developing countries objected to discussing these elements until the functions of the body were agreed.",
      "After a recess, parties suggested changes to the new text and these were positively received.",
      "Revised decision text and a draft SBSTA conclusion will be available Saturday afternoon with negotiations to continue on Monday."
