      "On Wednesday, 13 November, Chair Muyungi reported that his informal consultations on whether or not to convene a contact group yielded agreement to consider at SBSTA 40 the Secretariat's report on the workshop, as well as submissions by parties and observer organizations, and not to convene a contact group.",

      "They called for SBSTA 40 to build on areas of commonality.",
      "Other developed countries also expressed regret that no contact group was established and the submissions were not considered at SBSTA 39.",
      "Many developing countries supported the way the conclusions were adopted, noting the procedures were correctly applied, and emphasized the role of agriculture in adaptation.",
      "Final Outcome: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.35) the SBSTA acknowledges parties exchange of views during the in-session workshop and agrees to consider at SBSTA 40 the report of the in-session workshop and the views submitted by parties and observer organizations."
