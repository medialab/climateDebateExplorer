      "The Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development (IACSD), in September 1998, decided to establish an Ad Hoc Inter-Agency Task Force on Energy with a view to ensuring a collaborative contribution of UN organizations to the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) process on energy and sustainable development.",
      "The first meeting of the Task Force took place on 8 April 1999 in New York.",
      "The Task Force agreed that activities to be undertaken should be complementary and mutually supportive and that duplication of work, such as that undertaken by the FCCC, should be avoided.",
      "Task Force members reviewed activities currently underway and/or planned by them in preparation for the ninth session of the CSD (CSD-9).",
      "To enhance coordination and promote synergies among these activities, they decided to establish an electronic network and agreed to provide updated information on ongoing and envisioned work so that a matrix of UN activities geared towards CSD-9 could be established.",
      "The Task Force will meet again in September/October 1999 to follow-up on preparations for CSD-9.",
