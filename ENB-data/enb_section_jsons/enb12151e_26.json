      "Additional guidance to the GEF: On Tuesday, 12 September, SBI briefly took up the matter of additional guidance to the GEF.",
      "The issue was considered further during informal consultations held from 12-15 September.",
      "These consultations focused on a proposed draft decision submitted by the G-77/China containing additional guidance to the GEF in its role as the operating entity of the financial mechanism.",
      "The proposal aims at integrating decisions that refer to the GEF's activities.",
      "In further consultations, Parties responded to and discussed the text.",
      "The US, with Canada and the EU said the proposal addressed issues currently under consideration in other negotiating groups, such as discussions on Stage III adaptation, and cautioned against moving beyond other related negotiations.",
      "The G-77/China said ongoing discussions in other groups should not prevent guidance being given to the financial mechanism. In the SBI Plenary on Friday, 15 September, Chair Ashe announced that consideration of this matter would continue during the second part of SB-13, and that a contact group would be convened, chaired by Kerry Groves (Australia) and SBI Chair Ashe.",

      "' The draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2000/CRP.9/Add.1), which will be the subject of contact group discussions, remains bracketed almost in its entirety.",
      "It provides additional advice to the GEF in the light of the launch of negotiations on the GEF's third replenishment.",
      "The text, inter alia, decides that the GEF should provide financial resources to developing country Parties, in particular the least developed and small island developing States in a range of activities relating to capacity building."
