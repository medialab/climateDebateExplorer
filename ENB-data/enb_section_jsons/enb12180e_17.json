      "Delegates 'got down to business' Tuesday as negotiating groups took up outstanding work left over from Bonn on compliance, the mechanisms and Articles 5, 7 and 8.",
      "Participants seemed pleased that some groups were already addressing substantive issues in a productive way, even if some noted that it was too early to expect significant movement, or to gauge overall progress, especially as much of the detailed technical work will be taking place in informal consultations. In other news, a few delegates in informal drafting groups on JI and the CDM expressed concern at what they saw as moves to apply 'double standards' to JI and CDM that could reopen 'old divisions' on project review processes and environmental assessments.",
      "Others dismissed such suggestions, noting that it was appropriate for some differences to exist."
