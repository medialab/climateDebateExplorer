   "sentences": [
      "The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess, on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis, the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts, and options for adaptation and mitigation.",
      "The IPCC does not undertake new research, nor does it monitor climate-related data.",
      "Instead, it conducts assessments of knowledge on the basis of published and peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature.",
      "IPCC reports are intended to be neutral with respect to policy, but not prescriptive.",
      "The IPCC has three Working Groups (WGs): Working Group I (WGI) addresses the physical science basis of the climate system and climate change; Working Group II (WGII) addresses the vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change, impacts of climate change and adaptation options; and Working Group III (WGIII) addresses options for limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigating climate change.",
      "Until IPCC-41, each WG has had two Co-Chairs and six Vice-Chairs, except WGIII, which, for the fifth assessment cycle, had three Co-Chairs.",
      "The Co-Chairs guide the WGs in fulfilling the mandates given to them by the Panel and are assisted in this task by Technical Support Units (TSUs).",
      "The IPCC also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI) to oversee the IPCC National GHG Inventories Programme, which aims to: develop and refine an internationally-agreed methodology and software for the calculation and reporting of national GHG emissions and removals; and encourage the use of this methodology by parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",
      "The Panel elects its Bureau for the duration of a full assessment cycle, and the preparation of an IPCC assessment report.",
      "The Bureau s role is to assist the IPCC Chair in planning, coordinating and monitoring the IPCC s work, and is composed of climate change experts representing all regions.",
      "Currently, the Bureau comprises 31 members: the IPCC Chair and Vice-Chairs, the WG Co-Chairs and Vice-Chairs, and the TFI Co-Chairs.",
      "In 2011, the IPCC established an Executive Committee (ExComm) to assist with intersessional work and coordination among the WGs.",
      "The ExComm consists of the IPCC Chair, IPCC Vice-Chairs, WGs and TFI Co-Chairs, and advisory members, including the Head of the Secretariat and the four Heads of the TSUs.",
      "The IPCC Secretariat is located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is hosted by the WMO."
