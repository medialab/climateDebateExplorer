      "The co-facilitators of the Dialogue, Howard Bamsey (Australia) and Sandea de Wet (South Africa) outlined the planned organization of the meeting, noting that it was not a negotiation, but rather an open and non-binding discussion held 'without prejudice to any future negotiations, commitments, process, framework or mandate under the Convention.",
      "' Noting that delegates would bring a range of different views and expectations to these new and experimental discussions, Bamsey encouraged a focus on creative thinking, open dialogue and concrete actions.",
      "He added that the outcome of the meeting, a report by the co-facilitators, would not represent a consensus text or decision, but would serve as input for consideration at COP 12 and COP 13. He explained that the workshop would begin with an initial exchange of views.",
      "This would be followed by a segment to exchange experiences and analyze strategic approaches for long-term cooperative action in four thematic areas. advancing development goals in a sustainable way; addressing action on adaptation; realizing the full potential of technology; and realizing the full potential of market-based opportunities.",
      "Following this, there would be an exchange of views and ideas on how to enable parties to continue developing appropriate national and international responses to climate change, promote research and investment, support action put forward voluntarily by developing countries, and promote access by developing countries to cleaner technologies and technologies for adaptation.",
      "The Dialogue would conclude with a discussion on future work and the focus of the second workshop."
