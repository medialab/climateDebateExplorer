      "From 16-18 July, delegates met in closed negotiating groups, which aimed to identify the key political issues to be resolved by ministers and high-level officials.",
      "Discussions during these three days were held on the basis of negotiating texts carried over from COP-6 Part I (see FCCC/CP/2000/5/Add.3, 'Part Three: Texts forwarded to the resumed sixth session by the COP at the first part of its sixth session,' Volumes I - V).",
      "These texts covered all issues under negotiation, although many paragraphs remained heavily bracketed.",
      "In addition, an unbracketed consolidated negotiating text proposed in June by President Pronk served as a key 'tool' for supporting the negotiations.",
      "This tool addressed critical areas where disagreements remain, and attempted to establish a balanced package of decisions on all issues covered by the BAPA."
