      "This section was taken up in plenary on Wednesday when a contact group was formed, co-chaired by Arthur Rolle (Bahamas) and Jean-Pascal van Ypersele (Belgium).",
      "The contact group discussed, among other issues: the difference between radiative forcing and effective radiative forcing; the difference between concentration-based and emission-based approaches to the reporting of radiative forcing; comparability of the analyses in AR4 and AR5; and accessibility of the text to policy makers.",
      "Delegates also addressed the appropriateness of Figure SPM.5, since it does not present uncertainties for individual components, and the figure was slightly amended to reflect this.",
      "The text agreed by the contact group was discussed by the WG on Thursday when van Ypersele explained that, although both concentration-based and emission-based approaches to reporting radiative forcing are used in the SPM, the latter are emphasized.",
      "The WG then approved the section in its entirety."
