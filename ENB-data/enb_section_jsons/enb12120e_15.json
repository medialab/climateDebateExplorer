      "The G-77/CHINA highlighted insufficient financial resources to meet the 'agreed full costs' in the preparation of non-Annex I communications. In addition, Parties highlighted the need for: a financial mechanism to assist SIDS in achieving adaptive capacity; strong leadership from Annex I countries in taking responsibility for action on climate change; and a meeting to explore the needs of Parties with economies in transition. As of 8:00 pm, approximately 50 speakers were scheduled to address the Plenary."
