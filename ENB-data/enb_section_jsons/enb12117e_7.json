      "This contact group continued discussing the need for data and information in relation to consideration of the IPCC Special Report and a decision-making framework in the context of Protocol requirements.",
      "On reporting formats, some delegates noted that guidelines for the provision of data relating to Article 3.3 (net changes in GHG emissions and removals) were already provided for by the IPCC 1996 guidelines and said Parties should abide by them.",
      "Others considered that additional and more specific data and information were needed.",
      "Timing, application and criteria for data under Articles 3.3 and 3.4 (additional human-induced activities relating to changes in emissions and removals) and 3.7 (assigned amounts and LULUCF as a net source of emissions) were discussed.",
      "The group identified transparency, verifiability, accounting for uncertainties and attribution as criteria under Articles 3.4 and attempted to identify additional criteria including: measurability; permanence; prevention of perverse incentives; avoidance of double accounting; symmetry; conformity with the FCCC, the Protocol and other conventions; and the 'leakage effect."
