      "The 40th session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-40) met from 27 October to 1 November 2014, in Copenhagen, Denmark, to consider and finalize the Synthesis Report and Summary for Policymakers that complete the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).",
      "More than 800 authors and review editors from 85 countries participated in the preparation of AR5 over the past six years, and concluded that: climate change is unequivocal and unprecedented; substantial and sustained emission reductions are needed to avoid the most serious consequences; and the more we delay action, the more costly it will be and the more we will have to rely on untested technologies in the future."
