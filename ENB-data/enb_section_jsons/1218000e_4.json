      "The Chair of the budget consultations, Mahmoud Ould El Ghaouth, said that a small number of political decisions remain that will affect the Convention budget for the biennium 1996-1997 (FCCC/CP/1995/L.4), and that their resolution will require completion of the budget figures.",
      "The document contains no figures for contributions from the host government, which will depend on the physical location of the Permanent Secretariat.",
      "It also has blanks for administration overhead and the year-end balance from voluntary funds.",
      "El Ghaouth also presented the draft decisions on extrabudgetary funding for the interim secretariat for 1995 (FCCC/CP/1995/L.7) and other voluntary funding for the biennium 1996-1997 (FCCC/CP/1995/L.8) for consideration. At the suggestion of France, a footnote was added to L.4 explaining that the working capital reserve amounted to 8.3% of the operating budget, equivalent to one month's budget.",
      "A US recommendation to change a reference in L.8 from a 'special voluntary fund' into a 'special fund' was also agreed.",
      "The Executive Secretary indicated that the rules describe a special fund with voluntary contributions, but that the amendment would not make the contribution an assessed one.",
      "The documents were recommended to the COP for adoption."
