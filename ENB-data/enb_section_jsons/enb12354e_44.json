      "In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2007/L.16), SBSTA notes the workshops held during SBSTA 24, 25 and 27, and the useful initial exchange of information and experiences.",
      "The SBSTA also notes that mitigation is being addressed by other bodies and processes under the Convention and Protocol, including agenda items on IPCC AR4, the AWG, and long-term cooperative action to address climate change under the Convention.",
      "Finally, the SBSTA agrees to continue consideration of this subject at SBSTA 28, and invites parties to submit their views on possible future work under this item by 15 March 2008.",
      "Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transport: This agenda item, also referred to as the bunker fuels issue, was taken up in SBSTA plenary on Tuesday, 4 December.",
      "The EU, Tuvalu, and Norway, opposed by Saudi Arabia, suggested a contact group on this issue.",
      "Norway briefed delegates on a recent technical workshop in Oslo (see http://www.iisd.ca/crs/sdosl ). SBSTA Chair Krishan Kumarsingh conducted brief informal consultations on this issue together with consultations on the agenda item on Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures), which was also the subject of a dispute among similar groups of parties (see the discussion on Article 2.3 on page 13).",
      "However, no progress was made on either issue, and the item will be included on the provisional agenda of SBSTA 28.",
      "Technical review of greenhouse gas inventories from Annex I parties: The SBSTA first took up this issue on 4 December (FCCC/SBSTA/2007/INF.4).",
      "It was then the subject of informal consultations facilitated by Anke Herold (European Community) and Nagmeldin Elhassan (Sudan).",
      "These consultations resulted in agreement on short draft SBSTA conclusions, which were adopted by the SBSTA on 11 December."
