      "Although negotiations on these issues were completed at COP-6 Part II, they are part of the 'package' to be adopted at COP-7 once all outstanding texts have been finalized and approved. Other issues to be considered at COP-7 include input to the World Summit on Sustainable Development and a second review of the adequacy of UNFCCC Article 4.2 (a) and (b) (review of commitments)."
