   "sentences": [
      "As the Barcelona Climate Change Talks drew to a close on Friday, 6 November, just 30 days remained before Copenhagen.",
      "With this impending deadline and zero negotiating days left, negotiators, NGOs, the media and other climate trackers were looking towards one of the most-anticipated international conferences in recent memory.",
      "The negotiations are taking place against the backdrop of unprecedented global attention and intense media coverage on climate change from the highest political echelons right down to the man on the street.",
      "The world s leaders have also emphasized their commitment to a successful outcome in Copenhagen, and roughly 40 heads of state and government are expected to attend the conference.",
      "Yet, in recent months, expectations for Copenhagen have been increasingly downplayed, with many leaders and other pundits publicly voicing that the prospect of Copenhagen delivering a legally-binding outcome is extremely slim.",
      "Many felt that the Barcelona meeting amplified these sentiments, as well as divergent interests, polarization, frustration and mistrust between developed and developing countries.",
      "Against this backdrop, this analysis will focus specifically on the prospects and possible alternatives for a Copenhagen outcome. DEFLATING COPENHAGEN?",
      "The goal of the resumed seventh session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the UNFCCC (AWG-LCA) in Barcelona was to come up with streamlined negotiating text and identify clear alternatives that would shape and generate momentum for an agreed outcome in Copenhagen, as envisaged in the Bali Action Plan (BAP).",
      "Many also hoped that the pace of negotiations would accelerate on the key elements of the BAP, namely: mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and capacity building, as well as a shared vision for long-term cooperative action.",
      "However, at the close of the meeting, views on movement varied and progress under the different building blocks was described by many as uneven.",
      "While some contact groups were able to streamline and consolidate options, others saw very little change between text coming into and text going out of Barcelona.",
      "Indeed, many delegates admitted that we could be doing better.",
      "Acknowledging the enormity of work remaining, some felt that Barcelona clarified a set of choices, and progressed in discussing more of what countries need rather than what they want, enabling the contours of a potential outcome in Copenhagen to emerge.",
      "Under the Ad Hoc Working Group on further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP), the plan was to further streamline text and provide clear options on issues such as the flexibility mechanisms and LULUCF.",
      "In particular, many were urging progress on numbers - the scale of Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reduction targets - which, according to the work programme, should have been adopted at AWG-KP 7 in March 2009 and AWG-KP 8 in June 2009, respectively.",
      "However, coming into Barcelona, few realistically expected this to happen, although many did continue to hold out hope for a radical change from previous sessions.",
      "Many developing countries and environmental NGOs called for Annex I parties to scale up their emission reduction pledges in order to bridge the gap between the pledges on the table and what the science requires to prevent dangerous climate change.",
      "Developed countries, however, continued to stress the need to reach agreement on the means to reach emission reduction targets, including the flexibility mechanisms as well as land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), before finalizing the numbers.",
      "They also emphasized the need to consider mitigation in a broader context, saying that agreement on their new commitments under the Protocol without the US and major developing countries will not be enough to meet the demands of science.",
      "This led to a standoff, with the African Group calling for a suspension of work in other AWG-KP contact groups until the numbers group completed its work.",
      "Some acknowledged that it did give the issue increased political visibility and it certainly brought about increased press coverage during the week.",
      "Others, however, questioned the African Group s tactics, noting that this did not result in a noticeable change in the Barcelona outcome."
