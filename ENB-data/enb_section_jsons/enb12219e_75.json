      "Although Parties agree on the regime\u0092s ultimate objective, SB-18 provided an important opportunity for Parties to continue discussions on several issues with the potential to affect the regime\u0092s future direction.",
      "These included adverse effects, P&Ms and the IPCC TAR. Agreeing to a common course of action on adverse affects and on P&Ms was not an easy task and Parties failed to reach substantive conclusions.",
      "General differences in the perspectives of developed and developing countries were only one reason for the lack of progress.",
      "Another was the G-77/China\u0092s frequent inability to develop and present unified positions. Discussions on adverse effects began as expected, with developed country Parties arguing that significant progress has been made in addressing adverse effects, and developing countries arguing the opposite.",
      "As discussions wore on, OPEC countries used their usual tactic of insisting on the link between adaptation to climate change and adaptation to response measures.",
      "Many observers interpret OPEC\u0092s demand for compensation for the adverse effects of response measures as akin to 'penalizing compliance' with emissions mitigation commitments.",
      "Other developing countries argued specifically for action regarding adaptation to climate change, seemingly concerned that OPEC\u0092s tactic would prevent progress and perpetuate the longstanding impasse on adverse effects.",
      "Developed countries certainly continued to resist any link between the two kinds of adverse effects, and were unwilling to use the reports of recent workshops on these issues as a basis for further action.",
      "As a consequence, the next steps on adaptation remain obscure. With respect to P&Ms, several Annex I Parties suggested that information exchange could benefit all Parties, and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer.",
      "Saudi Arabia, speaking for the G-77/China, argued that text should not directly or indirectly encourage non-Annex I Parties to share information.",
      "However, at least one member of the G-77/China said that it did not share Saudi Arabia\u0092s perspective. Ultimately, negotiations broke down when Saudi Arabia, again on behalf of the G-77/China, refused the EU and Japan\u0092s demand that a sentence explicitly requiring information exchange on ways to minimize the adverse effects of response measures be deleted.",
      "One observer speculated that the US was largely silent on this matter because it is not planning to implement policies and measures with significant adverse effects.",
      "Parties agreed only to discuss P&Ms again at SB-19, and although the Saudi Arabian delegate said he looked forward to 'a new era of cooperation' on the issue, another delegate described P&Ms as a 'dead end.",
      "' Discussions on next steps in the consideration of the IPCC TAR, meanwhile, did result in substantive conclusions.",
      "Although developing countries were united on this issue, for a while developed countries were split on whether to address, at future SBSTA sessions, aspects of mitigation and of adaptation as one or two distinct agenda items.",
      "Developing countries were opposed to a single agenda item, which would link the consideration of adaptation and of mitigation, because they believe that mitigation is the sole responsibility of Annex I Parties.",
      "Parties agreed a delicate compromise to establish two new agenda items, but also to take note of 'possible links' in future discussions.",
      "Annex I Parties, including Russia, were reportedly satisfied, even though it is not clearly specified that the possible links to be taken note of refer to those between mitigation and adaptation."
