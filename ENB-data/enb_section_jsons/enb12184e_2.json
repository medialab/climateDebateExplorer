      "The negotiating group convened in the morning for a full reading of all texts, which had been revised to incorporate changes agreed in the drafting groups.",
      "A paper on previously agreed guidelines for national systems under Article 5.1 (national systems) was distributed and an editorial amendment agreed.",
      "Delegates then agreed on the COP-7 and COP/MOP-1 draft decisions on Article 5.1.",
      "In the COP/MOP-1 decision on Article 5.2 (adjustments), delegates left open whether a disagreement between a Party and the expert review team (ERT) regarding an adjustment should be forwarded to the COP/MOP or only to the Compliance Committee. In the draft COP-7 and COP/MOP-1 decisions on guidelines under Article 7, delegates deferred consideration of issues related to Article 7.4 (modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts) and LULUCF, as relevant issues were still being dealt with by other groups. Delegates then considered the Article 7 guidelines.",
      "On Part I, Reporting of Supplementary Information under Article 7.1 (inventories), several sections were agreed, however the section on greenhouse gas inventory information remained bracketed pending LULUCF outcomes.",
      "The section on information on additions to and subtractions from assigned amounts remained in brackets pending Article 7.4 outcomes.",
      "The section on minimization of adverse impacts under Article 3.14 (adverse effects) was not agreed, with SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by JAPAN and others, suggesting that Parties 'shall' rather than 'are requested to' provide information. Under Part II, Reporting of Supplementary Information under Article 7.2 (national communications), the section on national registries was left unresolved pending conclusions from the group on Article 7.4.",
      "AUSTRALIA proposed deleting a bracketed section on reporting on mechanisms projects, noting that this would be covered under Article 7.4.",
      "Text on joint fulfillment was left in brackets.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA advocated retaining bracketed text regarding reporting on Article 2.3 (adverse effects of P&Ms), while SAMOA supported retaining text on reporting on national arrangements to ensure that LULUCF activities contribute to conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of natural resources. Parties then turned to the guidelines for review under Article 8, beginning with a textual proposal by the EU, Japan and Australia for the COP/MOP decision, deciding to start the annual review in the year following the submission of the report.",
      "On timing and procedures under Part I, General Approach to Review, JAPAN suggested inserting text that addresses review for reinstatement of eligibility to use mechanisms.",
      "On ERTs and institutional arrangements, informal group Chair Festus Luboyera (South Africa) reported that most paragraphs had been approved, but that some additional language was being drafted to address the outstanding issues, such as on competence of participating experts.",
      "Parties left Part III, Review of Information on Assigned Amounts, bracketed pending outcomes from consultations.",
      "On Part VI, Review of National Communications and Information on Other Commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, CHINA requested that the scope of the review include examination of financial resources separately from technology transfer. Drafting groups continued their work on Saturday into the night, focusing on the outstanding issues referred to them by the negotiating group.",
      "The group on LULUCF considered at length the issue of reporting on areas of land, without arriving at a final conclusion."
