      "This is a key issue for the EU, which at SB-13 urged the establishment of a 'consultative process' to promote information exchange and experience on P&Ms, facilitate cooperation between Parties, and contribute to the assessment of demonstrable progress.",
      "By the end of the second week, a draft decision supportive of its stance had been weakened and heavily bracketed by the Umbrella Group and Saudi Arabia, the former by deleting any meaningful reference to demonstrable progress, and bracketing the list of measures aimed at improving the transparency, effectiveness and comparability of P&Ms, and the latter by insisting on a role for OPEC regarding P&Ms.",
      "The EU again appeared to be unable to successfully defend its position, leading one observer to comment that 'what was once a cornerstone in the climate negotiations has becomes a symbol of the crisis in international cooperation on climate change.",
      "' According to some, the apparent inability of the EU to negotiate effectively in this sphere means that this issue may be the only one that is easily resolved at COP-6."
