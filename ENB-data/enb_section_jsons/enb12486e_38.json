      "In its decision, the IPCC: decided to improve the IPCC guidance on evaluation of evidence and treatment of uncertainty and to implement the IAC Review recommendations as part of a broader package of updates to procedures and guidance notes; requested the WG Co-Chairs to present the final document for adoption by the Panel at IPCC-33; noted the document should provide more detail on traceable accounts and explain how each of the recommendations in the IAC Review is addressed; and urged the WG Co-Chairs to take any necessary steps to ensure that the guidance is implemented in the development of their work."
