      "In what was perhaps an unfortunate mix of metaphors, a delegate speaking during negotiations on the mechanisms expressed confidence in Pronk's ability to successfully manage the 'Titanic endeavor' of 'navigating delegates through a sea of brackets.",
      "' The irony of his wording was not lost on delegates, many of whom were already speculating that a credible agreement would be sunk by the conflicting demands of strongly competing vested interests.",
      "Many expressed the hope, however, that Pronk - no stranger to the delicate art of international environmental negotiations - would be able to manage this monumental task.",
      "While initial views on Pronk's performance over the week were conflicting, Pronk's ability at the end of the day to steer a course between Parties' competing interests, and to bring key negotiators together, appeared to have been appreciated by many of the high level participants."
