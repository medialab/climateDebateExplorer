   "sentences": [
      "Chair Ra\u00fal Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) opened the seventh session of the AGBM on 31 July and noted that as COP-3 approached, he remained optimistic despite expected difficulties.",
      "He noted that the G-7+1 meeting in Denver and UNGASS demonstrated new interest in climate change.",
      "He pointed out that despite some criticism of the scope of the Berlin Mandate, AGBM is not competent to change it.",
      "He noted that under the FCCC, developed countries committed themselves to take the lead in reducing emissions, and not until this occurred could developing countries assume greater responsibilities.",
      "He acknowledged progress toward an agreement, and pointed to the EU commitment and proposal as a step forward.",
      "He noted that two Parties\u0092 target definitions would be crucial. FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit-Cutajar indicated that, at Kyoto he expected a clear agreement on the understanding of Annex I country commitments under the FCCC.",
      "The result from Kyoto should be a 'strong punch' against ' business as usual.",
      "' It should send a signal to the real economic actors that things would change in a way that is compatible both with their interests and with sustainable development.",
      "Although optimistic, he recognized the difficulty in reducing the proposals on the table to the sort of signal he described.",
      "He urged delegations to enter into a negotiating mode proving that they are able to go beyond 'playing with text.",
      "' TANZANIA, on behalf of the G-77/China, said that the basis for action and for an agreement must be strict adherence to the Convention and to the Berlin Mandate.",
      "He indicated that an agreement entailed advancing commitments for Annex I Parties while avoiding new ones for non-Annex I Parties.",
      "He referred to UNGASS outcomes, highlighting that in addition to establishing targets, there was widespread agreement that it will be necessary to take into account the adverse effects of response measures on all countries, especially developing ones. IPCC Chair Bert Bolin remarked on the Second Assessment Report (SAR), which states that 'the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.",
      "' He stated that enhanced GHG concentrations correspond to a change in global mean temperature of 0.7-2.1\u00ba C, but are limited to 0.2-1.1\u00ba C by aerosol concentrations and climate system inertia.",
      "He stated that global warming for the full range of IPCC emission scenarios and climate sensitivities was estimated to be in the range 1.0-3.5\u00ba C by the year 2100.",
      "He noted that recent analysis shows that Annex I countries were responsible for 64% of the total CO2 emissions in 1996, down from 75% in 1985.",
      "Although most of the increased emissions stem from non-Annex I countries, they will not reach 50% of the total emissions for another 15-20 years.",
      "He noted that stabilization of CO2 in the long-term requires efforts by all countries. LUXEMBOURG, on behalf of the EU, recalled its proposal that 'Annex X' Parties, individually or jointly, in accordance with the Berlin Mandate, should reduce emission levels for CO2, CH4 and N2O together (weighted total, using Global Warming Potential with a 100-year time horizon) by 2005 by at least 7.5% below 1990 levels.",
      "He also proposed that HFC, PFC and SF6 should be added no later than 2000 to the 'basket' of gases for these reduction objectives.",
      "He said that developed countries must face up to their responsibilities and take the lead.",
      "However, all Parties must realize that in the longer term an increasingly global effort is needed to tackle the issue. BRAZIL summarized its proposal (FCCC/AGBM/1997/MISC.1/Add.3) by calling for a direct and objective link to be established between the annual rate of GHG emissions and the increase in global mean surface temperature.",
      "He proposed that reduction targets be established in terms of temperature change.",
      "He called for the establishment of a mechanism to guarantee that non- Annex I countries address climate change.",
      "He called for the development of quantitative targets for non-Annex I countries as they reach appropriate levels of well-being.",
      "He proposed that the Clean Development Fund receive mandatory contributions from Annex I Parties in proportion to their overall non-compliance.",
      "He noted four points of negotiation: reduction targets of Annex I Parties expressed in temperature change; time of performance review for Annex I countries; initial year of consideration for historical emissions; and value of assessed contribution to the Clean Development Fund.",
      "He requested that the proposal be formally submitted to COP-3. ZIMBABWE, on behalf of the African Group, expressed hope that the AGBM will accelerate the negotiating process and reach agreement by the end of the next session.",
      "She noted that African countries are often marginalized by the interim funding mechanism process.",
      "She expressed concern with the lack of progress made in political deliberations and urged that the policies and measures and quantified emissions limitation and reduction objectives within specified time frames contain provisions for socio-economic impact assessments.",
      "She noted that any decision reached should not increase the socio-economic and environmental burdens placed on Africa.",
      "She stated that an agreement should include commitment of financial resources and technologies for African countries. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said the outcome should go through the same ratification process as the Convention and that CO2 reduction targets must be considered alongside goals for removal.",
      "SLOVENIA signaled its preparation to eventually join Annex I Parties in complying with legally binding commitments and supported an EU proposal for GHG reductions. The US said the AGBM agreement must: maintain legally binding targets; provide maximum flexibility; include credible and realistic levels; include mechanisms for national compliance; and involve all countries.",
      "He said it was not possible to decide what kind of numerical target might be undertaken without knowing what constraints would be imposed on such a target.",
      "The US had introduced proposals on emissions trading, joint implementation, a budget process and a banking process to increase flexibility and reduce costs.",
      "In this regard he outlined two new proposals, which he said are critical in determining the agreement structure.",
      "He explained that a legally binding agreement would require a compliance mechanism to which flexibility concepts could be added, although these were currently tinged with some political heat.",
      "He also called for a comprehensive approach including all GHGs, sources, sectors and sinks.",
      "Where countries failed to use the enabling IPCC methodology to adopt such an approach they should be penalized.",
      "On all-country participation, he called for an improved definition of Article 4.1 and the Berlin Mandate.",
      "He noted that while there is a difference between Annex I and non-Annex I countries, it was unreasonable to expect that nothing could be done between the Annex I and non-Annex I commitments.",
      "The US proposal includes a recommendation for a long-term process toward the objective of the Convention including all countries and seeking evolution.",
      "A new negotiation would certainly follow the AGBM, and within that timeframe all countries must participate. UZBEKISTAN said the countries with economies in transition require investment in new technologies. SAUDI ARABIA addressed contradictions in Annex I policies, such as increased fossil fuel production by developed countries in the event of lower consumption, leading to lower imports, and subsidies provided to some fossil fuel sectors while taxing the use of other fossil fuels.",
      "He asked for consideration of compensation in the event of negative economic impacts on some States. The Chair introduced the documentation, including the main negotiating text compiled at AGBM-6 (FCCC/AGBM/1997/3/Add.1) and proposals from Parties received after AGBM-6 (FCCC/AGBM/1997/MISC.1/Add.2,3,4, and 5).",
      "The Chair stated that delegates would meet in closed sessions and briefings for observers would be held each morning. The Chair then invited a number of Parties with new proposals to make presentations.",
      "JAPAN called for: a SBSTA study on the removal of carbon dioxide via sinks before the issue is taken up under QELROS; a review process to reflect the latest science; and for linkage between entry into force of an agreement and the total aggregate emissions of ratifying countries. GEORGIA called for improved financial mechanisms for the energy sector and encouragement of private sector participation in AIJ.",
      "SAMOA, on behalf of the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), outlined proposals to fully reflect the precautionary principle in the work of the AGBM.",
      "He said a guiding objective of the AGBM agreement should be to ensure that global sea level rise resulting from climate change does not exceed 20 cm above 1990 levels, and that the average global temperature does not exceed 2\u00baC above the pre-industrial level. In Plenary on 4 August, the Chairs of the non-group reported on their work to date.",
      "Delegates also heard presentations from NGOs, including the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, a representative from business and industry, and the Climate Action Network.",
      "JAPAN commented on an NGO report suggesting that Japan had proposed targets that would allow for large increases of CO2 emissions by Annex I countries by the year 2010.",
      "He stressed that Japan had not made such a proposal and reiterated Japan\u0092s position to reduce CO2 emissions to less than 1 ton per capita by the year 2100.",
      "The Chair of the OECD Expert Group on Annex I Countries indicated that the group sought to provide analytical support for AGBM."
