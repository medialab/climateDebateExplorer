   "sentences": [
      "Donald Lemmen, Natural Resources Canada, said risk perception and adaptive capacity vary.",
      "He noted that vulnerability to current climate at the local and regional level, and the engagement of decision makers are central to raising risk awareness. Lourdes Tibig, Philippine Atomspheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, said floods, tropical cyclones, storm surges, monsoon rains and droughts are primary risks to the Philippines.",
      "She outlined the risks of climate change to agriculture, food and health sectors, and coastal and water resources. Antonio Queface, Eduardo Mondlane University, Mozambique, described Mozambique\u0092s vulnerability to tropical cyclones, floods and droughts, which are aggravated by the country\u0092s geographical location, limited ability to forecast extreme events, reduced capability to adapt to natural disasters, and high climate variability. In the discussion, TUVALU asked if a group of risk insurance experts could advance the UNFCCC process.",
      "He also asked how models for risk assessment could be rendered meaningful at the local level.",
      "Lemmen suggested focusing on areas with highest vulnerability.",
      "NIUE asked how resilience could be increased.",
      "Lemmen responded that lessons could be learnt from the process of building resilience."
