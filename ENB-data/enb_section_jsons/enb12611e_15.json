      "On Wednesday, delegates engaged in a 'hands-on' mode of work both in ADP contact group sessions on the various elements of the future agreement, and in numerous meetings under the SBI and SBSTA.",
      "Many delegates continued to note the 'new' pattern of contact group and informal consultation management, with chairs finishing on time and then sending parties off to consult among themselves.",
      "This optimism was, however, overshadowed by a perceived lack of mutual confidence among parties.",
      "With positions and remaining points of contention clear on many issues, a sense of frustration grew in the corridors as many delegates raised concerns over the slow progress under the ADP.",
      "In the group on finance, parties that viewed the adjectives 'adequate' and 'predictable' as problematic were challenged to explain 'how inadequate and unpredictable finance could enhance climate action'.",
      "One seasoned delegate voiced a view shared by many: 'we know where we stand; it's high time we moved beyond the justify-your-position negotiating mode and built bridges'.",
      "In the ADP afternoon session, some parties' resistance to working with draft decision text on the screen was countered with a proposal to continue informal negotiations in Spanish.",
      "One delegate complained, 'parties need to build confidence and trust, not only to reach the mandated decision on INDCs in Lima, but also to make progress towards Paris'."
