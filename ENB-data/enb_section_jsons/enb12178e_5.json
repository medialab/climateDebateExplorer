      "A number of meetings and consultations were convened after COP-6 Part I in an effort to get negotiations back on track.",
      "In late June, President Pronk presented a consolidated negotiating text to delegates at informal high-level consultations held in Scheveningen, the Netherlands.",
      "The text was intended as a tool to help negotiators reach a compromise.",
      "However, while some participants expressed the opinion that positions did not appear to have shifted since COP-6 Part I, others suggested that positions had possibly widened on issues such as LULUCF, sinks in the CDM, and funding. In addition to official preparations for COP-6 Part II, there were a number of political developments following the meeting in The Hague.",
      "In March 2001, the US administration declared its opposition to the Protocol, stating that it believed it to be 'fatally flawed,' as it would damage its economy and exempted developing countries from fully participating."
