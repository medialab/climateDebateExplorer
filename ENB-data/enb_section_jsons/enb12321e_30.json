      "The WGII session, held in Brussels in the beginning of April, clearly revealed the underlying political tensions and complexity of the process.",
      "Originally scheduled to conclude on Thursday evening, the meeting did not end until Good Friday afternoon after an all-night session.",
      "The last two sections of the SPM were not even considered until 10:00 pm on the final day.",
      "The confusion and dragged manner of the negotiations prompted some participants to qualify it as one of the worst meetings they had ever attended.",
      "Political tensions were evident from the strong opposition by China and Saudi Arabia on tables linking climate change impacts to greenhouse gas concentration levels and timelines, which, in the end, were not included in the final SPM.",
      "Sections on regional climate change and paragraphs on global mean losses of GDP brought to the fore frictions between the US and European countries.",
      "Controversies also arose concerning specific reference to the UNFCCC. WGII was explicitly mandated to address UNFCCC Article 2 and, accordingly, authors had stated that assessment of potential key vulnerabilities was meant to provide guidance for identifying levels and rates of climate change that, in the terminology of the UNFCCC Article 2, could result from -\u0098dangerous anthropogenic interference' with the climate system.",
      "However, when the authors presented the text, the same IPCC that had mandated it opposed textual reference to the UNFCCC.",
      "Tensions at the WGII meeting culminated in a conflict between some delegations and Lead Authors.",
      "China and Saudi Arabia steadfastly opposed a confidence statement in which the authors had stated with very high confidence that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate change.",
      "Having explained their rationale various times and from various angles, the authors formally requested that their disagreement should be indicated in a footnote if the very high confidence statement was removed.",
      "This incident raised the stress level in the plenary, which broke into applause in support of one of the authors who left the room after presenting her disagreement in writing.",
      "One is left to wonder if a different system of valuing confidence levels and uncertainty would have been as prone to this kind of dismissal.",
      "And yet, for all the wrangling, the resulting WGII SPM is daunting in its presentation of the accumulated evidence that observed changes in many physical and biological systems are linked to anthropogenic warming.",
      "The impacts of these changes are projected to include hundreds of millions of people being exposed to increased water stress; many millions more people exposed to flooding every year; access to food in many African countries being severely compromised; and the likely extinction of 20-30% of plant and animal species with temperature rises exceeding 1.5-2.5 \u00b0C."
