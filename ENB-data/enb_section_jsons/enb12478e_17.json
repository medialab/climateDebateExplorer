      "The UN climate change negotiations are often depicted as a long road, where incremental steps will lead gradually to more resolute action and, ultimately, resolution of the problem.",
      "In this vision, each meeting is a small step, with major milestones, such as Kyoto, Marrakesh or Bali, marking the way forward.",
      "The process might be compared to Aesop s tortoise who slowly but tirelessly takes step after step to win the race against the faster but less focused hare.",
      "However, it is always useful to consider alternative narratives.",
      "An analogy to another animal can explain the process as well.",
