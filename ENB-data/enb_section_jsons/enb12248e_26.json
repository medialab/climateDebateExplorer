      "Coming into IPCC-22, there was widespread recognition that the Synthesis Report would be the main bone of contention for a variety of reasons.",
      "Indeed, even its preparation was in doubt, and formal and informal discussions on the Report\u0092s scope, length, content, and timing kept corridors and meeting rooms buzzing throughout IPCC-22, including through early morning, lunch and evening sessions.",
      "On timing, much of the deliberations centered on a goal of delivering the Report before UNFCCC COP-13, scheduled for November 2007.",
      "Many warned against an accelerated Synthesis Report process that may prioritize the political process over scientific quality.",
      "Others recalled that the UNFCCC is the IPCC\u0092s 'main customer,' and feared that if a Synthesis Report were not available, policymakers may rely on alternative interpretations of the three Working Groups\u0092 reports, thus not only weakening the significance of the IPCC\u0092s work, but also decoupling it from the UNFCCC process.",
      "As one participant put it, 'COP-13 is late; COP-14 is too late.",
      "' In the end, fears that a Synthesis Report would be evaded were alleviated, as participants agreed to a compromise proposal for a 30-page report with a five-page Summary for Policymakers to be approved by the IPCC in late October 2007.",
      "Through close consultations with Co-Chairs of the Working Groups and heads of the Technical Support Units, IPCC Chair R.K. Pachauri was able to instill considerable confidence that quality would not be sacrificed for the sake of expediency."
