      "The SBSTA also: decides to initiate as two agenda items the scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of adaptation, and of mitigation; invites Parties to submit, by 30 October 2003, their views on the elements, scope and priorities of the work to be undertaken under these two agenda items; requests the Secretariat to organize a pre-sessional consultation prior to SBSTA-19 with participation of the IPCC and others; and agrees that, in considering the two new agenda items, it will take note of the possible links between the scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of adaptation and mitigation, and the objectives of the UNFCCC and sustainable development."
