      "Despite the significant achievement in reaching political consensus, it became apparent towards the end of the Bonn meeting that not all Parties were 'maintaining the spirit of Monday's historic agreement.",
      "' This was most evident in the varying interpretations offered on the legally binding nature of the compliance regime.",
      "Some observers have questioned the motives behind the increasingly evident collaboration between Canada, the Russian Federation, Australia and Japan, even on issues upon which individual interests were not at stake. While it is unlikely that - in the words of Humphrey Bogart - the Bonn Agreement will necessarily be the beginning of a beautiful friendship, it is clear that it has laid the foundation for possible ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.",
      "In his closing statement, Ra\u00fal Estrada, one of the chief architects of the Kyoto Protocol, underlined that COP-6 Part II has brought a 'new dynamism to the Protocol process, and served to give new weight in our endeavors towards prompt ratification.",
      "' But as the disagreements in the final few days of the Bonn meeting showed, there is no guarantee just yet that the Protocol will be ratified, and if so, at what cost to its environmental integrity."
