      "Co-Chair R\u00f8nneberg (Marshall Islands), reported on 'informal informal' consultations on the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions of the JWG report on its work during SB-11, as well as the draft COP-5 decision on the JWG's future work.",
      "A number of delegates agreed to work on the basis of the Co-Chairs' proposals, while SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT and the UAE said these drafts did not reflect their concerns and sought to proceed on the basis of an earlier version.",
      "R\u00f8nneberg said the JWG would proceed on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis to consider the latest version of the Co-Chairs' draft. On a paragraph in the draft conclusions outlining progress at SB- 10 and SB-11, AUSTRALIA and the US suggested replacing 'procedures and mechanisms' relating to a compliance system with 'procedures and processes,' in order to include consideration of Protocol Articles 8 (expert review teams) and 16 (dispute settlement).",
      "SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by SAMOA, the EU, the US and NEW ZEALAND, proposed moving towards 'implementation of decision 8/CP4' (procedures and mechanisms on compliance) rather than towards 'negotiations.",
      "' R\u00f8nneberg then proceeded to hold informal consultations.",
      "Delegates agreed to two preambular paragraphs, but bracketed the paragraphs relating to convening a workshop and using the Co-Chairs' paper as a basis for the negotiation of a compliance system.",
      "A new bracketed paragraph was introduced on convening a sufficient number of sessions of the group prior to COP-6 to enable timely completion of work.",
      "In considering the draft decision, delegates agreed to the preambular paragraphs and debated, inter alia, whether the JWG should 'complete its work' or 'make substantial progress' at COP-6.",
      "The JWG will continue consultations."
