      "In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.15), the SBSTA, inter alia : - advances its work on the draft UNFCCC Annex I inventory guidelines, including common reporting format (CRF) tables, and agrees to continue its discussions at SBSTA 39, with a view to forwarding a draft decision to COP 19; - identifies the need to consider at SBSTA 39 the reporting of CO2 emissions related to ammonia production and urea application, and supplementary guidelines on wetlands and invited parties to submit views on these matters; - notes that the completion of the CRF Reporter, at the latest in June 2014, is critical for parties to use for submission of their national inventories in 2015, and requests the Secretariat to continue to update the Reporter with a view to making it available to parties for testing in the fourth quarter of 2013; and - notes that there may be differences in reporting emissions/removals from harvested wood products due to the alternative approaches to estimate the contribution of such products to annual emissions/removals, and agrees to continue discussions on this matter at SBSTA 39."
