      "The spacious corridors of the impressive new Tianjin Meijiang Convention and Exhibition Center were remarkably subdued on the opening day of the Tianjin Climate Change Talks, with weary negotiators complaining of meeting fatigue and grumbling that there did not appear to be an end in sight.",
      "Many negotiators appeared resigned to the inevitability of not obtaining a legally-binding agreement before COP 17 in South Africa, as they discussed what a balanced set of decisions for COP 16 could look like.",
      "We need to know what we are going to forward to the COP and COP/MOP before we get to Cancun, remarked one delegate, we have to learn from the chaos of Copenhagen.",
      "Another noted that while many of us think that we need to move past the mantra of nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, it is going to be difficult to find common ground on what the set of decisions will be.",

      "Anyway, let s wait and see one commented, we never can tell, there may be some surprises in store for us."
