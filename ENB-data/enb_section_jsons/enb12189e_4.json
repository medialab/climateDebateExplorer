      "COP-6 and the resumed thirteenth sessions of the UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies were held in The Hague, the Netherlands, from 13-25 November 2000.",
      "During the second week of negotiations, COP-6 President Jan Pronk, Minister of Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment of the Netherlands, attempted to facilitate progress on the many disputed political and technical issues by convening high-level informal Plenary sessions to address the key political issues, which he grouped into four 'clusters' or 'boxes,' as follows: (a) capacity building, technology transfer, adverse effects and guidance to the financial mechanism; (b) mechanisms; (c) land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF); and, (d) compliance, policies and measures (P&Ms), and accounting, reporting and review under Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information). By Thursday, 23 November, negotiations appeared stalled, and President Pronk distributed a Note containing his proposals on key issues in an attempt to encourage a breakthrough.",
      "After almost 36 hours of intense talks on the President's proposals, negotiators could not achieve an agreement, with financial issues, supplementarity in the use of the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF proving to be particular sticking points.",
      "On Saturday afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk announced that delegates had failed to reach agreement.",
      "Delegates agreed to suspend COP-6, and resume their work in 2001. A number of meetings and consultations were convened after COP-6 Part I in an effort to get negotiations back on track.",
      "In addition in March 2001, the US declared its opposition to the Protocol, stating that it believed it to be 'fatally flawed,' as it would damage its economy and exempted developing countries from fully participating."
