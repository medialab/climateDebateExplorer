      "With COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA and IRAN, he noted they are supplemental to domestic action.",
      "SOUTH AFRICA and IRAN noted that COP-4 cannot finalize work on setting modalities and guidelines for the mechanisms.",
      "SLOVENIA reiterated the urgency of action, calling for the proposed working groups to provide sufficient input to COP-4 on the elaboration of modalities, rules and guidelines. AUSTRALIA, supported by RUSSIA, called for cost-effective mechanisms and said that credits should be transferable across the three mechanisms for the achievement of the Protocol\u0092s aims.",
      "The EU said the AIJ experience gained since COP-1 can provide valuable guidance on questions of flexibility mechanisms in the Protocol.",
      "He proposed that SBSTA\u0092s work program at COP-4 include follow-up to the June 1998 reporting deadline.",
      "ARGENTINA stressed the importance of setting COP-4\u0092s priorities and suggested moving on those issues, such as the CDM, where consensus has been achieved. GEORGIA cautioned that CDM, in its current form, makes developing countries dependent on the will of developed countries and said there is a need for financial resources to assist developing countries.",
      "MAURITIUS emphasized CDM for poverty alleviation and ETHIOPIA called for elaboration on this at COP-4.",
      "With COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, SLOVENIA, SENEGAL, NIGERIA, and IRAN, NORWAY called CDM a tool for sustainable development in non-Annex I countries that should also contribute to climate change objectives.",
      "He said additional time is needed for inclusion of sinks in CDM. COLOMBIA and VENEZUELA recommended that CDM projects, inter alia, produce real emissions reductions and, with COSTA RICA, accord with host country wishes.",
      "Supported by COSTA RICA, NICARAGUA, ARGENTINA and IRAN, COLOMBIA opposed ignoring sinks, noting that they are also biodiversity deposits.",
      "COSTA RICA also opposed re-negotiation on what kinds of sinks are included.",
      "KOREA expressed reservations about the inclusion of forestry under CDM and cautioned against the temptation to micromanage CDM through extended bureaucracies.",
      "IRAN distinguished CDM from other mechanisms as a multilateral rather than bilateral mechanism, with international supervision.",
      "He cautioned against turning CDM into a clean energy mechanism.",
      "URUGUAY called for further definition and contact group discussions. The AFRICAN GROUP, supported by SOUTH AFRICA, noted that African countries have neither participated in AIJ nor received funding because donors seem to prefer other regions.",
      "Several countries, such as BURKINA FASO, NIGERIA and the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, stressed the need to wait until the end of the AIJ pilot phase before drawing conclusions on its viability.",
      "IRAN favored continuation of the AIJ pilot phase and development of guidelines for it. KOREA and NIGERIA stressed that emissions trading should supplement national reductions and cautioned that rules to govern it must be defined in advance to avoid compliance and verification problems.",
      "CHINA noted that emissions trading is illegal until the COP defines relevant rules, principles, and guidelines.",
      "Supporting emissions trading, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION said the Russian people had paid a very high price for 'hot air' by reducing their living standards. CANADA tabled a discussion paper on principles, modalities, rules and guidelines for an international emissions trading regime on behalf of Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia and the US.",
      "The tradable unit would be Assigned Amount Units (AAUs).",
      "AAUs would be denominated in 'CO2 equivalent' and would express one metric tonne of CO2 equivalent emissions.",
      "Each Annex B Party could issue serialized AAUs from its 'assigned amounts.",
      "' AAUs would be valid until used to offset emissions for the purposes of contributing to compliance. Parties could trade directly and/or authorize legal entities to acquire and or transfer AAUs.",
      "Each Annex B Party would need to comply with Article 5 (national emission estimation systems) and Article 7 (emissions inventories).",
      "They must also establish and maintain a national system for recording their 'assigned amounts' and tracking AAUs held, transferred or acquired.",
      "Each Party would also be required to report annually on activities and be assessed for compliance at the end of the commitment period. The Chair announced the terms of reference for a joint SBSTA/SBI contact group to prepare a draft decision(s) on: the division of labor for forthcoming SBI and SBSTA sessions; substantive issues regarding AIJ, JI, the CDM, and emissions trading; and elaboration of a work programme."
