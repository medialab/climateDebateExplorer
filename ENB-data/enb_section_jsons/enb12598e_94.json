      "The ADP meetings drew a lot of time and attention and, against this flashy kaleidoscope, the agendas of the SBI and SBSTA were viewed as 'necessary, but not fun'.",
      "Parties continued implementation work on various issues with varying degrees of success.",
      "Agriculture fared well, with parties identifying specific areas for future work, which the G-77/China called 'a roadmap to COP 22'.",
      "Progress on other agenda items was less tangible.",
      "Initial work under the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage on the composition and procedures of its Executive Committee was painstakingly slow, with AOSIS in the SBI closing plenary asking for 'more time, attention and expeditious efforts in Lima'.",
      "The leftover issues under REDD+, such as methodologies for non-market approaches and for non-carbon benefits proved sticky, and were deferred to Lima.",
      "While work under the SBI and SBSTA appeared to be slowly, if steadily advancing, delegates could not shake off the feeling that the subsidiary bodies were merely third violins to the ADP.",
      "It is well known that implementation issues do not receive much political attention, and with issues such as loss and damage, response measures, market approaches and REDD+, surfacing in the ADP's discussions, some were left wondering whether parties introduced them under the ADP to give them more visibility.",
      "Yet, although the relationship between the ongoing implementation work under the Convention and Kyoto Protocol on the one hand, and negotiations towards the 2015 agreement on the other, may not necessarily be straightforward, it takes two to tango.",
      "An effective post-2020 climate regime requires the sound implementation of existing rules, as well as the ability to implement the rules still to be determined."
