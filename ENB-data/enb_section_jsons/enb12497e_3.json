      "The Secretariat explained that the Chair had ruled at the end of the informal consultations that the text was clear and ready to come to the contact group, while also reminding delegates that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that the entire text therefore remains in brackets.",
      "Going through the text, parties agreed on all paragraphs apart from paragraph 52 on the Executive Board revising the procedures for CDM project registration to allow the crediting period to start from the date that a complete request for registration has been submitted, which was bracketed at the request of Bolivia.",
      "PAPUA NEW GUINEA stressed that the paragraph relates to his country s proposal and suggested leaving it bracketed without further informal consultations, saying they were unlikely to yield results.",
      "Parties also discussed three annexes to the draft COP/MOP decision.",
      "BOLIVIA requested bracketing all of them, saying parties had not had time to analyze them and also noting concerns about issues related to code of conduct and conflict of interest.",
      "JAPAN stressed the enormous effort to provide text in the annexes to everyone a month before the meeting, and that the annexes were adopted two days ago.",
      "BOLIVIA underscored the importance of environmental integrity, and indicated that the bracketed paragraph is only meant to make more money with the CDM and for the investors without helping the climate.",
      "Co-Chair Shimada indicated that all annexes remain in brackets.",
      "Informal consultations continued."
