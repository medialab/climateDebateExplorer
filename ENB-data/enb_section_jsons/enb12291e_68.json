      "This decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.1) includes principles that govern the treatment of LULUCF activities, an annex establishing rules and guidelines for the first commitment period, and an appendix.",
      "Principles include the exclusion of carbon stocks from accounting, clarifying that accounting for LULUCF activities does not imply a transfer of commitments to a future commitment period, and that the reversal of any removal due to LULUCF activities must be accounted for at the appropriate time.",
      "The guidelines in the annex include, for example, that Annex I Parties may account in the first commitment period afforestation, reforestation and deforestation activities from 1990 to 2012, up to a maximum amount determined in the appendix, times five; and credits arising from CDM projects on afforestation and reforestation amounting to up to 'one per cent of base year emissions times five.",
