      "The contact group on sinks chaired by Antonio la Vi\u00f1a (Philippines) met in the morning to discuss a Chair's draft on sinks.",

      "It refers to 'verifiable changes .",
      "resulting from direct human induced land-use change and forestry activities since 1990' to achieve compliance.",
      "The sinks would be limited to a verifiable change in stocks covered in the land-use change and forestry sector of the IPCC guidelines. Delegates reiterated divergent, previously stated positions about whether or how to include sinks in QELROs.",
      "They debated the meaning of a number of terms included in the Chair's draft, with some noting that 'new' and 'direct' appeared vague.",
      "Concern was also raised with the reference to 1990 as a base year.",
      "No agreement was reached, and the contact group resumed an evening session to develop recommendations to the QELROs negotiating group."
