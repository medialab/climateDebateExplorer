      "On Tuesday, delegates met for the first time in spin-off groups.",
      "Some welcomed the development, and hoped that the smaller, more informal groups would quicken the pace and generate clear options or even bridging proposals on key issues, including differentiation.",
      "Meanwhile, other delegates felt beleaguered by the proliferation of informal meetings, especially those on small delegations, in part due to the lack of funds available in the Trust Fund for Participation.",
      "One delegate was found lamenting \u201cthere are more meetings happening this afternoon than people on my delegation.\u201d By the end of the spin-off groups\u2019 first day, mitigation negotiators became bogged down by debates over the usefulness of such groups.",
      "Commenting that she had been hopeful for progress at the start of the facilitated group, one observer lamented that negotiators \u201cmarched right into the quicksand of procedural debates.\u201d The promise of the spin-off groups is nascent, but many left the conference center hoping they can deliver much-needed progress on the \u201cstill too long and complicated\u201d text."
