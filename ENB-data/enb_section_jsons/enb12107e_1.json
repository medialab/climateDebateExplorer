      "On the draft conclusions on research and systematic observation (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.2), the EU requested deleting the paragraph on SBSTA\u0092s invitation to GEF to include, in its report to the COP, the specific steps it has taken to implement the provisions of paragraph 1(c) of decision 2/CP.4 (guidance to the operating entity of the financial mechanism), stating that it was addressed elsewhere.",
      "CHINA, supported by the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, said important decisions sometimes have to be reiterated until they are implemented.",
      "The US stated that, if included, the paragraph should reflect the whole decision and not just a part of it.",

      "Delegates adopted the draft conclusions as amended. Regarding the draft conclusions on the work programme on methodological issues related to Protocol Articles 5 (methodologies), 7 (communication), and 8 (review of information) (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.3), the EU requested changing the date of submission from 15 August to 15 September to allow time for preparation.",
      "Chair Chow said the current deadline meant Parties could receive the compiled views prior to COP-5.",
      "Delegates adopted the draft conclusions without any amendments."
