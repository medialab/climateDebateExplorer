      "After nearly two weeks of intensive deliberations, many felt deflated as, on day 10 of the COP, the ADP seemed to lose momentum, with over 50 pages of bracketed text and no agreement on the way forward in sight.",
      "A mysterious draft decision document, which made a brief appearance on the ADP website in the morning, circulated broadly among delegates.",
