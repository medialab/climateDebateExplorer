      "For the AWG-LCA, the first part of 2009 focused on developing draft negotiating text.",
      "This process resulted in a text that was nearly 200 pages long and covered all the main elements of the BAP.",
      "Because of the length of the text, delegates began producing non-papers, reading guides, tables and matrices aimed at making the negotiating text more manageable.",
      "The outcome was a series of non-papers, forwarded to Copenhagen as an annex to the meeting report.",
      "Heading into Copenhagen, many felt the AWG-LCA had made satisfactory progress on adaptation, technology and capacity building, but that deep divides remained on mitigation and certain aspects of finance."
