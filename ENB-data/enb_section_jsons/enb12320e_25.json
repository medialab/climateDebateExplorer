      "The final text on Section D on responding to climate change finds that some adaptation to observed and projected future climate change is occurring now, but on a limited basis.",
      "It indicates that adaptation will be necessary to address impacts of already unavoidable warming, identifies the availability of a wide array of adaptation options and stresses that more extensive adaptation is required than is currently occurring.",
      "It states that barriers, limits and costs exist but are not fully understood.",
      "The text indicates that vulnerability to climate change can be exacerbated by the presence of other stresses, and that future vulnerability depends not only on climate change but also on development pathways.",
      "It explains that sustainable development can reduce vulnerability to climate change, and that climate change could impede nations \u0092 abilities to achieve sustainable development pathways.",
      "The text states that many impacts can be avoided, reduced or delayed by mitigation and that a portfolio of adaptation and mitigation measures can diminish the risks associated with climate change.",
      "It clarifies that impacts of climate change will vary regionally but are very likely to impose net annual costs, increasing over time with temperature rise."
