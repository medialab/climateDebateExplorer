      "Francis Zwiers, Canada, said the group identified that to facilitate adaptation, high quality climatic and non-climatic data was required, and recommended that countries should: catalogue and evaluate their climatic and non-climatic data holdings, to assess: the adequacy of networks; the practicality of collecting, organizing and documenting local and traditional knowledge; the efficacy of data collection, quality control and documentation systems; the accessibility of data to users; and the extent to which datasets talk to each other (that is, the ease with which multidisciplinary teams using this data can access and interlink various types of data needed for adaptation); use their assessments to develop integrated management and collection systems that can provide the information needed for adaptation; train multidisciplinary teams of experts in the data and observations needed for adaptation and on interpreting and communicating this data to policy and decision makers, and other users; ensure a continuing dialogue between the scientific adaptation research and development community and the policy and decision makers; ensure that their data and information systems include assessment and documentation of uncertainties; and when communicating information obtained from observations, communicate information that is deemed essentially free of uncertainty, which can then be used to inform adaptation decisions."
