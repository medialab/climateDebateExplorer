      "Delegates breathed a sigh of relief as the COP agenda was adopted smoothly on Monday morning, confirming that the ghosts of the stalled SBI session in June 'were exorcized'.",
      "According to rumors, this was a close call, as agreement on the inclusion of the new agenda item on decision-making in the UNFCCC process had been reached minutes before the opening ceremony.",
      "Some lamented, however, that the painless adoption of the heavily loaded agenda had been marred by two hours of opening statements.",
      "As a result, no time was left for opening statements under the SBSTA in the evening.",
      "While the adoption of the agenda did not create any drama, the COP opening plenary was nonetheless highly emotional with many evoking the devastation caused by typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, Viet Nam and other countries in the region.",
      "A powerful speech by Nadrev Sa\u00f1o, the Climate Change Commissioner from the Philippines, brought tears to the eyes of many, as he announced that, in solidarity with his people, he would voluntarily fast until the COP reaches a meaningful outcome and delivers real ambition on climate action."
