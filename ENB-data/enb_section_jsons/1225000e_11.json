      "Andrea Williams-Stewart reported that the annual meeting of the South Pacific Forum took place in Papua New Guinea two months ago, where the concerns of Pacific nations regarding climate change were reaffirmed.",
      "She outlined two matters of fundamental importance to the progress of the AGBM.",
      "The first is the urgency of concluding the work of the AGBM by 1997, so that its results can be considered at COP- 3.",
      "The second matter concerns the results of the IPCC\u0092s Second Assessment Report, which clearly indicate the reality of climate change and the necessity and economic feasibility of taking urgent action.",
      "The fact that certain Parties are requesting further analysis has raised concerns that the work of the IPCC and others will be duplicated, and the completion of the Berlin Mandate process will be delayed.",
      "There have, however, been some promising initiatives made in the AGBM process, such as the European Union\u0092s proposal for an outline protocol framework, which was tabled at the last session of the AGBM."
