      "You should not be impelled to act for selfish reasons, nor should you be attached to inaction.",
      "(Bhagavad Gita.",
      "2.47) Marking the culmination of a year of unprecedented high-level political, media and public attention to climate change science and policy, the Bali Climate Change Conference produced a two-year roadmap that provides a vision, an outline destination, and negotiating tracks for all countries to respond to the climate challenge with the urgency that is now fixed in the public mind in the wake of the headline findings of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report.",
      "The outline destination is an effective political response that matches both the IPCC science and the ultimate objective of the Convention; it was never intended that the Bali Conference would focus on precise targets.",
      "Instead, the divergent parties and groups who drive the climate regime process launched a negotiating framework with building blocks that may help to square a number of circles, notably the need to reconcile local and immediate self-interest with the need to pursue action collectively in the common and long-term interests of people and planet.",
      "The informal dialogue over the past two years has now been transformed into a platform for the engagement of parties from the entire development spectrum, including the United States and developing countries.",
      "This brief analysis opens with a discussion on the complexity of the climate change process, and describes the elements of the Bali roadmap and their potential significance in enabling negotiations on the future of the climate regime, including a post-2012 agreement.",
      "It identifies the main political achievements of the Conference, and assesses some of the specific outcomes from negotiations on the so-called building blocks of mitigation, adaptation, financing and technology transfer."
