      "This contact group met in afternoon and evening sessions.",
      "Co-Chair Fadhel Lari introduced the Co- Chairs\u0092 draft conclusions as well as proposals from the EU and G-77/China.",
      "Delegates debated at length which document to use as the basis for discussion.",
      "The G-77/CHINA said its proposal was an initial one, as not all its members had been consulted.",
      "Opposed by the US and EU, it suggested using the proposal as the basis for discussion.",
      "Delegates agreed to proceed on the basis of the Co- Chairs\u0092 draft, and began working paragraph-by-paragraph. There were divergent views over whether to delete reference to 'progress made,' with the G-77/CHINA preferring language indicating that little or no progress has been made in implementing decision 5/CP.7 (adverse effects).",
      "The US and EU suggested stating that progress has been made through multilateral and bilateral activities in the areas of information and methodology, vulnerability and adaptation, as well as in convening workshops and establishing the SCCF and LDC Fund.",
      "On the reports of the workshops on insurance and risk assessment, delegates could not agree on whether to address them in separate paragraphs. Regarding the workshop on economic diversification, delegates discussed how the TOR should be elaborated.",
      "The G-77/CHINA said the process of submissions could delay the organization of the workshop, noting that decision 5/CP.7 calls for it to be held prior to COP-9.",
      "The Co-Chairs proposed compromise text requesting the Secretariat to take into account the views expressed during SB-18 in this regard. Delegates revisited amendments proposed in the earlier session.",
      "The Secretariat prepared a revised draft incorporating the Parties\u0092 proposals.",
      "After a brief consideration of the revised text, the group adjourned.",
      "The Co-Chairs will conduct informal consultations and produce another revision for discussion at the next meeting."
