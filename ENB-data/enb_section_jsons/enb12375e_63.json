      "The main issues discussed under this sub-item were access to funding for preparation of non-Annex I national communications and information on financial support provided by the GEF for the preparation of non-Annex I communications ( FCCC/SBI/2008/INF.3/Rev.1 ).",
      "On access to funding, most developing countries reported difficulties with accessing GEF funding to prepare their national communications.",
      "They also expressed concern about the effect the GEF s Resource Allocation Framework (RAF) has on access, availability, predictability and continuity of funding.",
      "Developing countries said it was unacceptable for the agreed full costs for the preparation of national communications to be met from allocations under the RAF, as this is not mandated by the COP and affects the amount of funding available to developing countries to implement other projects.",
      "On the information provided by the GEF, most parties were in agreement that the information was incomplete."
