      "On Wednesday, 3 November, there was an exchange of views among participants organized around two themes: progress made in dealing with climate change, and promoting implementation of the BAPA and early entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. After COP-5 President Jan Szyszko opened the high-level segment, UNEP Executive Director Klaus T\u00f6pfer said developed countries need to address their consumption and production patterns, stressing that technologies were available to reach the Protocol target.",

FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar said that for there to be successful negotiations based on the BAPA: leading industrial economies should engage in early domestic action; the CDM should be made the cornerstone of a North-South compact at COP-6; the bottlenecks in the delivery and consideration of non- Annex I Parties' national communications should be addressed; a credible regime prohibiting targets from being achieved solely through 'hot air' and 'sinks' must be developed; and the Protocol must enter into force by 2002."
