Switzerland, supported by the Russian Federation, underlined the importance of training review experts and supported holding of a workshop to exchange information about the preparation of third national communications.",
      "The EU said it expected a decision on Protocol Article 7.2 (national communications) at COP-6 and a decision on Protocol Article 8 (review of information) at COP-7.",
      "The US and Canada suggested postponing consideration of the review of guidelines on national communications until SB-14.",
      "With Australia, they stressed the issue was not a priority for COP-6. On Wednesday, 14 June, the SBI adopted the draft conclusions on national communications of Annex I Parties (FCCC/SBI/2000/CRP.5), whereby the SBI, inter alia, welcomes the majority of the reviews that have been done, and requests the Secretariat to organize a workshop in 2001 to exchange information among Annex I Parties on preparations for the third national communications."
