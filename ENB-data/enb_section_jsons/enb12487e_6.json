      "The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, took place from 7-19 December 2009, and included COP 15 and COP/MOP 5, the 31st sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), as well as AWG-KP 10 and AWG-LCA 8.",
      "Over 110 world leaders attended the joint COP and COP/MOP high-level segment from 16-18 December.",
      "The conference was marked by disputes over transparency and process.",
      "During the high-level segment, informal negotiations took place in a group consisting of major economies and representatives of regional and other negotiating groups.",
      "Late in the evening of 18 December, these talks resulted in a political agreement: the Copenhagen Accord, which was then brought to the COP plenary.",
      "Over the next 13 hours, delegates debated the Accord.",
      "Many supported adopting it in the form of a COP decision as a step towards securing a better future agreement.",
      "However, some developing countries opposed the Accord, which they felt had been reached through an untransparent and undemocratic process.",
      "Ultimately, the COP agreed to take note of the Copenhagen Accord.",
      "They also established a process for parties to indicate their support for the Accord and, to date, 140 countries have indicated their support.",
      "More than 80 countries have also provided information on their emission reduction targets and other mitigation actions.",
      "On the last day of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, the COP and COP/MOP also agreed to extend the mandates of the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP, requesting them to present their respective outcomes to COP 16 and COP/MOP 6 in Cancun, Mexico. BONN CLIMATE CHANGE TALKS (APRIL AND JUNE 2010): Negotiations resumed in 2010 with AWG-LCA 9 and AWG-KP 11, which took place from 9-11 April.",

      "The AWG-KP agreed to continue considering Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions, as well as the other issues.",
      "Discussions continued in Bonn from 31 May to 11 June.",
      "AWG-LCA 10 focused on the Chair s new draft text.",
      "Towards the end of the meeting, AWG-LCA Chair Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe) circulated the advance draft of a revised text.",
      "Some developing countries felt that the advance draft was unbalanced and should not be used as the basis for negotiations in August unless their views were reflected more fully.",
      "A revised version of the Chair s draft text was circulated in July. AWG-KP 12 focused on Annex I emission reductions and other issues, including the flexibility mechanisms and LULUCF.",
      "It also addressed ways to avoid a gap between the first and subsequent commitment periods, and requested the Secretariat to prepare a paper on legal options for achieving this. BONN CLIMATE CHANGE TALKS (AUGUST 2010): AWG-LCA 11 considered the Chair s draft text circulated in July 2010 (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/8).",
      "The AWG-KP continued consideration of the scale of Annex I emission reductions under the Protocol and other issues.",
      "It also discussed legal matters, including a possible gap between the Protocol s first commitment period (2008-2012) and subsequent commitment periods.",
      "The AWG-KP agreed to forward a Chair s draft proposal (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/ CRP.2) for further discussion in Tianjin."
