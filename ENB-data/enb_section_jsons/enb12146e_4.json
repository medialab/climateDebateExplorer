      "On 8 September, delegates discussed key areas of contention as identified by the Co-Chairs based on discussions related to the consolidated synthesis of Party submissions on LULUCF.",
      "On separation of natural versus human-induced effects, SWITZERLAND, opposed by CANADA, supported a negotiated threshold to deal with the human- induced effects, which could also be adjusted to deal with issues of uncertainty and permanence. On eligibility of Article 3.4 activities, TUVALU drew attention to the insufficiency of existing data, suggesting it would be difficult to base a sound decision on such data.",
      "On limitation of debits and credits of additional activities, the US supported using a threshold, opposed using a cap, and said a possible phase-in approach should provide incentives to take action.",
      "On aggregation- degradation, AUSTRALIA said the issue was not a priority, and said he could support a process decision at COP-6. On 9 September, Co-Chair Thorgeirsson introduced the new Co-Chairs' text on elements related to Article 3.3 and 3.4 that would be the basis for deliberations during SB-13."
