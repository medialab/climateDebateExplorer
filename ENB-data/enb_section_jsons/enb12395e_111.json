      "For the AWG-KP, the focus was on a strategic discussion of all the key items on its agenda and on the work programme for 2009, with a view to agreeing on further actions required to finalize Annex I countries post-2012 commitments in Copenhagen.",
      "Some observers and developing countries were hoping for a clear decision on the aggregate range of mid-term emission reductions by industrialized countries.",
      "However, while the 25-40% range by 2020 from the AR4 once again appears in the AWG-KP s conclusions, the language is similar to that used in previous conclusions and falls short of a definitive commitment.",
      "According to some negotiators, this was mostly due to the reluctance of some Umbrella Group countries to commit to a mid-term range at this point.",
      "However, many also noted the lack of serious attempts to reach an agreement on this issue in Pozna\u00c5\u0084, possibly because delegates realized the political climate was not yet ripe for such discussions.",
      "Overall, most felt that the outcomes from the AWG-KP were modest, limited to the 2009 work programme and to agreement that Annex I countries further commitments should principally take the form of quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives (QELROs).",
      "Those with lower expectations for the meeting noted that little more than this might have been expected, as parties wait for the bottom of the market downturn and the arrival of the new US administration."
