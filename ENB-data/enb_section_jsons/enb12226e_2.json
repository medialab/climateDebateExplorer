      "This contact group discussed the Co-Chairs\u0092 revised draft conclusions on the consideration of the fifth compilation and synthesis of initial national communications, and on work of the CGE.",
      "Parties discussed whether to qualify how many non-Annex I Parties have submitted projects for funding, with the G-77/CHINA suggesting removing reference to 'many' non-Annex I Parties.",
      "The EU said that since not all non- Annex I Parties have submitted national communications, absence of qualification would be misleading.",
      "Addressing the urgency of submission of initial national communications, delegates discussed whether submissions should be 'invited,' 'urged' or 'encouraged.",
      "' Parties deliberated whether the preparation of national communications has provided a 'valuable opportunity' for capacity building, with the G-77/CHINA urging deletion of this reference.",
      "Opposed by the G-77/CHINA, JAPAN preferred removing reference to 'further' financial and technical support for enhancing national capacities.",
      "Regarding a compilation and synthesis of information from national communications from small island developing States (SIDS) with a focus on adaptation and mitigation, NIUE and ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA, supported by the US, AUSTRALIA, and EU, urged retaining this as a separate synthesis document. Turning to work of the CGE, Parties addressed how workshops should be organized.",
      "The EU, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, suggested that workshops could address all thematic areas in a combined approach, rather than addressing one theme only.",
      "THAILAND stressed that such an approach would not necessarily enhance 'effectiveness and efficiency' of the workshops."
