      "The UNFCCC stipulated that Parties must report on the actions they take or are planning in order to implement the UNFCCC.",
      "Consistent with the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities,' the content and timetable for submitting these reports - or 'national communications' - varies depending on whether the country is an Annex I (developed or economy-in-transition) Party to the Convention or a non-Annex I (developing country) Party.",
      "Non-Annex I Parties have a more flexible timetable for preparing and submitting their national communications.",
      "Most non-Annex I Parties must submit their first national communications within three years of the Convention\u0092s entry into force for that Party, although the least developed countries (LDCs) can make their initial communication 'at their discretion.",
      "' Non-Annex I Parties are also eligible for some financial and technical assistance from the Global Environment Facility (GEF).",
      "In addition, some other donors and agencies have assisted non-Annex I Parties in preparing their national communications. Further work on non-Annex I Parties\u0092 national communications was completed at the Second Conference of the Parties (COP-2), held in Geneva in July 1996.",
      "At COP-2 delegates agreed on the substance that should be contained in national communications, and set out guidelines for such communications (as contained in the Annex to decision 10/CP.2)."
