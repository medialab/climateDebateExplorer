      "In the agreed conclusions at SB-18, Parties\u0092 expressed their support for the World Conference on Climate Change (WCCC), which will be held in Moscow in September, prior to COP-9.",
      "Some observers suggest that support was not, however, as universal as it appears in the text.",
      "Apparently, the EU may make its high-level participation in the WCCC somewhat conditional on the steps Russia takes towards ratification over the next few months.",
      "This direct indication of the importance the EU places on Russia\u0092s ratification will compliment some of the positive signals sent by discussions at SB-18 on IPCC TAR and Articles 5, 7 and 8, and may counteract some of the negative signals.",
      "In any event, while Russia\u0092s ratification will allow the Protocol to enter into force, it will by no means resolve outstanding issues relating to the Protocol\u0092s seaworthiness and the regime\u0092s course.",
      "It seems clear that the regime will soon be tested by the Protocol\u0092s implementation and the review of demonstrable progress, with a dialogue on developing country participation looming on the horizon."
