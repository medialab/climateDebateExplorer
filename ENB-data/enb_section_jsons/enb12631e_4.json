      "Discussions were chaired by ADP Co-Chair Djoghlaf and focused on the Secretariat\u2019s proposals for consolidation.",
      "No objection was made to the merging of options 1 and 2 in paragraph 223 on withdrawal. On the Secretariat\u2019s proposal to combine, in paragraph 215 on signature, ratification approval and accession, sub-paragraphs 3 and 4 on actions by regional economic integration organizations and on groups of parties, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and the EU said the proposal mixes concepts and does not reduce the length of the text.",
      "Parties agreed the two sub-paragraphs will remain separate. On paragraph 216 on entry into force, parties considered merging sub-paragraphs 216.1 and 216.2 into a single sub-paragraph with options on either entry into force by 2020 or potentially before 2020.",
      "Parties agreed to further consider this proposal, as well as a proposal by China on these sub-paragraphs. The above-mentioned paragraphs, except sub-paragraphs 3 and 4 in paragraph 215, were forwarded to the facilitated group."
