      "Tuesday began with jubilant delegates streaming from negotiations that closed the SBSTA agenda item on methodological guidance on REDD+.",
      "Many agreed that work on this issue in Bonn had set a positive precedent for compromise and flexibility.",
      "The celebratory mood, however, did not extend to all SB items, with some despairing that intransigence of a handful of parties on the 2013-2015 review would prevent the inclusion of any substance in draft conclusions. The wave of optimism missed the ADP negotiations on the text of the new agreement, prompting one senior observer to lament that, while last week parties were \u201cspeaking to each other\u201d on procedural issues, when discussing substantive ones, they \u201cretreated to long-held positions.\u201d With only two more days left in Bonn, many doubted whether parties could build on the trust generated by the streamlining exercise, and start addressing \u201cthe real issues on the table.\u201d"
