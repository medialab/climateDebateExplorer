   "sentences": [
      "The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess scientific, technical and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding the risks associated with human-induced climate change, its potential impacts, and options for adaptation and mitigation.",
      "The IPCC does not undertake new research, nor does it monitor climate-related data.",
      "Instead, it conducts assessments of knowledge on the basis of published and peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature.",
      "The IPCC has three WGs: WGI addresses the physical scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change; WGII addresses the vulnerability of socioeconomic and natural systems to climate change, impacts of climate change and adaptation options; and WGIII addresses options for limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigating climate change.",
      "Each WG has two co-chairs and six vice-chairs, except WGIII, which, for the Fifth Assessment cycle, has three co-chairs.",
      "The co-chairs guide the WGs in fulfilling the mandates given to them by the Panel and are assisted in this task by Technical Support Units (TSUs).",
      "The IPCC also has a Task Force on National GHG Inventories (TFI) to oversee the IPCC National GHG Inventories Programme, which aims to: develop and refine an internationally-agreed methodology and software for the calculation and reporting of national GHG emissions and removals; and encourage the use of this methodology by parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",
      "The Panel elects its Bureau for the duration of the preparation of an IPCC assessment report.",
      "The Bureau's role is to assist the IPCC Chair in planning, coordinating and monitoring the IPCC's work.",
      "The Bureau is composed of climate change experts representing all regions.",
      "Currently, the Bureau comprises 31 members: the IPCC Chair and Vice-Chairs, the WG Co-Chairs and Vice-Chairs and the TFI Co-Chairs.",
      "In 2011, the IPCC established an Executive Committee to assist with intersessional work and coordination among the WGs.",
      "The Committee consists of the IPCC Chair, IPCC Vice-Chairs, WGs and TFI Co-Chairs, and advisory members, including the Head of the Secretariat and the four Heads of the TSUs.",
      "The IPCC Secretariat is located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is hosted by the WMO."
