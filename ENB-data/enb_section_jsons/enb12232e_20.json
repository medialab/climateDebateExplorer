      "Participants call for: existing software, tools, methods and models for V&A assessments to be made readily available to non-Annex I Parties by modeling centers and institutions, and the development of a central repository by the UNFCCC Secretariat to disseminate these tools and methods; the level of financial and technical resources for V&A assessments to be commensurate with the specific needs and concerns identified by non-Annex I Parties; the expansion and further elaboration by the UNFCCC Secretariat of the section in the UNFCCC Guidelines on measures to facilitate adequate adaptation, in collaboration with other relevant organizations; consideration to be given to issues relating to Intellectual Property Rights in the development and use of models and tools in V&A assessments, particularly at the local community levels and those that include the use of traditional knowledge; action by the GEF implementing agencies to address and streamline delays in the project approval process for the preparation of LDC NAPAs and the preparation of second national communications; and further clarification on the expected outputs/products of the APF, by the agency responsible for its development, including regarding its potential for synergy with other initiatives and practices, its utility in addressing other impacts identified in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, and its potential for integrating traditional knowledge and practices. The recommendations also note that the APF could contribute to measuring how the adverse effects of climate change will affect sustainable development, and consequently the UN Millennium Development Goals and poverty reduction strategies at national and regional levels.",
      "They call on UNDP and other collaborating organizations to explore the possibilities of replicating the APF in other regions."
