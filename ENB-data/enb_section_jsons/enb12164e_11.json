      "Kadio Ahossane (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) discussed greenhouse gas abatement issues.",
      "He highlighted that his country's forest had diminished from 13 million acres in 1960 to 2.1 million acres in 2000, and indicated the importance of this fact for emissions abatement.",
      "He outlined programmes and measures implemented in the industry, energy, forestry and agriculture sectors aimed at reducing emissions.",
      "He listed a number of identified constraints, including: lack of appropriate knowledge of climate change issues, including national experts; lack of relevant institutions and facilities; lack of appropriate database for studies in this domain; inappropriate emission factors as far as localities are concerned; and lack of available documents related to climate change issues in languages other than English.",
      "He concluded that a number of challenges that influence the preparation of national communications remain, such as the need to: understand and address climate change issues; develop climate change databases; develop country or regional emissions factors; improve the technical approach; maintain and expand national capacity; and raise public awareness and promote the participation of stakeholders."
