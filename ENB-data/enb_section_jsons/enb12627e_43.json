      "Discussions on the AR6 assessment cycle began one and a half years ago, when the Task Group on the Future of the IPCC was first set up.",
      "In Nairobi, the Panel took up the group s recommendations and while future scoping meetings will elaborate the AR6 products in detail, the Panel made foundational decisions.",
      "The Panel decided to maintain the comprehensive assessment reports as the primary products of each cycle, with a number of participants explaining that this what the IPCC does best.",
      "With climate impacts already being felt, many have been asserting that a 5-7 year cycle is too long to enable decision makers to respond in a timely manner, with the science changing at a rapid enough pace to warrant frequent reports.",
      "Others have also argued that such rapid updates are necessary to better inform policy decisions under the UNFCCC.",
      "Many countries called for regional reports as stand-alone IPCC products, highlighting the need for more accessible and region-specific information.",
      "Despite the fact that a decision on this was not accepted, the decision does include regional aspects within the ARs and the possibly of further addressing these issues through SRs.",
      "Delegates remarked that the richness of regional aspects is likely to increase in the AR6 as the Panel also decided to encourage greater use of non-English literature by increasing its accessibility and greater engagement by authors of such literature in the IPCC.",
      "A big concern for the IPCC has been communicating its findings, in an accessible manner, not just to policymakers, but to society at large.",
      "More user-friendly products, particularly through the engagement of communications specialists, including graphic designers, at an early stage and throughout the AR6 drafting period will only help lead to a more responsive and accessible IPCC, thus, making the IPCC findings more compelling and easier for policymakers and others to understand."
