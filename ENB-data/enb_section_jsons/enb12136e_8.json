      "Delegates adopted, without discussion, draft conclusions on: Guidelines under Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol, which included an Annex on Guidelines for National Systems for the Estimation of Anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Sources and Removal by Sinks under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/L.2); Development and Transfer of Technologies - Status of the Consultative Process (Decision 4/CP.4); and Development and Transfer of Technologies - Other Matters (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/L.4). After some deliberation, the Draft Conclusions on Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/L.3) were adopted, with two amendments: Annex I Parties with EITs may phase-in good practice guidance 'two years,' rather than one year, later than other Annex I Parties; and reference to 'all Parties' being assisted by good practice guidance in preparing higher-quality greenhouse gas inventories was deleted. On the Draft Conclusions on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry, SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by a number of Parties, including TUVALU speaking for the G-77/CHINA, proposed deleting text on convening an intersessional consultation on LULUCF after SBSTA-13.",
      "The text was retained and the conclusions were adopted with an Annex providing formats for the submission of country-specific data on proposals by Annex I Parties for activities related to Protocol Article 3.3 (afforestation, reforestation and deforestation) and Article 3.4 (additional activities).",
      "ITALY offered to host the intersessional consultation, suggesting it take place in October."
