      "The eleventh Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 11) and the first Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 1) took place in Montreal, Canada, from 28 November to 10 December 2005.",
      "Parties also met for the twenty-third sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB 23). At COP/MOP 1, parties adopted decisions on the operational details of the Kyoto Protocol, including the package of decisions known as the 'Marrakesh Accords,' and on a process for considering post-2012 commitments.",
      "Parties also adopted the IPCC\u0092s Good Practice Guidance on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) for reporting during the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012).",
      "COP 11 addressed issues such as capacity building, technology development and transfer, the adverse effects of climate change on developing and least developed countries, and a process for considering future action beyond 2012 under the UNFCCC.",
      "In its decision on long-term cooperative action to address climate change by enhancing implementation of the UNFCCC, the COP resolved to engage in a non-binding dialogue that would be informed by the IPCC.",
      "Parties also agreed to a five-year work programme for the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, and requested that SBSTA, at its twenty-eighth session, consider additional activities based on new information, including that presented in the AR4. SBSTA 23 considered the IPCC\u0092s Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage and, inter alia, requested the UNFCCC Secretariat to organize an in-session workshop at SB 24 on carbon dioxide capture and storage, and encouraged parties and the private sector to support research and deployment of such technologies.",
      "In relation to harvested wood products, SBSTA noted with appreciation the IPCC report on progress made in estimating and reporting harvested wood products in the context of preparing its 2006 Guidelines, and decided to continue consideration of this issue at SBSTA 24."
