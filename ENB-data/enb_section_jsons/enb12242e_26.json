      "In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.5), SBSTA agrees to next steps in implementing decision 13/CP.7, recalling that steps should: facilitate cooperation among Annex I Parties by sharing experiences and exchanging information at the technical level; involve all Parties and, as appropriate, environmental and business NGOs, and include the exchange of information on policies and measures undertaken by Annex I Parties in all relevant sectors; and contribute to the improvement of transparency, effectiveness, and comparability of policies and measures.",
      "SBSTA also notes that these steps should take into account considerations such as environmental effectiveness, cost- effectiveness, social and economic impacts and ancillary benefits.",
      "In addition, SBSTA invites Annex I Parties to make available information on their experiences in implementing policies and measures to all Parties at a technical roundtable discussion at SBSTA-22.",
      "SBSTA also requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to provide information on options for using, inter alia, Internet-based approaches to sharing experiences and exchanging information on 'good practices' in policies and measures."
