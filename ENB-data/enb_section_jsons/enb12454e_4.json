      "COP/MOP President Hedegaard noted ongoing consultations on how to proceed with the proposed Protocol amendments. TUVALU urged that the issue must not be swept under the carpet and stressed that the legal context under this agenda item is based on Protocol Article 20 (amendments) and is therefore different from the work by the AWG-KP under Protocol Article 3.9 (Annex I further commitments).",
      "TUVALU stressed that their aim was not to merge the Kyoto Protocol with a new instrument but to preserve the legal architecture including the Protocol.",
      "Calling for substantive discussions, he said it would be grave injustice to forward the issue to another COP/MOP.",
