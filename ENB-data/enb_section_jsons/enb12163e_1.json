      "Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to the sustainability of the world's environment, human health and well-being, and the global economy.",
      "Mainstream scientists agree that the Earth's climate is being affected by the build-up of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, caused by human activities.",
      "Despite some lingering uncertainties, a majority of scientists believe that precautionary and prompt action is necessary. The international response to climate change took shape with the development of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",
      "Adopted in 1992, the UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that would prevent anthropogenic (human-induced) actions from leading to 'dangerous interference' with the climate system.",
      "The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, 90 days after the receipt of the 50th ratification.",
      "To date, it has received 185 instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession from States.",
      "Since it entered into force, six meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP) have taken place, as well as numerous workshops and meetings of the UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies - the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)."
