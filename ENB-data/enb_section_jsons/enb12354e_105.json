   "sentences": [
      "This agenda item (FCCC/CP/2007/4 and Add.1) was first taken up by COP on Monday, 3 December.",
      "A contact group and informal negotiations were facilitated by Howard Bamsey (Australia) and Sandea De Wet (South Africa).",
      "During the high-level segment, negotiations also took place at the ministerial level.",
      "The outcome of the negotiations on long-term cooperative action formed a centerpiece of the Bali roadmap, and required extensive negotiation.",
      "A decision to establish an ad hoc working group was adopted at the final COP plenary.",
      "Negotiations focused on both the nature of the process moving forward, and on the four building blocks identified as crucial aspects for the roadmap: adaptation, mitigation, technology transfer, and financing.",
      "During these negotiations, the most controversial issues included questions about the nature of the process moving forward; preambular text on mitigation referencing the IPCC's finding that Annex I parties as a group would need to cut emissions in a range of 25-40% by 2020; and an operative paragraph that addressed the nature of commitments or actions by different parties.",
      "On the nature of the process, Japan proposed that the COP adopt a decision on the formation of a new ad hoc working group under the Convention.",
      "China called for parallel but independent processes under the Convention and the Protocol.",
      "The US supported a two-track approach and the formation of a working group.",
      "Co-Facilitator Bamsey presented three options for a new process: an informal Convention process similar to the previous Dialogue approach; a formal Convention process taking the form of a new subsidiary body under the Convention (an ad hoc working group); or an integrated, formal process combining work under the Convention (again, through an ad hoc working group) with work under the existing AWG under the Kyoto Protocol.",
      "After an exchange of views on this matter, it became clear that the second option, formalizing the UNFCCC process under an AWG while keeping the Convention and Protocol work under separate tracks was the most acceptable option for most parties.",
      "Thus, the COP decision created an ad hoc working group on long term cooperative action.",
      "The second major issue was text in the preambular section referencing the IPCC's range of 25-40% cuts to Annex I parties \u0092 emissions by 2020.",
      "This reference was contained in a draft decision non-paper distributed the co-facilitators on 8 December, and was the subject of debate over the subsequent seven days.",
      "While the EU and developing countries favored this text, the US, Canada, Japan and the Russian Federation argued that it was overly-prescriptive and was attempting to prejudge the outcome of the process.",
      "After lengthy debates, language that referred to IPCC's reference to this in the AR4 report of Working Group III was included in the final text.",
      "Finally, text on mitigation caused ongoing debates that were only resolved in the closing plenary on 15 December.",
      "While the US, Canada and others sought stronger language on developing country action/commitments, the G-77/China opposed this, and instead sought to place the focus on language dealing with Annex I commitments.",
      "In spite of reported progress during small-group consultations held on Friday night, this issue was still unresolved when the COP convened at 8:30 am on 15 December.",
      "President Witoelar presented a Proposal by the President (FCCC/CP/2007/L.7) in an effort to engineer a compromise.",
      "India drew the President's attention to his country's preference for a paragraph on nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country parties in the context of sustainable development, supported by technology and enabled by finance and capacity building in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner.",
      "The plenary was subsequently suspended and further informal consultations were held.",
      "When the plenary reconvened on Saturday afternoon, the EU and several developing countries said they could support India's proposal, while t he US stated that she could not accept this formulation.",
      "Responding to US comments, South Africa noted that a paragraph on developing country mitigation goes further than what was expected in the Convention, while the paragraph on developed country commitments was not as strong as he would have liked.",
      "Papua New Guinea asked the US to get out of the way if it was not willing to lead.",
      "The US responded that, after listening closely to the interventions, she was heartened by the expressions of commitment by developing countries and major emerging economies.",
      "She said the US wanted to go forward as part of a new framework and to be part of the roadmap.",
      "Therefore, she agreed to join the consensus on the matter.",
      "With this final issue resolved, the text was adopted."
