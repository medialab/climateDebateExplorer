      "The forum will reconvene on Wednesday. APPEALS AGAINST CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD DECISIONS (SBI): During afternoon informal consultations on appeals against decisions of the CDM Executive Board, parties considered draft text on the procedures, mechanisms and institutional arrangements for appeals against CDM Executive Board decisions.",

      "Several parties underscored that the focus of the group s work, as mandated by the COP/MOP, is on a procedure for appeals against decisions to reject project registration or CER issuance requests.",
      "Some parties noted that certain projects are registered automatically, as reviews are only undertaken if requested by three members of the Executive Board or a party involved in the proposed project.",
      "They said that in such cases, it might be appropriate to allow appeals against CDM Executive Board decisions to approve such project registration requests.",
      "One party highlighted that if parties decide to allow appeals against CDM Executive Board decisions to approve projects, this decision should not apply retrospectively, but should only apply to new projects approved after the appeals procedure has been established.",

      "Parties then discussed the LDC Fund (LDCF) and also considered the type of guidance that the GEF would require.",
      "One party observed that Decision 5/CP.16 (further guidance for the operation of the LDCF), requesting the GEF to support the ongoing implementation of NAPAs to facilitate the implementation of the remaining elements of the LDC work programme, was too vague.",
      "Parties agreed to invite the GEF to the next meeting to clarify the type of guidance that would be required from the group."
