      "The approved answer states that natural, technical and social sciences can provide essential information and evidence needed for decision-making on what constitutes 'dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.",
      "' At the same time, such decisions are value judgments determined through socio-political processes, taking into account considerations such as development, equity, and sustainability, as well as uncertainties and risk.",
      "The answer also states that the basis for determining what constitutes 'dangerous anthropogenic interference' will vary among regions and depends upon mitigative capacity, since the magnitude and the rate of change are both important.",
      "It also notes that the TAR assesses available information on the timing, opportunities, costs, benefits, and impacts of various mitigation and adaptation options."
