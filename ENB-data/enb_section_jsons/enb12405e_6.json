      "During informal consultations, parties addressed the Co-Chairs non-paper and agreed that it provided a good basis for further work.",
      "In the contact group, the Co-Chairs explained that the draft conclusions on LULUCF were postponed, pending discussions on legal matters.",
      "They noted that the draft conclusions could be expected to be short and include a call for submissions and an invitation to provide relevant data. BRAZIL suggested that the data invited from parties address two things: the impact of proposed accounting methods for forest management (such as the bar approach) on potential numbers, given that existing historical data may not be relevant to the forecast nature of the exercise; and how factoring out anthropogenic from non-anthropogenic effects would be addressed. TUVALU pointed to three elements from his submission that were improperly reflected in the Co-Chairs non-paper, clarifying that: forest biomass decline was not meant as an alternative to forest management; the concept of force majeure was missing an element; and the proposal was for net-net accounting for forest management and other elected activities starting at the beginning of the commitment period.",
      "He also clarified that his proposal for accounting for harvested wood products was meant as a package that would allow the fast tree fix and other such anomalies in decision 16/CMP.1 to disappear."
