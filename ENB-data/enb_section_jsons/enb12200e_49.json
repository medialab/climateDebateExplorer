      "The agenda item on Annex I national communications was considered by the SBI Plenary on Monday, 10 June, and draft conclusions were adopted on Friday, 14 June. On Monday, the Secretariat drew attention to a document (FCCC/SBI/2002/3) that details greenhouse gas emissions trends for Annex I Parties and suggests options for improving the process of reviewing and considering national communications. Observing that emissions trends left 'no grounds for complacency,' the EU proposed that the review process be considered at SB-17.",
      "Canada, the US and Australia stated that the current process works well, and opposed any modifications at this time. Chair Estrada highlighted the status report on the review of third national communications (FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.4). On Friday, 14 June, Chair Estrada presented the draft conclusions, proposing deletion of 'according to available data' in paragraph one.",
      "The draft conclusions were adopted without further amendment."
