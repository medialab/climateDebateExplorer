      "The real world political and economic global order as we enter the 21st century is more complex than it was when climate change arrived on the political agenda -- a fact that raises all kinds of contradictions in the structure of the FCCC, not least the question of who really belongs in Annex I and Annex II and the distribution of responsibility.",
      "Weighed against that observation is the fact that debts to history -- notably the history of North- South relations and that of industrial GHG emissions-- survive much longer than contemporary economic trends. While climate change is undoubtedly an environmental issue -- the paramount issues at the AGBM are increasingly exposed as questions concerning the concealed political and economic costs of the industrialized world\u0092s free ride to unsustainable development.",
      "Whether Berlin Mandate negotiators will produce what one observer called 'an impossible mass' to resolve at Kyoto, or the critical mass to address an objective to which all Parties have already committed, must become clearer with the passing of the seasons."
