      "In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.8), the SBSTA notes: the importance of organizing methodological work in an effective and efficient manner; the need to prioritize its methodological work; and the importance of reliable information.",
      "The SBSTA requests the Secretariat to prepare a paper taking stock of the availability, accessibility and comparability of existing sources of emissions data and relevant socioeconomic data, and to develop options for the development, hosting and management of a data interface, for consideration at SBSTA-19. The SBSTA also decides to continue considering proposals by Parties on provisional elements of a possible future work programme at SBSTA-19, and invites further submissions. Regarding information provided by the IPCC on the planned revision of its 1996 inventory guidelines, the SBSTA invites the IPCC to report on the progress of this work at SBSTA-19, and possibly at future sessions."
