      "In informal consultations, parties began working on the basis of the Chair s text (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/CRP.4).",
      "Some parties called for a decision so that LULUCF does not become a reason for a gap between commitment periods.",
      "On Friday, 3 December , parties considered a co-facilitators non-paper, which provided two options for a LULUCF decision.",
      "Some parties lamented that their proposals were not adequately reflected in the text.",
      "On Saturday, 4 December, parties discussed a new co-facilitators non-paper.",
      "Parties considered which version of the co-facilitators non-paper should be used: one that integrates all parties proposals, or another one that keeps two distinct options.",
      "Parties eventually agreed to move forward based on the Saturday non-paper.",
      "Over the two weeks, parties undertook informal informal consultations on harvested wood products (HWPs) and force majeure.",
      "They discussed three options for accounting for HWPs, as follows: instant oxidation; the application of a single decay rate; and more detailed product specific decay rates.",
      "On force majeure , parties noted discussion on clarifying anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic disturbances, as well as the need for clarity on links between causes and impacts of disturbances.",
      "Parties also discussed whether, in the event of force majeure , all emissions from the disturbance would be excluded or only emissions above a threshold.",
      "Parties raised concerns about lack of clarity on whether force majeure refers only to a single event or to an accumulation of events.",
      "Parties also considered the need for clarification of wetland accounting.",
      "Some parties preferred a narrow definition for wetland management, focusing on anthropogenic rewetting and draining.",
      "On options for forest management, parties discussed reference levels, baselines, net-net accounting and a cap.",
      "A party proposed, and many opposed, deleting the option for a cap.",
      "Parties also considered the review process for reference levels.",
      "The AWG-KP subsequently agreed on draft conclusions (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/L.8) containing a draft COP/MOP decision (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/L.8/Add.2), which the COP/MOP adopted on 10 December."
