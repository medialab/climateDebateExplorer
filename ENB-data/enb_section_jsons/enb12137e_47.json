      "Similarly in the debate on mechanisms, an agreement on text from which negotiations will proceed signified a useful, businesslike approach.",
      "Controversy still remains, especially with regard to the possible inclusion of sinks- related projects in the CDM, an issue that became more visible with the release of the new IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry.",
      "Most Latin American countries favor the inclusion of sinks-related projects in the CDM.",
      "In fact, some countries already have AIJ projects on sinks that they would like to see converted to CDM projects in order to acquire Certified Emission Reductions.",
      "The EU and some developing countries oppose the inclusion of sinks in the CDM, citing the huge uncertainties in sinks projects, the difficulty in ensuring permanence, and the tremendous potential for leakage. The IPCC report does not provide answers to these concerns, but does provide a scientific basis for further work.",
      "This will be a key issue to watch at COP-6, given the deep differences between the EU and the US, and between the Latin American countries and AOSIS.",
      "To date, most African countries, India and China appear to be non-committal, and are observing how the issue unfolds before deciding on their game plans."
