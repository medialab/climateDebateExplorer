      "This agenda item was taken up by the Panel in the plenary on Monday and then addressed by the financial task team on Wednesday, co-chaired by Conchita Martinez (Spain) and Ismail Elgizouli (Sudan).",
      "In the plenary on Monday, Chair Pachauri noted his concern with several countries financial contributions not being provided in a timely manner.",
      "On Wednesday night in plenary, Secretary Christ asked for further guidance from the Panel on the development of the budget (IPCC-XXXI/Doc.2), which addresses the next three years and also includes the indicative budget for the full assessment cycle up to 2013.",
      "She said the contingency in this year s budget has completely been used and suggested increasing the budget to add 10 trips in 2010 for the cross-working group meeting on uncertainty and risks.",
      "Following discussions in the financial task team, Co-Chair Martinez presented the revised budget to the Panel (IPCC-XXXI/Doc.2/Rev.1), highlighting the proposal from Mali for providing travel funds to developing country/EIT government representatives to accompany Bureau members and the issue of a budget for a TSU for the SYR from June 2010, which would add 100,000 Swiss Francs.",
      "She also noted their efforts to stabilize the budgets and the need for additional funds for 2008-2009.",
      "The Netherlands expressed concern over the growing gap between income and expenditure, given the current financial crisis and the difficulty governments have in raising funds and asked if there were plans for targeted fundraising.",
      "Chair Pachauri acknowledged that they have approached governments and are hopeful of generous support in response.",
      "The UK suggested merging the 33rd and 34th sessions of the IPCC to reduce costs.",
      "Secretary Christ said two sessions are needed as the financial year will not be closed by IPCC-33, but that the Panel meetings could be held back-to-back with approval sessions for the Special Report on renewable energy and the Special Report on extreme events to save costs.",
      "Austria noted that this would result in two week-long meetings in 2011, to which Pachauri replied that this was easier and more cost-effective than the alternative.",
      "Norway announced that they will sponsor both the Special Report on extreme events second lead author meetings in March 2010 in Hanoi, Vietnam, and government/expert review meeting in January 2011 in Bangkok, Thailand.",
      "They also announced their special contribution of 350,000 Swiss Francs to the IPCC Trust Fund.",
      "The budget was then adopted by the Panel."
