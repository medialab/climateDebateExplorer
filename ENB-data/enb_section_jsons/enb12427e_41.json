   "sentences": [
      "In the middle of the northern summer, almost 2,400 participants gathered in Bonn for intersessional informal consultations of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the UNFCCC (AWG-LCA) and the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP).",
      "This impressive turnout of so many climate experts willing to sacrifice their holidays was a clear indication that time is running out.",
      "Delegates were reminded of this fact at the close of the session on Friday, 14 August, when the clock on the podium of the main plenary hall revealed that the beginning of the Copenhagen conference was 114 days, 15 hours and 55 minutes away.",
      "Only six weeks earlier, many of the same delegates had left Bonn with heavy suitcases, carrying the nearly 200-page long negotiating text developed during AWG-LCA 6, as well as the various non-papers resulting from AWG-KP 8.",
      "Upon their return to Bonn, they faced what most characterized as a considerable challenge : to make the texts more manageable and workable so that good old fashioned negotiations can actually begin.",
      "From the outset, expectations on political movement at this informal session, known as Bonn III, were modest: the vast majority agreed with AWG-LCA Chair Michael Zammit Cutajar that the session was best seen as the first part of a three-week phase extending through the next meeting in Bangkok in late September.",
      "Given the session s informal nature, the two AWGs were not even mandated to adopt conclusions.",
      "It was, therefore, clear that Bonn III was not a meeting where major breakthroughs would happen, despite, what some characterized as positive political signals taken during the intersessional period in other fora, such as the G-8 and the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change (MEF).",
      "Still, by providing parties with an opportunity to start streamlining the negotiating text, Bonn III played an important role on the road to Copenhagen.",
      "Given the range of complex issues on the table, as well as the magnitude of the AWG-LCA s negotiating text, such opportunities to focus on drafting and technical details are necessary to reach an agreement in Copenhagen.",
      "This brief analysis focuses on process and progress under both AWGs at Bonn III, and concludes with a look ahead on the road to Copenhagen through Bangkok and Barcelona."
