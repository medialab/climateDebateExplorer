      "In the conclusions on LULUCF (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.26), SBSTA takes note of the information contained in the document relating to LULUCF projects under Protocol Article 6 (joint implementation).",
      "On HWP, SBSTA takes note, inter alia, of the IPCC\u0092s work on developing methods to estimate, measure, and report on HWP in the context of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and the intent of the IPCC to develop, for the purpose of compiling greenhouse gas inventories under the UNFCCC, methods that are neutral in relation to potential accounting approaches for HWP.",
      "SBSTA also invites the IPCC to report, on a regular basis, on progress made on this issue. SBSTA also decides to continue the consideration of various impacts of country-level data on production, use, and disposal of HWP at SBSTA-23.",
      "SBSTA invites Parties that have not done so to provide available data and information on changes in stocks and emissions of greenhouse gases from HWP and to submit updated information on HWP and experiences of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines and GPG to the Secretariat by 1 August 2005.",
      "SBSTA requests the Secretariat to compile these submissions, and information on HWP contained in previous submissions from Parties specifically on HWP, and in national greenhouse gas inventory reports, for consideration at SBSTA-23.",
      "SBSTA also agrees to continue deliberation on items relating to factoring out at a future session, noting that a decision on biome-specific definitions is not needed at this stage."
