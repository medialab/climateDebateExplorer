      "This agenda item (FCCC/SBI/2008/11, 15, MISCs.5-6, FCCC/CP/2008/2 and FCCC/TP/2008/5) was first considered by the SBI in plenary on 2 December, and subsequently in informal consultations facilitated by Crispin D Auvergne (Saint Lucia) and Helmut Hojesky (Austria).",
      "During consultations, disagreements persisted on language relating to support provided by the GEF in the implementation of the capacity building framework, and the use of performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation.",
      "The G-77/China preferred language expressing disappointment with implementation of the framework and particularly the support provided by the GEF.",
      "Most developed countries opposed this, stating that no review had been carried out and such language was inappropriate.",
      "In addition, the G-77/China supported the development of performance indicators for monitoring and evaluating capacity building, which developed countries opposed as unnecessary.",
      "Parties finally agreed on compromise language and SBI conclusions were adopted on 10 December.",
      "A COP decision, which was agreed at SBI 28, was adopted by the COP on 12 December."
