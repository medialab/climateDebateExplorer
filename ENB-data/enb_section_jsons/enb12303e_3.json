      "Discussion took place on language on membership of the governing body, the share of proceeds and other funding and, particularly, on eligibility criteria.",
      "On eligibility criteria, BRAZIL proposed adding language that references developing country parties and regions prone to severe weather events and language from Convention Article 4.8 on countries with forested areas and forest decay to a list of parties to be given priority by the Fund.",
      "SOUTH AFRICA and COLOMBIA said a list was not needed since the general language proposed on eligibility is consistent with Article 12.8 of the Kyoto Protocol (Clean Development Mechanism).",
      "MICRONESIA noted the need to be consistent with the language agreed to in Article 12.8.",
