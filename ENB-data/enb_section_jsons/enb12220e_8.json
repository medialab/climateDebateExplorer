      "David Cooper, CBD, provided examples of the CBD\u0092s cooperation with other conventions, including: the establishment of joint work programmes with the CCD and the Ramsar Convention; cooperation on work programmes with the FAO; and formal recognition of the role of other agreements, including the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and the International Plant Protection Convention.",
      "He identified three categories of common interests where synergies could be possible: biodiversity-linked measures to mitigate climate change; adaptation measures to mitigate impacts of climate change on biodiversity; and climate change adaptation measures.",
      "Cooper noted that CBD COP-5 urged the UNFCCC to take all actions to reduce effects of climate change on coral bleaching, called on CBD Parties to explore how incentive measures under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol can support CBD objectives; and requested SBSTTA to provide scientific advice to integrate biodiversity considerations into the implementation of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.",
      "He concluded that: there are significant opportunities for climate change mitigation and adaptation, while enhancing biodiversity conservation; land use, land-use change and forestry activities can play an important role in reducing net greenhouse gas emissions; and that biodiversity conservation and maintenance of ecosystem structure and function can contribute to adaptation strategies."
