      "Thomas Rutherford, Associate Professor, Department of Economics of the University of Colorado, highlighted how disaggregation of data affects results and presented a model showing impacts of response measures by Annex I countries on Saudi Arabia.",
      "He noted that, when oil exporting countries are considered individually, the adverse impacts appear greater than when the countries are clustered within regions.",
      "He said impacts of response measures are heterogeneous across non-Annex I countries, and more developing country specific data is needed.",
      "On response measures, he observed that replacing the existing mix of taxes with a targeted carbon tax could decrease costs both to Annex I countries and oil exporters.",
      "He also recommended action focusing on diversification and a move to greater production of non- energy goods in countries dependent on oil exports."
