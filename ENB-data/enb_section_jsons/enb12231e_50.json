      "In its decision on the consideration of the fifth compilation and synthesis of initial national communications (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.23), the COP concludes, inter alia, that: many non-Annex I Parties have submitted projects for funding; the enhancement of capacity and support is necessary for the maintenance of capacity built during the preparation of national communications; and there continues to be a need for financial and technical support to enhance national capacities in non-Annex I Parties to prepare second and, where appropriate, third national communications.",
      "The COP requests the Secretariat to prepare a compilation and synthesis of information contained in initial national communications submitted up to 1 April 2005, and a document on possible means to facilitate the implementation of projects proposed for funding by non-Annex I Parties."
