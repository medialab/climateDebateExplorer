      "Dr. Helmut Kohl, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, urged delegates to remember the lessons of Berlin, noting that never again must 'walls of enmity' be erected between peoples, nations and States.",
      "He stated that the Rio Conference provided a clear signal of hope, but the recent recession shows that sustainable development does not sufficiently determine the actions of States.",
      "He stressed three central issues: industrialized country responsibility to limit CO2<D> emissions permanently beyond the year 2000; a negotiation mandate from this Conference for a noticeable reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions after 2000; and agreement on joint implementation to facilitate the transfer of know-how and technology."
