      "Outlining her consultations during AWG-LCA 14 in Tianjin, AWG-LCA Chair Mukahanana-Sangarwe highlighted a shared desire for a balanced and comprehensive outcome that: respects the two-track approach; balances elements of the BAP; reflects a balance on the level of detail; and does not prejudge a future legally-binding outcome.",
      "She highlighted her new note on the possible elements of an outcome (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/CRP.1) reflecting the current state of progress, indicating that not all elements are fully elaborated.",
      "Mukahanana-Sangarwe explained that the elements were presented in the search for common ground, have no formal status and will not replace the official negotiating text (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/14), which contains the comprehensive spectrum of parties views.",

      "Some called for consideration of a peak year.",
      "Some parties objected to references to historical responsibility and atmospheric space.",
      "Parties also discussed the extent to which the text should include what will be achieved and how it will be achieved.",
      "On the AWG-LCA Chair s note released on Sunday, 5 December (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/CRP.2), some developing and developed countries noted missing elements, including: short and long-term goals; sustainable development; inclusion of a review; and language on a legally-binding outcome.",

      "Parties discussed, inter alia, the nature and level of developed country mitigation, as well as the method of inscription.",
      "On the nature of mitigation, parties had expressed differing opinions regarding whether this should be in the form of targets or commitments.",
      "Regarding inscription, some parties preferred inscribing information on targets in an annex to a decision, while others suggested that without a legally-binding agreement, an annex provides insufficient certainty.",
      "Parties also held divergent views on launching a process to clarify individual mitigation pledges and/or defining an overall level of ambition of Annex I parties mitigation efforts.",
      "In addition, some parties highlighted the need to address the issue of comparability of actions or commitments, both among developed countries and between developed and developing countries.",

      "Parties identified key elements for inclusion in the text: a general framework; agriculture; and international aviation and maritime transport.",
      "Many parties opposed proposals to include hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) as a key element, saying this issue is not within the mandate of the group and does not constitute a specific sector.",
      "Eventually, parties agreed to: to leave HFCs for possible consideration in the future; use the facilitator s note as a basis for further work; and bring in content from the Tianjin text on the general framework.",
      "Parties addressed the general framework and key elements for consideration, including: reference to Convention Article 4.1(c) (technology transfer); the usefulness of taking a sectoral approach; a reference to the principles of the Convention; and the voluntary nature of sectoral approaches.",
      "Divergent views remained on the latter two elements, with developing countries supporting inclusion of a reference to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.",
      "Some developed countries disagreed with the consideration of this principle in the context of bunker fuels, but one developing country noted that the International Civil Aviation Organization has already recognized differences among countries.",

      "Parties were not able to agree on this issue.",
      "Sub-paragraph 1(b)(v) of the BAP (various approaches, including opportunities for using markets to enhance the cost-effectiveness of, and to promote, mitigation actions): Parties considered this in a drafting group facilitated by Tosi Mpanu Mpanu (Democratic Republic of the Congo).",

      "During the drafting group meetings, parties first considered whether to proceed on the basis of a new text or on the text forwarded from Tianjin.",
      "A number of developed country parties supported using the new text while many developing countries preferred the Tianjin text.",
      "Parties agreed to give the facilitator the mandate to streamline the Tianjin text, with the understanding that it be based on discussions on what elements have to be included in the text and be brought back to the group before being forwarded to ministers for further consideration.",
      "Several parties highlighted essential elements for the text, including: a mandate to establish a work programme or programmes on new market mechanisms, as well as on non-market mechanisms and other approaches; that discussion of market mechanisms should not start prior to ratification of a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol; recognition that parties may use market mechanisms to meet mitigation commitments; voluntary participation in mechanisms; and safeguarding environmental integrity.",

      "Many parties requested clarification on the proposal s elements, including on: the nature of contributions; whether the mechanism should be under the guidance of the SBI or the SBSTA; the process to further define the mechanism s elements; the role of the private sector; linkages with existing risk management systems; and ensuring inclusiveness.",
      "Many parties said the mechanism should be under the COP s authority.",
      "Some parties described the proposal as immature, while others explained that once the main decision on the establishment of the mechanism is made, further details on key elements should be established through a country-driven process.",
      "Many parties proposed that the mechanism should be one component within a range of adaptation tools.",
      "During the second week, two areas of contention emerged among developing countries: which countries are most vulnerable and inclusion of response measures in the adaptation text.",

      "One developing country suggested that, in addition to LDCs, SIDS and Africa, developing countries with areas prone to droughts, floods and desertification with fragile ecosystems, and facing increased frequency of extreme and catastrophic events and trends linked to climate change should be included as priority recipients.",
      "On long-term finance, developing countries supported the option that developed countries should contribute 1.5% of their GDP to support developing countries, rather than text referring to a US$100 billion annual commitment by 2020.",
      "Many developed countries expressed reservations on text indicating that the main or major source of funding will be assessed or indicative contributions from Annex II parties to the Convention.",

      "Capacity building: During discussions, parties considered whether capacity building should be supported and enabled as a stand-alone activity or delivered as an integrated component of mitigation and adaptation efforts.",
      "During consideration of a revised draft, many developing country parties supported retaining the option to establish a technical panel on capacity building in a legally-binding instrument, while many developed countries supported an option affirming that existing institutional arrangements or proposed ones include capacity building in their mandate.",
      "On references to operating entities of the financial mechanism and reference to the proposed new fund, one party said these could prejudge other parallel negotiations.",
      "Different views also remained on text concerning developed country reporting of support provided for capacity building in developing countries, and developing country reporting of progress in enhancing capacity to address climate change, including on the use of the support received.",
