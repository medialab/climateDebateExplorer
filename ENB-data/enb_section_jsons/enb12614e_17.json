   "sentences": [
      "On Saturday, parties concluded the first reading of the draft decision on advancing the ADP.",
      "In the morning and afternoon, parties addressed paragraphs on guiding enhanced action on, and future work of, workstream 2 (pre-2020 ambition) and basis for dynamic high-level engagement.",
      "The EU, supported by the US and SWITZERLAND, stressed that the focus of workstream 2 should remain on mitigation.",
      "Many developing countries emphasized the need to also address adaptation and MOI.",
      "CHINA, with JORDAN, suggested focus on how to increase international support to enhance action.",
      "AUSTRALIA called for recognizing support to developing countries from various sources.",
      "Many parties described the technical expert meetings (TEMs) as useful and supported their continuation.",
      "Nauru, for AOSIS, emphasized improving and extending TEMs until the mitigation ambition gap is closed, and indicated their outputs should include: updated technical papers; a dynamic online 'menu' of policy options; focus on co-benefits of actions, barriers to implementation and strategies to overcome them; and a synthesis for policy makers.",
      "With JORDAN, EL SALVADOR and CHINA, he said TEMs should focus on mitigation and adaption opportunities.",
      "NORWAY, with SWITZERLAND, supported TEMs' focus on mitigation, including fossil fuel subsidy reform, and, with COLOMBIA, called for recognizing the work of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. JAPAN, supported by NEW ZEALAND, suggested strengthening linkages with existing institutions, including the technology transfer information clearinghouse TT:CLEAR and the CTCN.",
      "NORWAY emphasized the role of the TEC and CTCN in organizing TEMs.",
      "EL SALVADOR suggested closer links with the Adaptation Committee and Adaption Fund. INDIA, SAUDI ARABIA and ARGENTINA called for technical papers.",
      "Mali, for the AFRICAN GROUP, suggested work leading to a technical synthesis and a summary for policy makers to inform ministerials. AOSIS called for the TEMs' review no sooner than 2017, with a view to their improvement.",
      "CANADA supported review 'at some point'.",
      "SWITZERLAND favored a review in 2016 or 2017. BOLIVIA, INDIA and others proposed increasing the scope of TEM topics, with BOLIVIA suggesting a focus on technology knowledge systems and practices of indigenous peoples and local communities.",
      "Colombia, for AILAC, called for engagement of indigenous peoples and academic institutions.",
      "Many parties welcomed high-level engagement on the ADP.",
      "AOSIS, with CHINA, Bangladesh, for the LDCs, and AILAC, called for annual high-level engagement.",
      "BRAZIL said ministerials should be held sparingly, when concrete policies can be proposed to them, and, with AOSIS and the EU, agreed to work on improving TEMs' output.",
      "The US called for annual ministerials on pre-2020 ambition in conjunction with the COP.",
      "BRAZIL, BOLIVIA, PAKISTAN and INDIA opposed contributions from sub-national authorities to high-level events.",
      "On engagement of a broad range of actors for effective implementation of enhanced action, SWITZERLAND said engagement with non-state actors should take place at the national level.",
      "TANZANIA, supported by MEXICO, suggested that subnational entities and local authorities act through their national governments.",
      "Opposed by the EU and the US, MEXICO, with BANGLADESH, supported conducting, and offered to host, regional and sub-regional TEMs, with BRAZIL willing to explore this idea.",
      "Citing financial implications, SWITZERLAND said such TEMs should be held back-to-back with other meetings.",
      "The LDCs called for support to enable technical experts from developing countries to participate in TEMs. BRAZIL, supported by AUSTRALIA, the US and SWITZERLAND, suggested noting health co-benefits of mitigation policies.",
      "The US proposed adding also economic co-benefits.",
      "EGYPT proposed co-benefits 'in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication'.",
      "On the annex (complementary information on INDCs), PANAMA requested that the role of forests be recognized and called for reference to considerations on bioenergy.",
      "ARGENTINA, with EGYPT, expressed concern over the inclusion of land sector emissions, noting that agriculture is not the main contributor to climate change.",
      "Tuvalu, for the LDCs, proposed differentiated reporting for countries with economy-wide emission reduction targets and developing countries, emphasizing means of support.",
      "On preambular paragraphs, the LDCs, opposed by the EU, requested deletion of reference to the global average temperature increase of 2 \u00b0C.",
      "Many developing countries, opposed by the US, supported references to the principles and provisions of the Convention.",
      "The US did not see annex-based differentiation as a path to the new agreement and, with JAPAN, opposed 'bifurcated language'. CHINA, with PAKISTAN and ARGENTINA, requested references to the BAP and, with Algeria, for the ARAB GROUP, and others, to previous COP decisions.",
      "CHILE called for reference to intergenerational equity.",
      "The US, with JAPAN, favored recognizing that contributions are nationally determined and reflect national circumstances.",
      "The MARSHALL ISLANDS, with the EU and CHILE, preferred 'pledges' to 'contributions'. JORDAN, INDIA, CHINA and VENEZUELA opposed reference to the catalyzing role of sub-national authorities in enhancing the impact of implementation of policies on reducing emissions and vulnerability, and building resilience. SAUDI ARABIA proposed acknowledging, in line with the IPCC SYR, that effective adaptation and mitigation responses will depend on policies and measures across multiple scales.",
      "Transparency of Action and Support: BRAZIL said transparency cannot substitute accountability, and is linked not only to mitigation, but also adaptation and MOI.",
      "He called for a transparency framework that reflects differentiation and is built on existing MRV arrangements under the Convention. TURKEY opposed, calling for a common framework with common MRV provisions applicable to all parties, with flexibility for developing countries on the level and depth of the application of the common MRV provisions.",
      "ECUADOR requested a reference to CBDR.",

      "Indicating flexibility on period length, SWITZERLAND, with NORWAY, emphasized that all parties should communicate their commitments at the same time.",
      "TURKEY preferred a 10-year period with a mid-term review.",
      "On ex ante consideration, AILAC called for a robust process.",
      "SWITZERLAND urged ex ante consideration of aggregate commitments.",
      "TURKEY said the process should not be prescriptive.",

      "TURKEY and Tuvalu, for the LDCs, said contributions could be revised on a voluntary basis.",
      "The LDCs called for two annexes for: quantified emission reduction commitments; and emission limitation commitments and strategies.",
      "AUSTRALIA said parties should be allowed to adjust their commitment/contribution on an exceptional basis.",
      "On strategic review of implementation, AILAC supported a five-year cycle and, with SWITZERLAND, TURKEY and the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, and opposed by CHINA, said it should be applicable to all parties.",
      "NORWAY said review should harness unrealized opportunities.",
      "Informal Stocktaking Meeting: COP 20/CMP 10 President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal described the first week as one of 'proposals, explanations and clarifications', and called for the second week to be one of 'dialogue, flexibility and construction' in order to deliver, by Thursday evening, 'the outcome the world is expecting from us'. ADP Co-Chair Kumarsingh proposed, and parties agreed, that the Co-Chairs make available, by Monday morning, improved versions of the non-paper on elements and of the draft decision on advancing the ADP, based on input received from parties during the first week.",
      "Parties queried whether the revised versions of the documents would entail a compilation of inputs or not, with Co-Chair Kumarsingh assuring parties that they would.",
      "Several delegates called for prioritizing discussion on substance 'to speed up progress towards agreement and enhance clarity' on the scope of, and information required for, INDCs.",
      "Suggestions by parties on the way forward included holding separate discussions on CBDR and equity, and 'taking ownership' by moving on from the 'Co-Chairs' non-paper' to a more formal text."
