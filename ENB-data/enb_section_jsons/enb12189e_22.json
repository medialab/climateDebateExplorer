      "Delegates met from 30 October - 6 November in a negotiating group co-chaired by Ra\u00fal Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) and Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia).",
      "The group met to consider key political and technical issues outstanding from the Bonn Agreements relating to Article 6 (joint implementation), Article 12 (CDM), Article 17 (emissions trading), and Article 7.4 (assigned amounts).",
      "The crunch issues that cut across modalities and rules for the mechanisms and Article 7.4 included: the linkages between compliance and mechanisms' eligibility; inventory reporting and mechanisms' eligibility; fungibility and banking of units; and Principles on sinks and the CDM.",
      "The negotiating group relied on a Co-Chairs' non-paper on issues relating to the procedures of the mechanisms, followed by a new draft text integrating mechanisms with regional groups' positions on Article 7.4.",
      "From 7-10 November, extensive high-level bilateral and multilateral negotiations were held to broker a deal on these outstanding issues, which remained unresolved until early Saturday morning, 10 November, when a final 'package deal' on mechanisms was agreed."
