      "The word 'catalyze' can have different meanings in plain English and in chemistry.",
      "In chemistry, the catalyst remains unchanged as it speeds reactions.",
      "The catalyst in real life is transformed in the process of catalyzing by, if nothing else, the experience of its actions.",
      "The IPCC now possesses 18 years of experience working with scientists and policy-makers from many countries.",
      "It would be a shame to lose the expertise that has been built by the IPCC, and that might have been the case if the IPCC delegated the entire process for scenario development to the scientific community to organize itself.",
      "Instead, the IPCC will remain engaged in seeing that the desired features and characteristics of scenarios are incorporated and that these are ready for a fifth assessment report. Had the IPCC washed its hands of any involvement beyond assessment, it is unlikely that many developing country experts would have been included in the process.",
      "Instead, the travel funding for 50 scientists from developing countries and economies in transition will ensure their participation at the new emission scenarios meeting in 2007.",
      "In this regard, the discussion on flooded lands under the 2006 Guidelines provides an example of how important it is to include the views of different scientists from different regions in any global analysis.",
      "Applying the same approach to disparate regions may lead to bias in the results.",
      "Addressing these differences in an open forum results in products that can be both scientifically credible and politically approved for widespread use. The accumulated experience of the IPCC has resulted in a unique organization that, although it has downsides, can provide valuable advice on addressing the concerns of all countries or regions.",
      "While its success is due in large part to a focused and limited mandate, it would be unfortunate to not take full advantage of its future potential and its past record of success. Fortunately, the decision at IPCC-25 on emission scenarios does not restrict the role of IPCC but offers the opportunity to capitalize on its unique qualities.",
      "This, together with the acceptance of universal applicability of the 2006 Guidelines, demonstrates the belief of most that the IPCC, given its inclusive nature, has an important role to play.",
      "This broad support is crucial when addressing a global problem such as climate change, the specific consequences of which are unpredictable but will surely be felt by everyone everywhere."
