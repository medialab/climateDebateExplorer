      "On LULUCF, NORWAY said SBSTA-10 can make progress on policy and procedural issues and guide IPCC with its preparation of a Special Report on LULUCF.",
      "AUSTRALIA called for focus on key policy and procedural issues relevant to the negotiating process, and for clarification of the Protocol\u0092s reference to establishing 1990 carbon stock levels.",
      "The EU called for clear definitions of terms and for work on the eligibility of additional activities between now and COP-6. NEW ZEALAND urged SBSTA to adopt a long term approach and further consider treatment of harvested wood products.",
      "The US stressed making timely decisions on LULUCF.",
      "NIGERIA said the Special Report should include definitions of baselines for carbon stocks in sinks and should ensure that policy options are consistent with other convention requirements.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA, SWITZERLAND, GREENPEACE and others expressed reservations about the proposed timing for deliberation on some issues, noting the relevance of the Special Report. On emissions resulting from fuel used for international transportation, the Secretariat reported that the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is currently considering a study on emissions from ships to develop an internationally accepted policy document.",
      "The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) presented an overview of technology and standards, operational measures and market-based options aimed at providing a technical and policy basis for decisions to limit bunker emissions.",
      "SWITZERLAND stressed the need to introduce more stringent regulations, improve air traffic management nationally and internationally and use economic instruments such as eliminating tax privileges on aviation fuel.",
      "SAUDI ARABIA said the use of market-based mechanisms would burden developing countries. On reporting of bunker emissions, the EU proposed that any decision on their inclusion in national inventories should be applied in the second commitment period.",
      "The US preferred treating bunker emissions separately from national inventories, which the EU said results in no direct incentives to limit or reduce bunker emissions.",
      "The REPUBLIC OF KOREA called for further clarification in defining international bunker fuels. On allocation of bunker emissions, AUSTRALIA highlighted the need to establish a policy framework and adopt the most suitable method of recording emissions.",
      "Stating that this is a complicated process, JAPAN called on ICAO and IMO to provide necessary information to help identify possible solutions.",
      "The EU said it would be practical to include bunker fuel emissions in inventories of Parties where the fuel is sold.",
      "Chair Chow proposed drafting conclusions on this matter. Regarding information on impacts, adaptation and mitigation assessment methods, UNEP reported on its recent work on methodologies, including provision of guidance for national strategy development and capacity building on GHG abatement.",
      "TANZANIA suggested establishing FCCC collaborating centers in developing countries for information purposes and capacity building.",
      "UGANDA supported regional capacity building and South- South sharing of expertise. On other matters, BRAZIL reported on a recent workshop held to consider its proposal on determining responsibility based on historical emissions.",
      "He noted that the proposal will be on SBSTA- 11\u0092s agenda.",
      "The IPCC reported on the status of the forthcoming Special Report on Methodological and Technological Issues in Technology Transfer that will present a broad conceptual framework on the complex way technology transfer occurs and reflect the role of governments and other stakeholders."
