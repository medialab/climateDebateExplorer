      "The song My Favorite Waste of Time was proposed as the most apt description of SB 26 during a contest organized by environmental NGOs at the meeting.",
      "Indeed, at a time when the IPCC, the media and the public are sending remarkably clear messages on the need for urgent action against climate change, it seems only reasonable to wonder why delegates chose to spend two weeks fixated on things such as the ways of monetizing the share of CDM proceeds to be channeled to the Adaptation Fund (which is not even operational), or the terms of reference for a constituted body for technology transfer (that does not exist).",
      "And why, some were asking, hold numerous workshops rather than spend the time in negotiations that are clearly needed to respond to climate change and achieve an effective post-2012 agreement?",
      "In fact, seasoned negotiators did discern a method behind the madness in Bonn.",
      "As this analysis shows, SB 26 contributed to the process first by clearing many of the routine issues from the table, and secondly by providing space and clarifying the focus of the post-2012 discussions in preparation for the critical meetings of COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 to be held in Bali in December.",
      "This analysis examines the role of the Bonn meeting in the overall UNFCCC negotiation process, assesses the contribution of SB 26 to the post-2012 discussions, and concludes by looking ahead to Bali."
