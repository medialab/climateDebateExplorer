      "The week-long informal meetings ended with a number of participants expressing concern over slow progress on most issues, given the limited time for COP-6 preparation. The informal week also witnessed the formation of a new negotiating group, the 'Environmental Integrity Group,' which includes Switzerland, the Republic of Korea and Mexico.",
      "The aim of the group is to ensure that its members can participate in smaller group negotiations likely to take place during critical eleventh hour talks at COP-6.",
      "Observers are taking a 'wait and see' approach regarding the possible impact of the new grouping. This news coincided with Vanuatu's announcement that the LDCs will take group positions on issues such as FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects).",
      "Some suggest that this reflects the predictable divergence of interests and priorities among sub-groups within the G-77/China, readily apparent during the informals."
