      "The fact that the IPCC had been requested to prepare a technical paper for a convention other than the UNFCCC was considered to indicate the success of the IPCC, and also to provide a challenge for the IPCC.",
      "While requests from the UNFCCC to carry out work were supported, some delegates noted that such requests from other bodies should only be met if the focus of the work remained on climate change, although there was general agreement that there are distinct inter-linkages between the various environmental conventions.",
      "Several delegates stressed the importance of setting overall priorities.",
      "One participant said the IPCC should decide on its own priorities with regard to which links to focus on, and not depend on requests from other bodies.",
      "Many countries noted that synergies and complementarities need to be explored further, but recognized that funds are an issue.",
      "Delegates also expressed concern that any joint work with another convention or body should be done with the understanding that the IPCC follow its agreed rules. One participant stressed that work requested by other bodies should be carefully defined, and that the effort should be joint and involve both bodies.",
      "Another participant recalled that IPCC efforts rely on voluntary contributions and suggested that scientists will be fatigued if there are too many requests."
