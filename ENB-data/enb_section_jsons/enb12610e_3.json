      "ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger outlined sections of text on finance in document ADP.2014.11.NonPaper, suggesting focus on general aspects first.",
      "Sudan, for the AFRICAN GROUP, with Ecuador, for the LMDCs, and Bolivia, for the G-77/CHINA, opposed text suggesting 'all' parties mobilize climate finance through a diversity of actions.",
      "The AFRICAN GROUP recalled differentiation between developed and developing countries under the Convention, and the responsibility of developed countries to provide finance.",
      "The LMDCs called for deleting references to provision of finance by 'parties in a position to do so' and results-based adaptation finance.",
      "MEXICO clarified 'results-based' is not a precondition for access to finance, and stressed prioritizing both mitigation and adaptation finance. SWITZERLAND suggested including in the 2015 agreement: reference to 'each party' rather than 'all parties' mobilizing climate finance; some text on the purpose of financial resources; and applicable principles, such as being results-based, recognizing developing countries' investment, and reflecting evolving capabilities and responsibilities.",
      "He opposed basing parties' mobilization and provision of financial resources on an ex ante process to commit quantified support commensurate with the effort reflected in the adaptation and mitigation goals.",
      "The US called for including text: encouraging parties to build effective enabling environments; calling for elimination of public incentives for high-carbon investment; and recognizing that climate finance flows in all directions.",
      "He suggested deleting reference to mobilization of climate finance 'as a means to stay below the long-term temperature limit', and, opposed by the AFRICAN GROUP, to 'adequate and predictable' funding for adaptation.",
      "Discussions will continue.",
      "Adaptation: In the afternoon session on adaptation, ADP Co-Chair Kumarsingh invited parties' views on the updated non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text (ADP.2014.11.NonPaper).",
      "The US, MEXICO, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, NORWAY, CANADA, SWITZERLAND, the EU, ZAMBIA, JAPAN and others provided comments on, inter alia : long-term and global aspects of adaptation; commitments and contributions; monitoring and evaluation; sharing information, knowledge and lessons learned; and institutional arrangements. SAUDI ARABIA stressed the need to address differentiation before advancing on elements.",
      "SWITZERLAND said there is no need for differentiation on adaptation, noting that commitments are intended to facilitate preparation for adaptation actions without being burdensome.",
      "ZAMBIA said differentiation needs to be reflected. TUVALU cautioned against referring to 'contributions' or 'commitments'.",
      "The US proposed referring to 'actions'.",
      "BRAZIL said work that has been done under the Cancun Adaptation Framework and NWP should be recognized. MEXICO said interlinkages between adaptation and mitigation, renewed and reinforced collective commitments, national commitments, and adaptation finance should be reflected in the 'protocol'.",
      "She said monitoring and evaluation, and, with NORWAY, institutional arrangements should be addressed in COP decisions.",
      "Emphasizing that adaptation cannot be measured and quantified, CANADA did not support linkages between the long-term temperature limit, the need for support and adaptation.",
      "The REPUBLIC OF KOREA supported a global goal that is general enough to be applicable to all and specific enough to inspire action on the ground.",
      "NORWAY requested that an option for no global adaptation goal be reflected.",
      "JAPAN expressed doubt over a quantitative goal on adaptation.",
      "The US, NORWAY, CANADA and the EU supported broadening the scope of national adaptation planning processes.",
      "The US, CANADA, JAPAN and others saw no need for new institutional arrangements for adaptation.",
      "SWITZERLAND opposed singling out loss and damage in the new agreement.",
      "Informal consultations coordinated by Peru will be held."
