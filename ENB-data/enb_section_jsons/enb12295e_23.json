      "The policy for admitting observer organizations adopted by the Panel provides that, inter alia: organizations that already have obtained observer status in the WMO, UNEP or the UNFCCC are not required to submit additional documentation and are considered observers of the IPCC, subject to acceptance by the Panel, if they so request; observer organizations need to be non-profit and/or tax- exempt organizations; and observer status does not imply admission or invitation to workshops, expert meetings or other closed meetings. The process for admitting observer organizations adopted by the Panel provides that, inter alia: groups interested in observer status should post a letter of application with copies of: documents describing the mandate of the organization; evidence of non-profit and/or tax-exempt status; other information supporting the organization\u0092s competence in matters related to the IPCC; information on the affiliation with other non-government organizations or institutions involved in climate change activities; and contact information; a body is admitted as an observer organization by the Panel by consensus; no funding will be available for observer organizations; and an organization\u0092s status as an observer can be suspended by the IPCC Chair, pending ratification by the Panel at its next session."
