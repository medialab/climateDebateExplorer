      "On equilibrium climate sensitivity, several delegations, including Australia, the Netherlands and others, noted that the message that the lower limit of the assessed 'likely' range of climate sensitivity is less than the 2 \u00b0C in the AR4 can be confusing to policy makers and suggested noting it is the same as in previous assessments.",
      "The CLAs explained that comparison to each of the previous IPCC assessments would be difficult, and new language was developed adding that the upper limit of the assessed range is the same as in AR4.",
      "On GHG metrics, the text was endorsed by Austria, the Netherlands, Slovenia and New Zealand, and opposed by Brazil, who called for informal consultations, explaining this was one of the most important issues in AR5 for his delegation due to different policy implications of the choice between Global Warming Potential and Global Temperature Potential as a metric.",
      "A revised text was developed by an informal group and accepted approved by the WG."
