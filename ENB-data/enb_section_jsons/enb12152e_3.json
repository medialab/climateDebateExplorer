      "This work schedule was outlined in a document called the Buenos Aires Plan of Action.",
      "The critical deadline under the Plan of Action is COP-6, which marks the culmination of this process. At COP-6, delegates will attempt to reach agreement on a package of issues related to the Protocol and the UNFCCC.",
      "Critical Protocol-related issues needing resolution include rules relating to the mechanisms, a regime for monitoring countries' compliance with their commitments, and accounting methods for national emissions and emissions reductions.",
