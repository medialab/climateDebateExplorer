      "This question addressed the evidence for, and causes and consequences of, changes in the Earth's climate since the pre- industrial era. Views differed over whether to include additional proposed text highlighting differences between satellite and surface temperature measurements.",
      "Chair Watson formed a contact group to consider the issue.",
      "Delegates eventually agreed to the Chair's proposal to include a sentence stating that temperature changes have not been uniform globally, but have varied over regions and different parts of the lower atmosphere. Delegates also debated proposed amendments to the sentence 'there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.",
      "' Chair Watson guarded against altering this 'take home message' from the Working Group I SPM, and the sentence was approved without change. Other issues debated by participants included the list of observed changes to climate and biophysical systems in the 20th century."
