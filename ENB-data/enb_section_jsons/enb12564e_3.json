      "After the roundtable, the ADP held informal consultations in the morning and evening on the AOSIS proposal, and on revised draft text by the ADP co-chairs, which seeks to reflect the interventions and submissions made by parties in 2012.",
      "Several parties said the co-chairs text could be strengthened and noted the loss of detail concerning future work and themes, calling for references to issues including: international cooperative initiatives; raising pledges; Annex I countries leadership obligation; adaptation, means of implementation and broad elements of the Bali Action Plan.",
      "Many parties supported requesting submissions from parties on various themes.",
      "However, while not ruling out thematic discussions, some parties expressed discomfort with a sector approach to raising ambition.",
      "Informal consultations continued late into the evening."
