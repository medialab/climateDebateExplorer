      "On 11 December 1990, the 45th session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC/FCCC).",
      "Supported by UNEP and WMO, the mandate of the INC/FCCC was to prepare an effective framework convention on climate change.",
      "The INC held five sessions between February 1991 and May 1992.",
      "During these meetings, participants from over 150 States discussed the contentious issues of binding commitments, targets and timetables for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, financial mechanisms, technology transfer, and 'common but differentiated' responsibilities of developed and developing countries.",
      "The INC sought to achieve a consensus that could be supported by a broad majority, rather than drafting a treaty that dealt with specific policies that might limit participation."
