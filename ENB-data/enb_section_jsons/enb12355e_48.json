      "Wim Monna, the Netherlands, presented the following recommendations: reinforce the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report workshop recommendation to define an authoritative set of data and information needs for adaptation; encourage governments to commit to the adoption of a minimum network, specifically for adaptation; ensure that climate system data and observation is linked with socioeconomic information; involve stakeholders at municipal and state levels, and across sectors, including the private sector, to ensure ownership at the local levels; incorporate local and indigenous knowledge, and knowledge from local forecasters; raise awareness among policy makers of the benefits of strengthening data and observations; include in national communications to the UNFCCC a national inventory of meteorological services activities and needs for adaptation; encourage the use of the Open Source Initiative for access to free software and cost-effective equipment; encourage recovery of data; encourage regions/parties with regional action plans to implement them and the GCOS Implementation Plan; develop regionally-agreed proposals that can be used to increase chances of accessing funding for supporting individual developing countries; and emphasize that better observations have been requested by the UNFCCC."
