      "Participants in WG-I responded to these questions by underscoring the overlap between technology transfer efforts under the UNFCCC and other MEAs and recommending increased communication among technology transfer bodies across various MEAs.",
      "They also suggested further investigating the linkages between WTO rules on trade regimes and technology transfer under the UNFCCC. WG-II suggested, inter alia: increasing cooperation between the secretariats of MEAs to identify synergies and avoid overlaps and duplication of effort; minimizing potential conflict between international agreements, including the WTO and UNFCCC; enhancing dialogue and maximizing synergies between relevant MEAs and organizations; and providing a forum for discussion and international understanding of the interactions between environment and socioeconomic issues."
