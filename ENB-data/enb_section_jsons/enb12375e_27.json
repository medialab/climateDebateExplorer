      "These topics were considered during the roundtable, and a contact group and informal consultations on other issues chaired by AWG-KP Chair Dovland from 4-12 June.",
      "The AWG-KP s closing plenary adopted conclusions on 12 June ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/L.6 ).",
      "On greenhouse gases, sectors and source categories, work centered around broadening their coverage.",
      "Canada and others stressed that the implications of adding a new gas must be explored before its addition.",
      "New Zealand suggested that links to ozone depletion be considered.",
      "The EU supported adding new gases, especially ones with GWPs listed in AR4.",
      "On sectors and source categories, discussions focused on emissions from aviation and maritime bunker fuels.",
      "Parties discussed possible actions under the UNFCCC, International Maritime Organization (IMO), and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).",
      "Argentina, the EU, Norway and others supported controlling maritime and aviation emissions under the UNFCCC, while Singapore and other preferred addressing them through the IMO and ICAO.",
      "The EU stressed significant growth in these emissions and their importance to mitigating climate change.",
      "Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar argued against addressing emissions from aviation and maritime bunker fuels, with Saudi Arabia stating that Article 2.2 of the Protocol would have to be amended before discussion on this issue could take place.",
      "Tuvalu suggested considering financial instruments on aviation and bunker fuels as a source of revenue to fund REDD.",
      "Although the annex was designed to contain all ideas raised by parties, strong insistence by some parties led to the bracketing of this section in the final annex.",
      "Onsectoral approaches, several delegates identified the need for a common understanding.",
      "The EU outlined three meanings: bottom-up approaches as an analytical tool to set national targets; cooperative sectoral targets in developing countries without crediting; and sectoral crediting and trading.",
      "The G-77/China stressed that sectoral approaches should not replace Annex I parties national targets, with New Zealand, Japan and others accepting that they should be complementary.",
      "Controversies emerged, however, between the EU and China and others over the mandate of the AWG-KP to consider sectoral approaches.",
      "Delegates eventually agreed to indicate that sectoral approaches could be used by Annex I parties as a means to reach, but not replace, their emission reduction targets.",
      "In the annex, they also indicate that sectoral approaches within the mandate of the AWG-KP should not , inter alia, lead to commitments for non-Annex I parties."
