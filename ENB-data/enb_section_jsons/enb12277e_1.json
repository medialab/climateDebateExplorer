      "On the proposal of the NGGIP Task Force to hold a follow-up meeting on Emission Estimation of Aerosols Relevant to Climate Change (IPCC-XXIV/Doc.",
      "9), WG I Co-Chair Solomon noted concerns, including: avoiding overlap with the work of WG I; ensuring that the NGGIP works within its mandate and that of the IPCC; and insufficient scientific knowledge for developing methodologies on aerosols.",
      "NEW ZEALAND, with AUSTRIA and HUNGARY, and opposed by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, said the IPCC should defer consideration of further work on aerosols until the AR4 is completed.",
      "CHINA said aerosols should not be included in emission inventories without better scientific knowledge.",
      "The UK, with ARGENTINA and the US, suggested that the IPCC should 'have a story' on aerosols, even if that story is the postponement of further work until after the AR4. NGGIP Task Force Co-Chair Hiraishi said the NGGIP Task Force did not intend to include aerosols in the 2006 Guidelines, or to prepare a research programme on aerosols, rather, it wished to consider how its expertise could assist others with research.",
      "He noted that, given uncertainties about further work, the NGGIP Task Force proposal could be postponed.",
      "Delegates agreed to postpone consideration of further work until after the AR4 is completed."
