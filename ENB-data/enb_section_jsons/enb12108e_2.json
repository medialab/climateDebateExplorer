      "Delegates continued consideration of the synthesis of proposals on the clean development mechanism (CDM).",
      "On further work on CDM, the G-77/CHINA stressed addressing principles and basic elements that are currently not featured in the synthesis report.",
      "The US identified convergence on, inter alia, the need for work on baselines and share of proceeds, and the EU highlighted monitoring, verification, certification and validation. The G-77/CHINA underscored the significance of capacity building.",
      "Supported by PERU, he said capacity building should be incorporated into all CDM projects to enhance endogenous expertise to identify technology needs and capacities for assimilation of technology.",
      "He urged attention to the special needs of LDCs.",
      "The PHILIPPINES stressed that capacity-building initiatives should be country-driven and within the intergovernmental process.",
      "CHINA said capacity building should be 'of, for and in' the developing country.",
      "The AFRICA GROUP underscored the importance of an integrated approach to capacity building and called for guidance from the subsidiary bodies to UN agencies working on such activities.",
      "The EU suggested coordinating the various capacity-building initiatives so as to optimize resource use. PERU highlighted the usefulness of regional discussions on CDM.",
      "SENEGAL suggested involving the financial sector, sensitizing the public and decision-makers and training developing country officials.",
      "SWITZERLAND noted the bottom-up approach suggested by the G-77/China and advocated tailor-made approaches for each country.",
      "VENEZUELA stressed the need to establish clear rules for transparency regarding the project\u0092s contribution to sustainability and the costs, risks and liabilities in the developing country. Chair Chow invited delegates to identify areas of convergence and divergence in views submitted on Protocol Article 6 (joint implementation) activities to assist in redrafting the synthesis of proposals.",
      "On the structure, purpose and principles, the G-77/CHINA noted its submission on elements that should be addressed to enable the COP/MOP to elaborate guidelines.",
      "CHINA suggested focusing on cluster issues, including: principles, purpose, nature and scope; methodological issues; and institutional issues.",
      "The EU suggested including appendices on technical issues such as baselines and monitoring.",
      "SWITZERLAND inquired about a date for early crediting noting the lack of clarity in the case of joint implementation (JI).",
      "The EU said there is no provision for it in the Protocol.",
      "JAPAN noted areas of convergence in the proposals submitted on environmental and cost effectiveness, equity and transparency.",
      "The US emphasized that JI differs from CDM, as it does not share the goal of promoting sustainable development. On Parties participating in JI, the EU said they should have ratified the Protocol and be bound by a compliance regime.",
      "On the involvement of legal entities, she noted the impact they may have on a Party\u0092s responsibilities under Protocol Article 3 (QELROs).",
      "JAPAN stated that the term 'operational entities' was unique to CDM and could not be used when discussing JI.",
      "The EU preferred referring to 'independent entities.",
      "' Regarding project eligibility, the EU identified convergence on a two-step approach in JI; validation before implementation and certification of emissions reductions, and in elements relating to assessment of additionality.",
      "She noted, however, diverging views on the methodology for determining baselines.",
      "JAPAN preferred addressing initiation of JI projects along with project eligibility and said many countries did not concur with the two-step approach.",
      "The US underlined the need to ensure environmental additionality of JI projects. Concerning project monitoring, the EU said participants should provide information on their provisions for systematic, accurate and periodic monitoring and submit the necessary monitoring data to show that the project has resulted in quantifiable and long- term reductions. On the definition of emission reduction units (ERUs), the US noted convergence on how to denominate, serialize and track ERUs, and reiterated the need to recognize that procedures used elsewhere may not be appropriate for constructing JI.",
      "The US also said the registry was an important element for ensuring accurate reporting and tracking, as well as to ensure compliance. On the relationship to the AIJ pilot phase, the US, supported by the EU, said that AIJ activities might be eligible for JI if they fulfill the rules and requirements set for such projects.",

      "He said environmental integrity must be inherent in the system, which should not freeze or perpetuate existing inequities between Annex B and developing countries.",
      "He stressed that the Protocol had not created any right, title or entitlement and said emissions trading should be restricted to excess limitations and reductions additional to a country\u0092s commitment.",
      "The PHILIPPINES distinguished emissions trading from other mechanisms and stressed that it did not imply a right to pollute but an obligation to reduce greenhouse gases.",
      "The EU identified divergence on interchangeability between CERs and ERUs, and, with JAPAN, noted convergence on cost effectiveness, environmental benefits, equity and transparency.",
      "With the G-77/CHINA and the US, the EU said the Protocol did not create property rights, and stated that emissions trading was a way of fulfilling obligations under the Protocol.",
      "AOSIS, with the African Group, highlighted the need for adaptation surcharges to be assessed against all the Protocol mechanisms.",
      "The RUSSIAN FEDERATION reminded delegates that the Convention aimed at stabilizing rather than eliminating greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. On the definition of units, CANADA noted divergence on the concept of fungibility among the Protocol mechanisms.",
      "Regarding the sections on competitiveness, market size and structure, relationship to domestic policies, and liability for sales of non-surplus units, the G-77/CHINA said such headings are not neutral and recommended changing them.",
      "CANADA said reference to 'competitiveness' should be changed to 'access to emissions trading.",
      "' On market size and structure, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested either defining or deleting the term 'hot air' in the text.",
      "Regarding levies, the EU noted some divergence regarding liability for sales of non-surplus units.",
      "On capacity building, the US said paragraphs relating to project specific activities are not applicable to emissions trading and should be removed. Chair Chow said he would redraft the documents based on Parties\u0092 comments, and asked for new submissions to be provided by 1 July 1999.",
