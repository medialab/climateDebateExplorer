      "The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, took place from 7-19 December 2009, and included COP 15 and COP/MOP 5, the 31st sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), as well as AWG-KP 10 and AWG-LCA 8.",
      "Over 110 world leaders attended the joint COP and COP/MOP high-level segment from 16-18 December.",
      "The event was marked by disputes over transparency and process.",
      "In particular, differences emerged on whether work should be conducted in a small Friends of the Chair format or open contact groups.",
      "A proposal by the Danish COP Presidency to table two texts reflecting the work done by the AWGs also caused divisions.",
      "Many parties rejected the Danish text, urging that only texts developed in the AWGs by parties should be used.",
      "During the high-level segment, informal negotiations took place in a group consisting of major economies and representatives of regional and other negotiating groups.",
      "Late on Friday evening on 18 December, these talks finally resulted in a political agreement: the Copenhagen Accord.",
      "After the Accord had been agreed by this group, delegates from all parties reconvened for the closing COP plenary.",
      "Over the next 13 hours, they discussed the transparency of the process and debated whether the COP should adopt the Copenhagen Accord.",
      "Many supported its adoption as a COP decision in order to operationalize it as a step towards securing a better future agreement.",
      "However, some developing countries opposed the Accord, which they felt had been reached through an untransparent and undemocratic process.",
      "Ultimately, parties agreed that the COP takes note of the Copenhagen Accord.",
      "Parties also established a process for indicating their support for the Copenhagen Accord.",
      "By 29 July 2010, 137 countries had indicated their support for the Accord.",
      "More than 80 have also provided information on their emissions reduction targets and other mitigation actions, as agreed under the Accord.",
      "On the last day of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, the COP and COP/MOP also agreed to extend the mandates of the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP, requesting them to present their respective outcomes to COP 16 and COP/MOP 6 in Canc\u00fan."
