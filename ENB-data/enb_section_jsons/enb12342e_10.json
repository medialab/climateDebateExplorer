      "The final text says, inter alia : warming of the climate system is unequivocal; eleven out of the last 12 years rank among the warmest in record; sea level is rising; Arctic sea ice has shrunk by 2.7% per decade since 1978; from 1990-2000 precipitation has increased in North and South America, northern Europe, and north and central Asia, but declined in the Sahel, Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia; tropical cyclone activity has increased in the North Atlantic since 1970; many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases; changes in snow, ice and frozen ground have increased the number and size of glacial lakes; effects of regional climate change are difficult to discern due to adaptation and non-climatic drivers; and there are other emerging effects of regional climate change, including in agriculture, forestry, and human health.",
      "The text also includes two figures, one depicting changes in temperature, sea level and Northern Hemisphere snow cover (Figure SPM 1), and another showing changes in physical and biological systems and surface temperature for the period 1970-2004 (Figure SPM 2)."
