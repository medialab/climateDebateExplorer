      "Taha Balafrej, Morocco, suggested a cycle of one COP/MOP each year and one COP every two years.",
      "He said SBs should last one week, questioned the merit of ministerials, and suggested that more authority be given to constituted bodies to make and adopt decisions. Howard Bamsey, Australia, emphasized the value of having a strong Secretariat, accommodating side-events and holding workshops and other informal activities.",
      "He suggested using the Commission on Sustainable Development\u0092s model of alternating assessment- and policy-focused meetings.",
      "Bamsey recommended abolishing the SBs and moving the Secretariat to New York or Geneva to encourage greater intersessional dialogue between diplomatic missions. Tom Jacob, International Climate Change Partnership, questioned whether actors involved in the UNFCCC process are those best suited to play a facilitative role.",
      "He suggested creating space for the constitution of an informal group, composed of governments and other stakeholders, to work with the Secretariat to meet the global climate change challenge."
