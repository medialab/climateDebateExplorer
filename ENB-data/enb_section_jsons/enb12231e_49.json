      "SBI also acknowledges that existing financial and technical resource allocations may be insufficient to fulfill the CGE\u0092s work needs, and invites Annex II Parties to contribute financial resources.",
      "SBI also encourages the CGE to take into account activities of the GEF/UNDP/UNEP\u0092s National Communications Support Programme. In the conclusions on provision of financial and technical support (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.25), SBI invites Parties to continue to submit views on their experiences with the GEF and its implementing agencies in relation to the preparation of national communications, and requests the GEF secretariat to compile this information and make it available to the SBI. In the conclusions on submission of second and, where appropriate, third national communications (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.30), SBI agrees to continue consideration of this matter at SBI-20."
