      "The Bali Conference demonstrated that at certain moments in climate talks, notably when negotiations are taking place in the full gaze of a public and media who are better informed than at any time since the emergence of the climate change agenda, parties come under extreme pressure to face up to the science.",
      "The high-level political attention given to climate change has introduced an unprecedented level of interest and investment of expertise by organizations, not only by research and advocacy organizations, but also by the media.",
      "The number of side events held in parallel to the conference was also unprecedented, and included two full day events during the weekend: the Climate and Development Days, and the Forest Day.",
      "A youth delegate told the COP plenary, You can't negotiate with physics and chemistry.",
      "This, of course, is not entirely true.",
      "Parties do disagree with the science, but their arguments can sometimes change when they are exposed to the critical gaze of global public opinion.",
      "A feature of the Bali Conference was the shift in a number of positions when negotiators left the closed-door ministerials and returned to the plenary sessions, as illustrated by the pressure that came to bear on the US and Canada in the final COP plenary.",
      "Transparency can be a decisive factor.",
      "At COP/MOP 3, the interplay between international climate politics and domestic elections was illustrated by the dramatic win by Kevin Rudd \u0092s Labor Party in Australia.",
      "In 2008, another domestic election may have a dramatic impact on the global climate change regime, whatever the outcome.",
      "The global public gaze that fixed on the COP plenary in Bali will now turn to the US election in November 2008.",
      "In the meantime, parties to the Convention and the Protocol have succeeded in honoring the call for a breakthrough that came from the UN Secretary-General's climate change summit in September.",
      "Bali launched far reaching negotiations with a clear deadline for the conclusion of an agreement on the post-2012 period.",
      "Bali was successful in delivering the expected roadmap and building blocks.",
      "Now it is up to everyone, negotiators, politicians, public opinion and media to play their respective parts - progress in negotiations, take action, keep up the pressure, and maintain vigilance - to make sure the road from Bali doesn't end up in the sea."
