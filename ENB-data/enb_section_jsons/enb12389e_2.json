      "The co-facilitators reported on informal consultations on the flexible mechanisms and LULUCF, including efforts to prepare text for the next AWG-KP session.",
      "On the type of further commitments, South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, supported continuing the current approach but urged defining national targets based on objective criteria rather than political negotiation.",
      "CHINA highlighted the need for continuity and simplicity and, with TUVALU and the EU, supported retaining 1990 as the base year.-\u00afJAPAN stated that further commitments should be expressed in absolute emission levels and that using a single base year gives unfair advantage to certain countries.",

      "The G-77/CHINA proposed that Annex I parties take on at least a 25-40% goal, and INDIA stressed that lifestyle changes could lead to greater reductions."
