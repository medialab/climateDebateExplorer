      "He supported establishing an interagency committee on the climate agenda. The US discussed the current capacity of the IPCC to undertake further methodological work, the structure envisioned by IPCC to accommodate the short- and long-term needs of the Parties, and the expertise required to support work. The US, AUSTRALIA and the EU urged Parties to prioritize observatory systems and highlighted the deteriorating conditions of the systems in use.",
      "The EU and UZBEKISTAN sought GEF resources to assist developing countries and countries with economies in transition in their observational work.",
      "The US, supported by JAPAN and the EU, called for collaboration with ICAO and IMO specifically in studies on bunker emissions. Some Parties, including the MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAUDI ARABIA and the G-77/CHINA, objected to the establishment of an intergovernmental body on economic instruments since this work is currently being done by IPCC Working Group 3, and suggested that UNEP channel its resources and efforts through the IPCC.",
      "UGANDA underscored the absence of climate information on Africa and sought support for meteorological and hydrological services.",
      "IRAN asked if IPCC would address the climatic impact of solar cycles. On Annex I national communications, the EU called for a Secretariat report on the revisions proposed by Parties for consideration at SBSTA-9 and COP-5.",
      "The MARSHALL ISLANDS said stricter adherence to existing guidelines, rather than full- scale revision, may be needed.",
      "The US highlighted the importance of inventories and sought revisions for guidelines on policies and measures, national circumstances and technology transfer.",
      "CANADA cited examples of inconsistencies in national communications stemming from a lack of clarity in the guidelines and said he would make a written submission.",
      "SWITZERLAND said the Secretariat should record the difficulties cited by countries and called for revision of in-depth review projects. On non-Annex I communications, the Chair noted that SBI would consider this item."
