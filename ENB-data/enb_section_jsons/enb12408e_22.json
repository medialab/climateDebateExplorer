      "Ismail Elgizouli (Sudan), Co-Chair of the Steering Committee on New Scenarios, presented the report from the Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium evaluation panel regarding the lowest Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP3-PD ( IPCC-XXX/Doc.18 ), noting that the Panel confirmed its technical soundness and replicability.",
      "Secretary Christ noted that the full report of the evaluation panel ( IPCC-XXX/INF.6 ) is available online.",
      "Discussions in the plenary and contact group meetings focused on whether the IPCC should accept the report and whether there are any additional questions for the evaluation panel.",
      "Delegates also discussed the future role of the IPCC in scenario development.",
      "Many countries stressed that the process of scenario development should not be delayed and that the Panel should play a catalytic role in scenario development through a possible Task Group.",
      "Referring to little time to study the report, China suggested postponing the acceptance of the report until the next session.",
      "Many countries opposed this, noting the urgency of sending a positive signal to the modeling community.",
      "The US and Australia expressed their trust in the professionalism of the evaluation panel.",
      "Germany expressed concern that the report addresses the behavior of the RCP3-PD only up to 2100 and stated an interest in its behavior beyond 2100 to ensure that its key characteristics, particularly peaking and declining and net negative emissions, are kept.",
      "Switzerland proposed a request to the modeling community to ensure comparability of new scenarios with scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES).",
      "As a result of these discussions, the Panel agreed to welcome the report on the lowest RCP and the fact that its robustness has been confirmed and note that there is an urgent need to move forward with scenario development.",
      "The Panel also invited the evaluation panel to provide information on how the lowest RCP is extended beyond 2100.",
      "In the final plenary, China expressed concerns over the lowest RCP and encouraged the modeling community to continue work to address uncertainty and inconsistency.",
      "In addition, the Panel agreed to set up a Task Group to provide interaction with the scientific community on scenario development, co-chaired by WG II Co-Chair Field and WG I Co-Chair Dahe Qin (China).",
      "This Task Group is expected to address, inter alia , the concept paper for an expert meeting on the socioeconomic consequences of low stabilization scenarios ( IPCC-XXX/Doc.15 )."
