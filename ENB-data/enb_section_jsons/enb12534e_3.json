      "The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, took place in December 2009.",
      "The event was marked by disputes over transparency and process.",
      "During the high-level segment, informal negotiations took place in a group consisting of major economies and representatives of regional and other negotiating groups.",
      "Late in the evening of 18 December, these talks resulted in a political agreement: the Copenhagen Accord, which was then presented to the COP plenary for adoption.",
      "Over the next 13 hours, delegates debated the Accord.",
      "Many supported adopting it as a step towards securing a better future agreement.",
      "However, some developing countries opposed the Accord, which they felt had been reached through an untransparent and undemocratic negotiating process.",
      "Ultimately, the COP agreed to take note of the Copenhagen Accord.",
      "It established a process for parties to indicate their support for the Accord and, during 2010, over 140 countries did so.",
      "More than 80 countries also provided information on their national emission reduction targets and other mitigation actions.",
      "On the last day of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, parties also agreed to extend the mandates of the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP, requesting them to present their respective outcomes to COP 16 and COP/MOP 6."
