      "In the ensuing discussion on the working groups, several participants raised elements they wished to have the Chair include in his report of the workshop.",
      "These included the need to: encourage awareness creation; adopt a cautious approach in considering the utility of indicators; consider if subsidies need to correct market imperfections to promote energy efficiency; address the possibility of good practices being offset by other practices; adopt a common and coordinated approach; exercise caution in determining market reform as positive for CO2 reduction; and link activities at different levels of government and the private sector. Workshop Chair Dovland concluded by highlighting the suggestion that the phrase 'best practice' be replaced with the phrase 'good practice,' and the importance of information sharing."
