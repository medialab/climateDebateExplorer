      "Chair Muyungi drew parties attention to questions: information available to identify common elements for measuring progress; how common elements facilitate comparability of mitigation efforts; the role of WRI and OECD; and the next steps.",
      "Marshall Islands, for AOSIS, underlined the importance of comparability to assess developed countries efforts relative to each other and aggregate, and cited a lack of harmonized rules and differences in adoption of single and multi-year carbon budgets as impeding comparability.",
