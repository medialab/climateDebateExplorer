      "Key issues addressed included: the form of the outcome, deepening understanding, designing policies and measures, possible creation of a permanent forum to address potential consequences, and definition of countries most affected by potential consequences.",
      "On form of the decision , New Zealand, supported by the EU, but opposed by the G-77/China, expressed preference for adopting conclusions rather than a decision.",
      "On countries that would be most severely impacted by potential negative consequences, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, Kuwait, Nigeria and others preferred referring to countries identified in Convention Articles 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10, while the EU, Japan and AOSIS preferred referring to the poorest and most vulnerable developing country parties.",
      "On operationalization , South Africa, for the G-77/China, preferred using the Compliance Committee to address implementation of Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects and impacts of responses) and to facilitate compliance under Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures).",
      "No consensus could be reached on this issue and two options remain in the text, the first utilizing national communications and a mechanism for review of potential consequences and the second creating a permanent forum for addressing the issue."
