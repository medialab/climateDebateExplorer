He recommended: improving estimates of the relationship between the carbon price and the impact on non-Annex B countries based on advice from a panel of experts; improving modeling by using observed Annex B carbon prices as a basis for estimating the impact on non-Annex B countries; and converting various Annex B policies into a 'carbon price equivalent."

He illustrated the potential size of ARD activities in Annex I countries and globally under different accounting approaches and based on different options for the definition of a forest.

Participants also discussed a proposal to place government actions to identify and address barriers to technology transfer in a four- element framework focusing on clarity, consistency, transparency and dissemination. In WG-II, participants pointed out the need for, inter alia: greater communication and interaction between key ministries; delineation of the roles of the private and public sectors in both developed and developing countries; economic incentives targeting industries that are not currently participating in international trade; and ensuring that technology transfer initiatives are compatible with national sustainable development agendas.

The text further notes that: it is likely that, worldwide, there is a technical potential of at least about 2,000 Gt CO2 of storage capacity in geological formations; the economic potential of CCS averaged over a range of baseline scenarios would mean that CCS contributes 15 to 55% to the cumulative mitigation effort worldwide until 2100, although uncertainties in these economic potential estimates are significant; and the role of CCS in mitigation portfolios increases and is found to reduce stabilization costs over the course of the century in most scenarios."
