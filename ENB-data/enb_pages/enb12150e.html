      <h2>MECHANISMS</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Parties continued deliberations on the consolidated text, focusing on emissions trading.</p>
      <p>Regarding the draft decision, the EU, JAPAN and NORWAY questioned the need for text in the decision on principles.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA, with BRAZIL, SAMOA and JAMAICA, and opposed by the US and CANADA, said assigned amounts (AAs) were fixed.</p>
      <p>The EU added that FCCC Article 3 (commitments) referred to 'assigned amounts' not 'initial assigned amounts'.</p>
      <p>Chair Chow made a presentation on AAs that addressed, inter alia: the character of an AAs; what could be transferred and acquired; and an AAs' linkage with Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8.</p>
      <p>SAMOA questioned whether parts of AAs (PAAs) could be held by allocated legal entities or only by sovereign states.</p>
      <p>She suggested that the issue of legal entities participating in emissions trading be addressed in the Appendix on domestic systems.</p>
      <p>She added that if legal entities were allowed to participate, the process must be transparent.</p>
      <p>NEW ZEALAND, with the US, said these were Party issues, and noted his support for full transparency.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA added that appropriate safeguards would be built into Articles 5, 7 and 8 and the provisions on registries. On the modalities of operation, the G-77/CHINA, opposed by CANADA, questioned whether Parties could transfer PAAs that remained unused because of factors other than P&amp;Ms, such as economic recession.</p>
      <p>CANADA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA and EU, suggested withdrawing the appendix on elaborating guidelines on national systems relating to AA units and/or PAAs.</p>
      <p>On the share of proceeds, the US proposed that this be addressed by the group on guidelines.</p>
      <p>On registries, the G-77/CHINA noted that this issue could be addressed within each of the Articles on mechanisms.</p>
      <p>COLOMBIA highlighted a policy document submitted by various Latin American Parties aimed at promoting more effective CDM mechanisms.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_2">
      <h2>LULUCF</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The contact group considered draft SBSTA conclusions.</p>
      <p>Delegates questioned the status of the documents noted in the conclusions, and how they would be developed by the Co-Chairs based on input by Parties.</p>
      <p>TUVALU said it would be premature to have conclusions on text that had yet to be discussed by the group. Parties then continued consideration of Eligibility based on the Co-Chairs' text on elements related to Article 3.3 and 3.4.</p>
      <p>Several Parties drew attention to their submissions on the Co-Chairs' text as compiled in the new miscellaneous document.</p>
      <p>On Accounting, SWITZERLAND, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, supported full carbon accounting.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA suggested specific provisions to deal with perverse incentives to deforest and impediments to new forestation activity prior to the first commitment period.</p>
      <p>Regarding text on carbon pools, TUVALU and the EU opposed inclusion of harvested wood products, while NORWAY supported their inclusion but noted that the issue would be discussed at SBSTA-14.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND, with the EU, TUVALU and NORWAY, and opposed by JAPAN, said natural uptake must be separated from human-induced effects.</p>
      <p>The EU highlighted the link between this issue and limited crediting during the first commitment period.</p>
      <p>On limitation of debits and credits, JAPAN said the option of no limitation of credits should be retained.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_3">
      <h2>TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Delegates discussed the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions, noting that limited progress had been made in elaborating the elements for a draft framework to enhance the implementation of FCCC Article 4.5 (technology transfer). The G-77/CHINA sought a reference to its proposal for a draft decision due to be discussed during the second half of SB-13.</p>
      <p>The US, EU and CANADA objected, as they had not yet seen the document.</p>
      <p>MALAYSIA said the reference could be made without a recommendation on how it would be addressed.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China proposal was distributed to the group. Resuming discussions on the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions, the G-77/CHINA proposed deleting a paragraph inviting the SBSTA Chair, with the assistance of the Secretariat, to provide additional reports on the outcome of the regional workshop, noting the limited time at COP-6 for negotiations.</p>
      <p>She questioned the purpose of additional information and its input to the discussions.</p>
      <p>The UK said the workshop would inform negotiators new to the process.</p>
      <p>MALAYSIA noted that the SBSTA Chair had the discretion to decide if and when to organize informal meetings. Co-Chair Cooper requested the US, G-77/China, and EU to consult informally to seek agreement on the outstanding paragraphs of the draft conclusions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4">
      <h2>PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 &amp; 8</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Co-Chair Plume introduced Part IV of the guidelines under Article 8, Review of National Systems, based on submissions from the EU and Australia.</p>
      <p>She noted the conclusions forwarded from the contact group for adoption at the SBSTA plenary, and said they included as addenda four draft decisions for the COP and COP/MOP on Articles 5.1, 5.2, 7 and 8, and draft guidelines under Articles 7 and 8.</p>
      <p>She highlighted the informal consultations to be held in Bonn in October, and invited Parties to submit views on the guidelines under Articles 5.2, 7 and 8 to the Secretariat before 29 September.</p>
      <p>Co- Chair Plume thanked delegates for their work and closed the contact group.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_5">
      <h2>ADVERSE EFFECTS</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Participants met to consider sections of the Co-Chairs' revised text on Protocol Article 3.14 and the impact of response measures under FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9.</p>
      <p>On Article 3.14, SAUDI ARABIA, supported by several other developing countries, said it referred only to actions by Annex I Parties and indicated that it was inappropriate to suggest that non-Annex I Parties had obligations under this Article.</p>
      <p>The US supported references to non-Annex I Parties, as Article 3.14 did not specify whether actions to be considered by the COP/MOP under this Article were exclusively those of Annex I Parties. On the impact of implementation of response measures, JAPAN, supported by the US but opposed by CHINA, stressed that non-Annex II Parties able to support developing countries should be encouraged to do so.</p>
      <p>Text on the process of information analysis was bracketed.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA, KUWAIT and VENEZUELA stressed the importance of technological development relating to fossil fuels for diversification of economies in oil exporting developing countries.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_6">
      <h2>CAPACITY BUILDING</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Economies in Transition (EITs): Delegates met to discuss the draft framework for capacity building in EITs and a proposed draft decision, which had been revised following informal consultations conducted by Slovenia.</p>
      <p>A number of paragraphs in the draft framework were bracketed, including several references to the Protocol.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Ashe said Parties' comments and amendments would be taken into consideration when reviewing the framework and draft decision. Developing Countries: VANUATU, on behalf of the LDCs, urged explicit reference to the group's submissions in the revised text as a separate section, to ensure that it provides for the needs of the LDCs.</p>
      <p>Due to the lack of time, consideration of the framework for capacity building in developing countries was deferred to the next contact group meeting.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_7">
      <h2>JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE</h2>
      <small>SBI/SBSTA — groups</small>
      <p>Parties discussed sections in the Co-Chairs' text addressing general provisions, outcomes and consequences, and other provisions.</p>
      <p>On general provisions, Parties differed on the need for text on principles, and agreed that the text on functions was superfluous, given subsequent elaboration of functions.</p>
      <p>On adoption, JAPAN said COP-6 could recommend that the COP/MOP adopt a decision.</p>
      <p>The EU presented two options: adoption of a decision by COP-6 that would have immediate interim effect, accompanied by a recommendation to COP/MOP-1 to adopt an identical instrument; and adoption of a legal instrument that would enter into force at the same time as the Protocol.</p>
      <p>Parties supported different options based on their positions on the need for binding consequences. On consequences of non-compliance, the G-77/CHINA expressed interest in the EU proposal on financial penalties linked to a compliance fund.</p>
      <p>The EU emphasized the role of P&amp;Ms in compliance action plans and, opposed by AUSTRALIA and CHILE, advocated an open-ended list of facilitation consequences.</p>
      <p>The US said the facilitation branch should not apply mandatory outcomes.</p>
      <p>The RUSSIAN FEDERATION highlighted concerns relating to, inter alia: publication of potential non-compliance, initiation by the facilitation branch of the enforcement procedure; and the calculation of excess tonnes to be deducted from a Party's assigned amount.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, supported the following consequences: a compliance action plan, restrictions on the use of mechanisms, and a compliance fund.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA opposed financial penalties and the issuing of cautions.</p>

    <div id="section_8">
      <h2>SPECIAL SESSION ON LULUCF AND THE CDM</h2>
      <small>SBI/SBSTA</small>
      <p>In a special session, delegates considered the issue of including LULUCF projects within the CDM.</p>
      <p>BRAZIL, PERU, CHILE, COLOMBIA, NEW ZEALAND, COSTA RICA, BOLIVIA, AUSTRALIA, the US, JAPAN, URUGUAY, CANADA, NORWAY and the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP argued in favor of its inclusion, citing a variety of motivations and preconditions.</p>
      <p>The EU, TUVALU, SAMOA, CHINA and JAMAICA urged that the CDM exclude provision for sinks. Concerns with the inclusion of LULUCF CDM projects included: uncertainty; leakage; non-permanence; methodological issues in determining baselines; the potential for promoting inappropriate forestry; geographic and inter-generational inequity; and the potential size of LULUCF CDM credits enabling avoidance of emissions reductions. Arguments in favor of CDM projects included: their potential contribution to sustainable development in developing countries, and the importance of carbon sequestration.</p>
      <p>Proponents of LULUCF projects argued that many of the technical concerns are not unique to sinks projects, and that they may be addressed through appropriate project design.</p>
      <p>They suggested that the key distinguishing feature of sinks projects is permanence, and argued that this may be addressed, citing a recent position paper by Colombia. Preconditions for LULUCF CDM projects included: agreeing on sound methodologies for baselines and accounting; ensuring coherence with international conventions relating to biodiversity, forests, and wetlands; protection of the rights and concerns of indigenous people; ensuring that first-time methodologies for baseline crediting for sinks are approved by the Executive Board; and agreeing on CDM rules to address leakage and permanence.</p>

    <div id="section_9">
      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>SBI/SBSTA — corridors</small>
      <p>Some observers expressed concern Thursday regarding the process used in formulating and presenting some conclusions and decisions in the contact groups.</p>
      <p>They alleged that some text that had not been discussed previously was 'slipped in surreptitiously,' while in other cases Parties' submissions appeared to have been 'conveniently ignored.</p>
      <p>' However, others noted that it was an arduous task to cope with the various group texts and proposals emerging.</p>
