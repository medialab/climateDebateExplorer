      <h2>FINANCIAL MECHANISM (UNFCCC)</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF): On Tuesday morning, Philip Weech, Secretariat, noted that discussions on operationalizing the SCCF would proceed based on the draft text from Annex I of the report of SBI 22 (FCCC/SBI/2005/10).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_2">
      <h2>GEF Report to the COP</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Richard Hosier, GEF, summarized the GEF report to the COP (FCCC/SBI/2005/3).</p>
      <p>Commenting on financial matters, the Philippines, for the G-77/CHINA, underlined 'grave concerns' on matters relating to the financial mechanism, questioning whether the GEF Council had a mandate to decide that the World Bank will be the trustee for the Adaptation Fund, or whether the World Bank consequently has the authority to establish a Multi-Donor Trust Fund to disburse funding.</p>
      <p>She also expressed concern that the new GEF Resource Allocation Framework (RAF) will not enhance transparency and could make it harder to operationalize the Adaptation Fund, and that co-financing requirements present a barrier to LDCs and SIDS accessing funds.</p>
      <p>AOSIS, with others, added that the Adaptation Fund should be administered by the COP rather than by the GEF/World Bank.</p>
      <p>BANGLADESH said the COP, and not just the GEF Council, should determine the allocation of the LDC Fund.</p>
      <p>JAPAN, opposed by TANZANIA, URUGUAY and others, said any discussion on capacity building related to the GEF report should be included under the agenda item on the financial mechanism rather than under the item on capacity building related to the Convention.</p>

      <h2>Implementation of Decision 5/CP.8</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Concerning implementation of decision 5/CP.8 (developing countries investment needs), the Secretariat introduced a document outlining information relevant to investment needs of developing countries for fulfilling their UNFCCC commitments (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.7).</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA said this information should be used to achieve a fair and balanced review of the Conventions financial mechanism.</p>
      <p>A contact group on the financial mechanism was established.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4">

      <small></small>
      <p>Adaptation Fund: The G-77/CHINA emphasized that for developing countries, having the GEF and World Bank acting as trustee would not be the best option for managing the Fund.</p>
      <p>TUVALU and BANGLADESH urged the Fund to focus on concrete projects, and said COP/MOP should exercise its authority in administrating the Fund.</p>

      <p>He said the programme would require increased financial support. Malaysia, for the G-77/CHINA, said a COP decision should provide guidance on the review of EGTT; stressed that new approaches to technology transfer should be consistent with the objectives of the UNFCCC; recommended a high-level round table on technology cooperation and partnerships; and urged additional resources for EGTT.</p>

      <p>He added that a report on the GEFs activities, including using the World Bank as a trustee, was provided to COP 8 (FCCC/SBI/2002/4), and that the reason for a multi-donor trust fund is that funding comes from CDM proceeds and from Annex I Parties directly.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>SBI plenary discussions on the relationship between the GEF and the COP spilled into the hallways on Tuesday, as several delegates drew linkages between these discussions and donor differences over the size of the fourth GEF replenishment.</p>
      <p>Some already seem unhappy with the way the GEF operates, feeling that possible funding cuts would make it an even less appealing option.</p>
      <p>The introduction of the RAF also drew criticism from some, who noted that the RAF would make it more difficult for developing countries to access funding.</p>
      <p>However, others appeared more optimistic about the impact that the RAF might produce.</p>
