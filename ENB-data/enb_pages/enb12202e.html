    <h1>Earth Negotiations Bulletin: COP-8</h1>
    <p><b>Eighth Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</b></p>
    <p>24-Oct-02 &mdash; <a href="http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12202e.html">original report</a></p>
    <div id="section_enb12202e_1">
      <h2>OPENING SESSION</h2>
      <p>COP-7 President Mohamed Elyazghi (Morocco) declared COP-8 open.</p>
      <p>He drew attention to the Marrakesh Accords, noting that the process has moved to implementation. The COP elected T.R.</p>
      <p>Baalu, Indian Minister of Environment and Forests as COP-8 President by acclamation.</p>
      <p>COP-8 President Baalu welcomed participants, noting that impacts of climate change are already being felt.</p>
      <p>He stressed implementation, and highlighted those most vulnerable to climate change and the need for adaptation.</p>
      <p>He said that a consensus-based 'Delhi Declaration' addressing climate change and sustainable development would be an important COP-8 outcome. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter stressed the linkage between poverty and environment made at the WSSD.</p>
      <p>On facilitating information exchange between Parties, she explained that the Secretariat would do so by hosting authoritative databases of emissions, and of policies and measures (P&amp;Ms).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12202e_10">
      <h2>NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
      <p>Improvement of guidelines: The Secretariat introduced the proposed improved guidelines for non-Annex I national communications and the compilation of Parties submissions.</p>
      <p>Presenting an overview of funding for the initial national communications, the GEF noted 137 countries had received US$ 80 million, which represents 8% of total funding under its climate change focal area.</p>
      <p>The GEF expressed concern about the inestimable funding requirements of proposed guidelines for developing local emissions factors and on vulnerability and adaptation assessments, and remarked that without these funding requirements would only be marginally higher than current levels. The EU said that LDC national adaptation programmes of action should be considered in national communications.</p>
      <p>The CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, with BANGLADESH and ERITREA, highlighted LDCs difficulties in developing national communications and called on SBSTA to address financial support.</p>
      <p>INDIA, supported by THAILAND and IRAN, noted that the improved guidelines should not exceed the UNFCCCs reporting requirements.</p>
      <p>CANADA, with the EU, highlighted the need for demand-driven financing.</p>
      <p>TUVALU drew attention to possible negative implications of tying adaptation finance to the completion of national communications.</p>
      <p>JAPAN called for the chairs text to reflect a balance between mitigation and adaptation reporting requirements.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12202e_11">
      <h2>CGE</h2>
      <p>The Secretariat introduced Parties submissions.</p>
      <p>CGE Chair Mahendra Kumar (Fiji) presented the final report of the CGE, stressing that the CGE process plays an important role in capacity-building through the sharing of experiences, and the evaluation of technical problems and constraints.</p>
      <p>The CGE proposed several recommendations, including that additional financial and technical resources be mobilized, and that the IPCC develop methods and tools for assessing impacts on time scales relevant to policy-makers.</p>
      <p>SBI Chair Estrada said a contact group chaired by José Romero (Switzerland) would consider the agenda item.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="section_enb12202e_16">
      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>With both the outgoing and incoming COP Presidents stressing that the climate change process is shifting from drafting to implementation, the lack of buzz in the halls of the Vigyan Bhawan seemed to confirm that the action is elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Many conference participants remarked that this COP seemed as low-key as a meeting of the subsidiary bodies.</p>
      <p>However, other observers said they were excited to meet a multitude of Southern NGOs that are not normally at COPs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12202e_2">
      <h2>ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS</h2>
      <p>The Secretariat noted that 185 states and 1 regional organization have ratified the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>He said Afghanistan had deposited its instrument of ratification on 19 September.</p>
      <p>On the provisional agenda (FCCC/CP/2002/1, Add.1 and Add.2), the G-77/CHINA urged exclusion of Canadas proposal for a decision on modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts under Protocol Article 7.4 (registries) in relation to cleaner energy exports.</p>
      <p>The EU said this issue would be addressed by the SBI.</p>
      <p>He opposed Saudi Arabias request to include discussion on implementation of Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of P&amp;Ms) on the agenda.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA said the issue was unfinished business from the BAPA and stressed preparation of a draft decision for COP/MOP-1.</p>
      <p>CANADA emphasized the cleaner energy proposal as a priority for the future success of the Protocol.</p>
      <p>The agenda was adopted with these items, and the issue of the second review of the adequacy of commitments, held in abeyance. President Baalu noted that consultations continued on the election of officers other than the President.</p>
      <p>He said the high-level segment would take place in the form of three consecutive round- tables on 30 and 31 October on the theme of climate change and sustainable development. The G-77/CHINA expressed disappointment at the low level of financial resources provided by Annex I Parties, stressing that action so far has been symbolic.</p>
      <p>Supported by AUSTRALIA, for the Umbrella Group, he underscored the importance of linking sustainable development and climate change.</p>
      <p>Stressing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, CHINA said the climate regime should take into account the rising energy demands that will occur as the quality of life in developing countries improves.</p>
      <p>ZIMBABWE, for the Africa Group, called for increased support for adaptation projects.</p>
