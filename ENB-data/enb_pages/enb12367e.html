      <p>However, both agreed to the suggestion, and parties adopted the agenda as proposed.</p>

      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>The High-Level Conference on World Food Security taking place in Rome was generating some talk in the corridors in Bonn, with a few delegates drawing connections to the post-2012 discussions, particularly regarding the role of biofuels.</p>
      <p>The excitement is all in Rome right now, said one negotiator, adding that a greater sense of urgency might be needed in Bonn to get through the heavy workload.</p>
      <p>Some delegates were also talking about financing issues.</p>
      <p>Several commented on the Adaptation Fund, Resource Allocation Framework, and funding for NAPA implementation - important issues for many developing countries and LDCs.</p>
      <p>There was also talk about the GEF s draft strategic programme, and speculation on how some developing country concerns with the financial mechanism might manifest themselves in the coming days.</p>
      <p>Looking further ahead, a growing number of participants were expressing concerns about the availability and cost of accommodation for COP 14 and COP/MOP 4 in Poznan, Poland, in December.</p>
      <p>I hope I don t end up sleeping in the snow in December!</p>
