      <h2>OPENING SESSION</h2>
      <p>COP-9 Vice President Mamadou Honadia (Burkina Faso), on behalf of COP-9 President Miklós Persányi (Hungary), introduced Ginés González García, Argentine Minister of Health and the Environment, who was elected President of COP-10 by acclamation.</p>
      <p>President González García emphasized that COP-10 is the last session prior to the Kyoto Protocols entry into force and the first session of a new chapter devoted to taking action.</p>
      <p>He stated that advanced research and knowledge must be accompanied by increased resources, and that commitments from all members of society are needed.</p>
      <p>Anibal Ibarra, Mayor of Buenos Aires, welcomed participants to Buenos Aires and highlighted the central role of local authorities in responding to climate change and raising public awareness. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter highlighted the tenth anniversary of the UNFCCC and the forthcoming entry into force of the Protocol.</p>
      <p>She presented a report of the UNFCCCs first decade, underlining the challenges that lie beyond 2012 and suggested that Parties consider an equitable and effective strategy to ensure that all countries contribute fairly to achieving the UNFCCCs objectives. Numerous speakers welcomed the Russian Federations ratification of the Protocol and expressed hope that the US would also ratify the Protocol.</p>
      <p>QATAR, for the G-77/China, noted the impacts of recent climate-related disasters on developing countries, and called for renewed commitment by the international community.</p>
      <p>He said that adaptation, technology transfer and capacity building should remain high on the policy agenda.</p>
      <p>He emphasized Annex I Parties responsibility for financial resource mobilization for adaptation, stressing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The NETHERLANDS, for the EU, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, expressed continued commitment to addressing climate change and highlighted the launch of the EU emissions trading scheme in January 2005.</p>
      <p>He supported limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, noting that a greater increase would result in irreversible damages.</p>
      <p>TUVALU, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), highlighted the need for strong linkages with the 10-year review of the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (BPOA+10) and the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR), and emphasized the importance of dialogue on adaptation. Noting that the first commitment period is only an initial step, SWITZERLAND, for the Environmental Integrity Group, urged Parties to consider ways and means to address climate change challenges beyond 2012.</p>
      <p>KENYA, for the Africa Group, stressed the need for progress in the implementation of decision 5/CP.7.</p>
      <p>TANZANIA, for the LDCs, expressed concern at the slow disbursement of funds for the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPA).</p>
      <p>The RUSSIAN FEDERATION explained that Protocol ratification had been a difficult decision for his country.</p>
      <p>NIGERIA informed Parties of his countrys impending ratification of the Protocol.</p>
      <p>The COMOROS noted that adaptation is crucial for many vulnerable countries.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA said that targets for the second commitment period should be limited to Annex B Parties, and should not include developing country Parties.</p>
      <p>EGYPT stressed the need to promote funding, technology transfer and CDM activities.</p>

      <p>LEG Chair Laavasa Malua (Samoa) presented the LEGs meeting report, highlighting the completion of a draft recommendation on LDC capacity-building needs.</p>
      <p>TANZANIA, for the LDCs, emphasized the need to strengthen national focal points and institutions and to ensure that the LEG continues to provide guidance during NAPA implementation.</p>
      <p>MAURITIUS called for adequate support for LEG activities during 2005. The EU suggested that discussions on LDCs should take into account deliberations on decision 5/CP.7, in order to avoid duplication.</p>
      <p>Opposed by UGANDA, SWITZERLAND proposed conducting a compilation and synthesis of the first NAPAs.</p>
      <p>AOSIS urged the implementation of NAPAs immediately following their completion.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>With the Russian Federations ratification and the long anticipated entering into force of the Kyoto Protocol on the horizon, delegates entered Plenary on Monday morning with positive spirits.</p>
      <p>Several participants welcomed the cooperative attitude shown by Canada on its withdrawal of its perennially controversial agenda item on cleaner energy exports.</p>
      <p>With one or two countries voicing dissatisfaction with an agenda item on inputs to BPOA+10 and WCDR, some expressed concern that this may be a premonition of future debates in those processes and feared attempts to play down links between climate change and disasters. Looking forward to the next two weeks, several participants also pointed out that adaptation will be a hotly contested issue.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12250e_2">
      <h2>ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS</h2>
      <p>President González García informed Parties that the Kyoto Protocol now has 129 ratifications and will enter into force on 16 February 2005.</p>
      <p>He stated that despite intersessional consultations, Rule 42 (voting) of the rules of procedures remains unresolved, and said he will conduct informal consultations. President González García then introduced the provisional agenda for adoption.</p>
      <p>CANADA withdrew its proposal on cleaner energy exports, in the spirit of moving discussions forward.</p>
      <p>The EU, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed deleting the agenda item on matters relating to Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures). The US, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and opposed by ARGENTINA, AOSIS, the EU and MAURITIUS, disputed discussion on inputs from the COP to the BPOA+10 and WCDR.</p>
      <p>Following informal discussions, Parties agreed to consider an 'exchange of views on UNFCCC activities relevant to other intergovernmental meetings,' with a footnote in the agenda stating that the exchange of views will be reflected in the COP-10 report and serve to assist the Executive Secretary in reporting to these meetings.</p>
      <p>Parties adopted the agenda, with Article 2.3 and the review of Article 4.2(a) and (b) (Annex I commitments) held in abeyance. The election of officers other than the President is postponed until nominations have been finalized.</p>
      <p>The COP approved the admission of organizations as observers.</p>
      <p>Regarding the date and venue of COP-11 and the procedure for the appointment of an Executive Secretary, Parties agreed that further consultations are necessary.</p>
      <p>President González García said he will prepare a non-negotiated summary of the high-level panel discussions.</p>

      <p>SENEGAL stressed the need to guarantee benefits to low income communities.</p>
      <p>JAPAN, supported by CANADA, said simplified modalities and procedures are necessary to reduce transaction costs, and the EU said simplified modalities and procedures should avoid overestimating carbon credits or compromising the Protocols environmental integrity.</p>

      <p>AOSIS urged greater progress in methodologies to attribute and account for aviation and maritime emissions in the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND, opposed by the US, welcomed discussions on allocating emissions from international aviation and maritime transport.</p>
      <p>The US and CANADA said inventory issues should be taken up at SB-22.</p>
      <p>INDIA said allocation is a political issue that should be addressed by the UNFCCC and IPCC, not by the International Civil Aviation Organization and International Maritime Organization.</p>
      <p>Informal consultations, facilitated by Eduardo Calvo (Peru), will further address this issue.</p>
