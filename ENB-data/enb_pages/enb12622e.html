      <h2>FINANCE:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>On Section G, Bolivia, for the G-77/CHINA, supported by Egypt, for the AFRICAN GROUP, suggested that the agreement be arranged in clusters on, inter alia : scale of resources; assessment and review; and sources of finance.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA proposed that the Convention s financial mechanism serve the 2015 agreement along with the Kyoto Protocol s financial bodies, and with the GCF as the main operating entity.</p>

      <p>The EU proposed that all parties individually and collectively mobilize climate finance with developed country leadership.</p>
      <p>JAPAN opposed limiting the requirement to provide finance to Annex II parties.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA suggested replacing reference to countries in annexes with language on all parties in a position to do so, and encouraged the mobilization of finance from a variety of sources. NORWAY proposed maximizing and incentivizing ambitious mitigation actions, including through payments based on verified results.</p>
      <p>The US stressed the need to strengthen recipient country reporting of financial flows.</p>
      <p>Highlighting fossil fuel subsidies, she stressed the importance of phasing out high-carbon investment.</p>
      <p>NEW ZEALAND stressed the need to ensure that climate finance and investments deliver effective outcomes.</p>
      <p>The LDCs suggested that half of adaptation finance be allocated to SIDS and LDCs.</p>
      <p>He called for: a loss and damage finance window; a replenishment cycle for the GCF; financial support to be periodically reviewed and scaled up; an ICAO/IMO levy for adaptation finance; and new sources of finance.</p>
      <p>Panama, for CfRN, suggested separate finance windows for REDD+, and loss and damage. SWITZERLAND proposed a common transparency framework, which would evolve over time and be applicable to all parties, encompassing delivery, use and impact of support.</p>
      <p>Ecuador, for LMDCs, said developed countries should submit information on their financial contributions and developing countries on their needs.</p>
      <p>Chile, for AILAC, suggested a new guiding principle that all investments become low-emission and resilient to climate impacts in the context of the mitigation goal.</p>
      <p>BOLIVIA suggested establishing a climate resilience and sustainable development mechanism.</p>
      <p>KIRIBATI suggested recognizing the need for a special mechanism to fast-track action to assist the most vulnerable countries.</p>

      <h2>CAPACITY BUILDING:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Many developing country parties underscored that their enhanced climate change actions will depend on MOI provided by developed countries.</p>
      <p>Maldives, for AOSIS, proposed an international capacity-building mechanism, comprised of a coordination center that compiles information; analyzes gaps and trends; develops tools and methodologies; matches available support with identified needs; and coordinates and cooperates with UNFCCC bodies and other relevant entities.</p>
      <p>Egypt, for the LMDCs, and INDONESIA emphasized that a capacity-building mechanism should be based on experience sharing, lessons learned and best practices.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, stressed that any support coming from developing country parties should not interfere with the nature, scope or substance of developing parties INDCs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_6">
      <h2>TRANSPARENCY OF ACTION AND SUPPORT:</h2>

      <p>Jordan, for the LMDCs, called for a finance registry and for reporting on finance using a common format.</p>
      <p>CHINA proposed that information on MOI by developed countries be verified through a technical review process, followed by a multilateral assessment process and conclusions with compliance consequences.</p>
      <p>He suggested that developing countries report on their climate action consistent with the level of support received and that the information be subject to a technical analysis followed by a facilitative sharing of views among parties, on the basis of a non-intrusive, non-punitive process that is respectful of national sovereignty. SWITZERLAND proposed a common accounting and tracking system to safeguard environmental integrity and avoid double counting of internationally transferable mitigation outcomes from cooperative arrangements.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>working group — corridors</small>
      <p>On Monday, the ADP contact group continued considering new textual proposals added to the draft negotiating text.</p>
      <p>As discussions finished at 5:30 pm, delegates had managed to cover four new sections, with five remaining.</p>
      <p>Some expressed appreciation for the Co-Chairs efforts to keep delegates focused on the task at hand, with frequent reminders to stick to the agreed mode of work.</p>
      <p>The length of the final text was also subject to some speculation, as the revised mitigation section had grown from 4 to 12 pages.</p>
      <p>This caused some to worry that the text might swell considerably by the end of the session.</p>
      <p>Some were also wondering whether parties would actually refrain from adding text at a later stage of the negotiations.</p>
      <p>In the evening, many delegates stayed in the meeting room for a briefing on support for INDCs.</p>
      <p>The event consisted of several presentations and parties exchanging views on the INDC process.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries stressed the importance of comprehensive support for all INDC components, not only mitigation.</p>
      <p>Developed countries highlighted various support activities, such as France s new INDC Support Facility.</p>
