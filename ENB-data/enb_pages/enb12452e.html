      <h2>CDM (COP/MOP):</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>During the contact group, Co-Chair Figueres informed parties that the Co-Chairs had prepared draft decision text, based on the CDM Executive Board (EB) report to the COP/MOP and parties statements during the COP/MOP Plenary.</p>
      <p>Parties discussed the CDM EB s study on the implications of including CCS under the CDM.</p>
      <p>The Secretariat provided clarification on the process by which the CDM EB conducted the study, as requested by the COP/MOP President during the COP/MOP plenary. GRENADA and SAUDI ARABIA asked how the second report from the consultants tasked with conducting the study had been dealt with, with GRENADA noting that the CDM EB did not endorse this second report.</p>
      <p>The Secretariat clarified that consultants had been requested to conduct the study, that their first report did not adequately fulfill the mandate given to them and they had been asked to prepare a second report, but the CDM EB had been unable to make a decision on this report.</p>
      <p>He further explained that: the consultants first report was part of the annotated agenda of the 49th meeting of the Board; the consultants second report was part of the annotated agenda of the 50th meeting and considered during the meeting; and the main outcome of the CDM EB s study is contained in Annex II of its report ( FCCC/KP/CMP/2009/16 ).</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Figures noted that because the CDM EB had been unable to conclude on the study and mandate given to it by the COP/MOP, the matter was now back before the COP/MOP.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Figueres then asked parties to identify issues which should be discussed by the group.</p>
      <p>The EU highlighted: the issue of unmet need, particularly in order to improve regional distribution of CDM projects; standardized baselines; understaffing of the Secretariat; terms of reference for CDM EB members; and the possibility of a full-time CDB EB chair.</p>
      <p>CHINA identified the need to improve transparency, fairness and efficiency in decision-making.</p>
      <p>Ethiopia, for the LDCs, underscored regional distribution, and proposed exempting small-scale projects in LDCs from the additionality requirement.</p>
      <p>He also noted that many LDCs have unmet energy needs and requested that this be considered for the establishment of baselines.</p>
      <p>GRENADA and BRAZIL opposed the proposal for a full-time chair, noting the existence of a full-time Secretariat and highlighting that the proposal would only favor those countries that can afford to support a full-time chair.</p>
      <p>GRENADA also objected to adopting terms of reference for CDM EB members, highlighting that it may bias countries with limited CDM knowledge and expertise.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA supported consideration of terms of reference.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Figueres then introduced the Co-Chairs draft text, provided an overview of its content and asked parties if it was an acceptable starting point.</p>
      <p>GRENADA and JAPAN expressed support for using the text as a starting point.</p>
      <p>The INTERNATIONAL EMISSIONS TRADING ASSOCIATION (IETA) supported establishment of standardized baselines, stating this would improve regional distribution.</p>
      <p>She also highlighted, inter alia : lack of due process and transparency in the CDM EB s decision-making process and the need to establish an independent appeal body; and the prerogative of the host country to set the level of incentives to promote CDM projects.</p>
      <p>CDM Watch, for CAN, expressed concern about the code of conduct for CDM EB members, particularly regarding declaration of conflicts of interest, and called for strengthening of the code of conduct and establishing procedures for declaring such conflicts.</p>
      <p>She also opposed the definition of forests in exhaustion and the inclusion of CCS under CDM projects. JOINT IMPLEMENTATION (JI) (COP/MOP): Co-Chair Lesolle identified the following issues as requiring consideration: resources for the JI Supervisory Committee (JISC), including the JI management and budget plans for 2010-2011 and the need for predictable and adequate funding; further guidance to the JISC as appropriate; and guidance to the Secretariat regarding the JI track 1 procedure, including information from parties and input by the Secretariat.</p>
      <p>The Secretariat presented a summary of the JISC report, including an overview of the operation and status of JI.</p>
      <p>CHINA noted that the Chair had not mentioned the issue of extending the share of proceeds levy to JI, as raised by parties in plenary.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Lesolle noted that this could be included under further guidance on JI. IETA lamented the lack of sufficient funding for JISC.</p>
      <p>He noted that lack of progress on aspects of JI lies in inadequacy of host country mechanisms to facilitate JI tracks 1 and 2 procedures.</p>
      <p>The Co-Chairs will prepare a draft decision for consideration on Friday. SHARED VISION (AWG-LCA): In the afternoon informal consultations, parties focused on draft text.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries proposed new language to condense several introductory paragraphs.</p>
      <p>Some developed countries opposed a reference to addressing implementation gaps in the Convention.</p>
      <p>Parties also deliberated on the role of the Protocol.</p>
      <p>Informal consultations continued into the night aimed at completing the first reading of the draft text. FINANCE (AWG-LCA): In the morning drafting group on finance, delegates considered the co-facilitators text on institutional arrangements, proposing changes to the text.</p>
      <p>Several parties expressed difficulty with, amongst other things, listing commitments contained in Convention Article 4 (commitments) and language on a governing body allocating funds among thematic areas.</p>
      <p>Revised text will be produced. TECHNOLOGY (AWG-LCA): In informal consultations on technology, parties worked line-by-line through new draft text.</p>
      <p>Some developing countries expressed interest in inserting preambular language and principles.</p>
      <p>Parties exchanged views on what a technology mechanism would consist of. ADAPTATION (AWG-LCA): In the morning informal consultations on adaptation, parties continued paragraph-by-paragraph discussions of draft text with a view to streamlining and shortening it.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Much of the talk in the corridors on Thursday afternoon and evening was focused on the suspension of both the COP and COP/MOP, pending consultations on whether to establish contact groups to consider proposed new protocols under the Convention and proposed amendments to the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>As on Wednesday when the COP was suspended, Tuvalu led a group of African, Latin American and AOSIS parties in urging a formal contact group to consider the proposed Protocol amendments, and resisted proposals to move the procedural question to an informal setting with a review of progress in plenary on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Many noted that these disputes were closely related to the question concerning the legal form of the outcome: We have still not resolved the critical question of the legal outcome of these negotiations, noted one old hand in the process.</p>
      <p>Developing countries want to preserve and strengthen Kyoto, while most Annex I countries are seeking a comprehensive legal framework that also engages the US and developing countries in mitigation efforts.</p>
      <p>Differences were also detected among developing countries as to whether the outcome from the AWG-LCA should be legally-binding.</p>
      <p>The wisdom of suspending work under COP and COP/MOP and its implications were also being discussed around the Bella Center.</p>
      <p>Some viewed the request to also suspend the COP/MOP as a good strategic move, while others feared it could delay work on other issues.</p>
      <p>It hasn t slowed the informals under the AWG-LCA, said one NGO who was supportive of AOSIS stand.</p>
      <p>I m just not sure how they ll break the deadlock, she added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, delegates were also reacting to the leak of a proposed outcome document - the Copenhagen Accord - by French newspaper Le Monde .</p>
      <p>The text, which was said to have been developed by China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, had apparently been distributed among G-77/China parties earlier in the week before the leak on Thursday.</p>
      <p>While the initial response to the text was cautious, some developed country delegates seemed positively surprised by what they characterized as a relatively realistic text.</p>
      <p>For their part, some of those connected with the text were playing down its significance at this stage, with delegates noting that it has limited status and is just a working draft.</p>
      <p>People were also commenting on the increasing number of people at the Bella Center on Thursday, as more ministers arrived and delegations continued to grow.</p>
      <p>Lines to get into the building were noticeably longer than in previous days, and there was talk of limits on observer numbers next week.</p>
      <p>The place is already packed and there ll be thousands more next week, noted one insider.</p>
      <p>Rumors were also circulating about large-scale protests planned for Saturday.</p>
