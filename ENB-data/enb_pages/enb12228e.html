      <h2>NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
      <p>Parties continued consideration of draft conclusions and draft COP decisions throughout the day.</p>
      <p>On a draft decision on submission of national communications, the G-77/CHINA suggested text stating that submissions shall be dependent on the availability of funding.</p>
      <p>The EU, US and AUSTRALIA favored text requiring that second national communications be submitted within three years of the availability of financial resources.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA underlined that it would not discuss the issue of frequency of submissions.</p>
      <p>The US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, recommended text requiring non-Annex I Parties to submit national inventories every two years.</p>
