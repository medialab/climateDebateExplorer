      <h2>HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT</h2>
      <small>COP — plenary</small>
      <p>Opening the segment, COP-9 President Persányi commended delegates' commitment to action and leadership.</p>
      <p>He noted that the UNFCCC and its Protocol are the only viable options for preventing dangerous interference with the global climate.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Altero Matteoli, Italy's Minister for the Environment and Territory, said the Draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe provides for EU Member States to fulfill their obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, José Antonio Ocampo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, encouraged Annex I Parties who have not yet ratified the Protocol to do so as soon as possible and emphasized the importance of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p>Joke Waller- Hunter, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, said COP-9 has demonstrated that, in the presence of commitment and political will, it is possible to establish sound institutional frameworks for action.</p>

      <p>She also said the SBI would request the Secretariat to review the implications of this on developing countries and EITs and report to SBI-20 on this matter. Chair Stoycheva closed SBI-19 at 01:16 am.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>On the sixth anniversary of the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, frustration over lack of progress was clear.</p>
      <p>Convening in a late night Plenary to adopt SBI conclusions, Parties continued to deliberate on issues not agreed to during the contact groups and informal consultations.</p>
      <p>Observers noted that while the sinks in the CDM issue, which was generally expected to cause the greatest troubles at COP-9, had been resolved, the controversy of the developing country issues had been underestimated.</p>
      <p>This was evident both in the heated debates around the SCCF, referred to by one delegate as 'opening Pandora's Box,' and in consideration of non-Annex I national communications.</p>
      <p>Several shaken delegates said the EU's lack of resistance over deferring consideration of submission of second and, where appropriate, third national communications to SB-20 was wholly out of line with the EU's negotiating mandate.</p>
      <p>The surprise was equally evident among some developing country delegates, who met this give-away of bargaining power with concealed laughter of disbelief.</p>
