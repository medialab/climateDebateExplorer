      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Delegates were voicing a range of hopes, fears and expectations on the opening day of the PoznaÅ conference.</p>
      <p>Many recognized that the meeting was a halfway point on the road from Bali to Copenhagen, meaning that few concrete outcomes could be expected.</p>
      <p>However, there was also a sense that some forward momentum would be needed.</p>
      <p>Focus and urgency were two commonly-used words, with many hoping for signs of progress in the AWG-KP talks on the big picture and in the AWG-LCA s discussions on the assembly paper and a shared vision.</p>
      <p>Many delegates in the AWG-LCA opening session on Monday afternoon seemed singularly unimpressed by the dispute over whether to form a contact group to discuss a shared vision.</p>
      <p>I thought we had agreed on this already, said one.</p>
      <p>Can you believe that there was no shared vision on forming a contact group on shared vision?</p>
      <p>asked another.</p>
      <p>However, several participants observed that the issue is already set to be discussed in a workshop and ministerial roundtable, asking whether it needed a contact group just yet.</p>
      <p>The heavy agenda and multiple formal groups meeting in PoznaÅ were also weighing on some delegates minds.</p>
      <p>I m not ruling out a successful meeting, but it won t be easy with six formal bodies taking place here, said one observer.</p>
