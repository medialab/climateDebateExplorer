      <h2>CONSULTATIONS ON POST-2012</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Consultations on how to move forward post-2012 took place throughout Thursday in numerous meetings focused both on the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>Many Parties appeared to support moving forward under multiple tracks involving Protocol Articles 3.9 (future commitments) and 9 (review of the Protocol) and the UNFCCC, although some concerns remained about various elements in this 'package' approach.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_14">
      <h2>FUTURE ACTIONS UNDER THE UNFCCC</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Informal discussions on future actions under the UNFCCC focused on President Dions revised proposal.</p>
      <p>Under the proposal, Parties would resolve to engage in discussions on cooperative action to address climate change, including advancing development goals sustainably, reducing impacts on developing countries, and acting on adaptation, technology and market issues.</p>
      <p>Parties would also agree to hold workshops open to all Parties and to complete discussions at COP 13.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_15">
      <h2>PROTOCOL ARTICLE 3.9</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Following meetings held throughout the day, Co-Chairs Alf Wills (South Africa) and David Drake (Canada) convened a contact group and introduced a bracketed draft containing two options with four sections each.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Wills explained that the first section contains a decision, the second section addresses issues raised in relation to the 'global response,' the third deals with issues related to Article 9 (review of the Protocol), and the fourth addresses both the global response and Article 9. Shortly before 9:00 pm, delegates agreed to the text as presented.</p>
      <p>As of 11:15 pm, President Dion was holding a high-level meeting to discuss the entire 'package' of issues on post-2012.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_16">
      <h2>CONSULTATIONS ON ADAPTATION</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Informal consultations were held throughout the day in an attempt to remove brackets from the draft COP decision.</p>
      <p>Under discussion was reference to SIDS in the objective of the programme of work, economic diversification, and reference to the Arctic, along with LDCs and SIDS, as particularly vulnerable regions.</p>
      <p>Consultations continued throughout the day.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_17">
      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Progress on Article 3.9 on Thursday night had some delegates smiling but 'vaguely confused.</p>
      <p>' The agreement on a bracketed decision that sets out various options for how to proceed was being interpreted as 'highly unusual but still a positive outcome' by one insider.</p>
      <p>Further high-level discussions were taking place late on Thursday night on the entire package of issues. While news from the small group negotiations was positive, some concerns were being expressed about the dwindling numbers in plenary.</p>
      <p>Many ministers and high-level officials were left to address a largely empty hall, prompting several delegates to propose a more 'interactive' approach involving thematic roundtables and panel discussions.</p>
      <p>However, no one disputed the overall usefulness of the high-level segment, which increases visibility and political commitment to the process, and allows for a multitude of bilateral meetings to take place. In other talk, many participants seemed excited at the imminent prospect of former US President Bill Clintons visit on Friday.</p>
