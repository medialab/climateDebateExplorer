      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small>HISTORY</small>
      <p>The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992, which sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994 and now has 194 parties.</p>
      <p>In December 1997, delegates to COP 3 in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission reduction targets.</p>
      <p>These countries, known as Annex I parties under the UNFCCC, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and now has 192 parties.</p>
      <p>In 2005, COP/MOP 1, held in Montreal, Canada, established the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol on the basis of Protocol Article 3.9, which mandates consideration of Annex I parties further commitments at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period.</p>
      <p>In addition, COP 11 agreed in Montreal to consider long-term cooperation under the Convention through a series of four workshops known as the Convention Dialogue, which continued until COP 13.</p>

      <h2>BALI ROADMAP:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 took place in December 2007 in Bali, Indonesia.</p>
      <p>Negotiations resulted in the adoption of the Bali Action Plan (BAP), which established the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention with a mandate to focus on key elements of long-term cooperation identified during the Convention Dialogue: mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology transfer.</p>
      <p>The Bali conference also resulted in agreement on a two-year process, the Bali Roadmap, which established two negotiating tracks under the Convention and the Protocol, and set a deadline for concluding the negotiations at COP 15 and COP/MOP 5 in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_3">
      <h2>FROM BALI TO COPENHAGEN:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In 2008, the two AWGs held four parallel negotiating sessions in: April in Bangkok, Thailand; June in Bonn, Germany; August in Accra, Ghana; and December in PoznanÌ, Poland.</p>
      <p>In 2009, the AWGs met in: April, June and August in Bonn, Germany; October in Bangkok, Thailand; November in Barcelona, Spain; and December in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4">
      <h2>AWG-LCA:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>For the AWG-LCA, the first part of 2009 focused on developing draft negotiating text.</p>
      <p>This process resulted in a text that was nearly 200 pages long and covered all the main elements of the BAP.</p>
      <p>Because of the length of the text, delegates began producing non-papers, reading guides, tables and matrices aimed at making the negotiating text more manageable.</p>
      <p>The outcome was a series of non-papers, forwarded to Copenhagen as an annex to the meeting report.</p>
      <p>Heading into Copenhagen, many felt the AWG-LCA had made satisfactory progress on adaptation, technology and capacity building, but that deep divides remained on mitigation and certain aspects of finance.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_5">
      <h2>AWG-KP:</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>For the AWG-KP, the focus in 2009 was on the numbers, namely Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions beyond 2012, when the Protocol s first commitment period expires.</p>
      <p>Parties also discussed other issues in the AWG-KP s work programme, including the flexibility mechanisms, land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) and potential consequences of response measures.</p>
      <p>The discussions were based on documentation divided into proposals for amendments to the Protocol under Article 3.9 and text on other issues, such as LULUCF and the flexibility mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Ahead of Copenhagen, many felt that insufficient progress had been made on Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions, and differences also surfaced between developed and developing countries concerning whether the outcome from Copenhagen should be an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol or a single new agreement bringing together the work done by the two AWGs.</p>

    <div id="section_6">
      <h2>COPENHAGEN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, took place from 7-19 December 2009, and included COP 15 and COP/MOP 5, the 31st sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), as well as AWG-KP 10 and AWG-LCA 8.</p>
      <p>Over 110 world leaders attended the joint COP and COP/MOP high-level segment from 16-18 December.</p>
      <p>The conference was marked by disputes over transparency and process.</p>
      <p>During the high-level segment, informal negotiations took place in a group consisting of major economies and representatives of regional and other negotiating groups.</p>
      <p>Late in the evening of 18 December, these talks resulted in a political agreement: the Copenhagen Accord, which was then brought to the COP plenary.</p>
      <p>Over the next 13 hours, delegates debated the Accord.</p>
      <p>Many supported adopting it in the form of a COP decision as a step towards securing a better future agreement.</p>
      <p>However, some developing countries opposed the Accord, which they felt had been reached through an untransparent and undemocratic process.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the COP agreed to take note of the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>They also established a process for parties to indicate their support for the Accord and, to date, 140 countries have indicated their support.</p>
      <p>More than 80 countries have also provided information on their emission reduction targets and other mitigation actions.</p>
      <p>On the last day of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, the COP and COP/MOP also agreed to extend the mandates of the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP, requesting them to present their respective outcomes to COP 16 and COP/MOP 6 in Cancun, Mexico. BONN CLIMATE CHANGE TALKS (APRIL AND JUNE 2010): Negotiations resumed in 2010 with AWG-LCA 9 and AWG-KP 11, which took place from 9-11 April.</p>
      <p>Their focus was on the organization and methods of work in 2010.</p>
      <p>In the AWG-LCA, delegates mandated the Chair to prepare text for the June session.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP agreed to continue considering Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions, as well as the other issues.</p>
      <p>Discussions continued in Bonn from 31 May to 11 June.</p>
      <p>AWG-LCA 10 focused on the Chair s new draft text.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of the meeting, AWG-LCA Chair Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe) circulated the advance draft of a revised text.</p>
      <p>Some developing countries felt that the advance draft was unbalanced and should not be used as the basis for negotiations in August unless their views were reflected more fully.</p>
      <p>A revised version of the Chair s draft text was circulated in July. AWG-KP 12 focused on Annex I emission reductions and other issues, including the flexibility mechanisms and LULUCF.</p>
      <p>It also addressed ways to avoid a gap between the first and subsequent commitment periods, and requested the Secretariat to prepare a paper on legal options for achieving this. BONN CLIMATE CHANGE TALKS (AUGUST 2010): AWG-LCA 11 considered the Chair s draft text circulated in July 2010 (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/8).</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP continued consideration of the scale of Annex I emission reductions under the Protocol and other issues.</p>
      <p>It also discussed legal matters, including a possible gap between the Protocol s first commitment period (2008-2012) and subsequent commitment periods.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP agreed to forward a Chair s draft proposal (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/ CRP.2) for further discussion in Tianjin.</p>

      <h2>TIANJIN CLIMATE CHANGE TALKS:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>The last round of negotiations before Cancun took place from 4-9 October 2010 in Tianjin, China.</p>
      <p>The AWG-LCA discussed a negotiating text (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/14), which encompasses the main elements of the BAP.</p>
      <p>The meeting sought to focus on issues that lend themselves to resolution in the time available before COP 16, bearing in mind the need to achieve balance.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to reflect their work in an information document prepared by the Secretariat and that the AWG-LCA negotiating text would remain the basis for negotiations in Cancun.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP considered the Chair s draft proposal presented at AWG-KP 13.</p>
      <p>The document contains several draft decisions on, inter alia , Protocol amendments under Article 3.9, flexibility mechanisms and LULUCF.</p>
      <p>Parties focused on narrowing down options and attempted to make progress on substantial issues.</p>
      <p>A revised Chair s proposal (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/CRP.3) will be considered in Cancun.</p>
