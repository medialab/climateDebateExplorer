      <p>SWITZERLAND, with the EU, proposed that the UNFCCC Secretariat regularly report on relevant WTO activities.</p>
      <p>CANADA, COLOMBIA and the US supported Chair Thorgeirssons suggestion that such reporting activities be undertaken at national level instead.</p>

      <p>The Secretariat noted the comprehensive review of the framework for capacity building at COP-9.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA stressed that the review process should contain an analysis of current project and programme implementation in response to decision 2/CP.7 (capacity building in developing countries), identify gaps and possible areas for further improvement in implementation, and outline steps to be undertaken by SBI in monitoring capacity-building activities.</p>
      <p>CANADA said that the review should also include activities undertaken prior to the COP- 7 decision.</p>
      <p>JAPAN cautioned against adopting standardized elements and guidelines for the review.</p>

      <p>The G-77/CHINA and AOSIS expressed concern that emissions could continue to rise, despite mitigation measures, and urged Annex I Parties to implement more rigorous policies and measures.</p>
      <p>Chair Stoycheva said that she would prepare draft conclusions on this issue.</p>

    <div id="section_10">

      <small></small>
      <p>The use of guidelines for the preparation of non- Annex I national communications: CUBA, with BURKINA FASO, the G-77/CHINA and TUVALU, said the implementation of the guidelines will require additional financial resources and capacity building, and, with the EU, emphasized the need to focus on vulnerability and adaptation, and greenhouse gas inventories.</p>

      <p>The EU encouraged Croatia to submit a consistent time series of emissions data using consistent methodologies for 1990-2001.</p>
      <p>BOSNIA and HERZEGOVINA, and SERBIA and MONTENEGRO indicated it could not support Croatias greenhouse gas emissions inventory adjustments for the 1990 base year.</p>
      <p>Jim Penman (UK) will facilitate informal consultations on the Croatian proposals.</p>

      <h2>PROGRAMME BUDGET</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Contact group Chair John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) presented a draft COP-9 decision containing three options on the draft budget and indicative scales that separate financing for UNFCCC and Protocol activities to differing degrees.</p>
      <p>The US stressed the importance of accounting methods, especially under the UNFCCC Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities, and, with JAPAN and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, requested indication of those activities directly related to the Protocol.</p>
      <p>CANADA, the US and the EU said budget decisions taken while the UNFCCC is in a 'transition period' could set a precedent for future decisions, and, with AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, requested a breakdown of costs associated with the three options in the Chairs paper.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_14">
      <h2>IMPLEMENTATION OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9</h2>

      <p>This contact group, co-chaired by Robert Mason (UK) and Fadhel Lari (Kuwait), met to consider progress on the implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7 (implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9).</p>
      <p>The EU, US and CANADA highlighted progress made, including the GEFs third replenishment, the establishment of the LDC Fund, and development of guidelines for NAPAs.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, AOSIS, KUWAIT and LIBYA, said that progress to date was insufficient and urged Parties to begin by examining the recommendations of the recent risk assessment and insurance workshops.</p>
      <p>The US, EU and AUSTRALIA objected to this suggestion.</p>
      <p>Following requests by NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, the US and EU, informal consultations were held on the agenda of the workshop on synergies scheduled for 2-4 July 2003, in Espoo, Finland.</p>

    <div id="section_15">
      <h2>PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Delegates discussed means to improve the professionalism and performance of the expert review teams (ERTs), and training.</p>
      <p>On improving ERT performance, Parties addressed proposed elements for inclusion in the Agreement for Expert Review Services.</p>
      <p>The EU, supported by ARGENTINA and BOLIVIA, said information provided by Parties for the inventory review could be used by the experts in preparing their countries inventories, but should not be disclosed to a third party.</p>
      <p>Addressing disclosure of information during the review process, Parties questioned whether the Party being reviewed would be privy to information on the review.</p>
      <p>Delegates also discussed whether information and observations can be shared with lead reviewers not on the review team.</p>
      <p>The US asked how conflicts of interest of ERT members might be addressed. On training, delegates discussed courses for experts, including the status of those who fail examinations, and whether examinations should be mandatory and courses should have final seminars.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Newton Paciornik said the Co-Chairs would draft conclusions on this issue.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_16">

    <div id="section_17">
      <h2>RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>After making minor amendments to the Co-Chairs text, the contact group finalized consideration of draft conclusions and a draft decision on this issue.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_18">
      <h2>POLICIES AND MEASURES</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The EU, supported by the US, suggested holding workshops to share information on sector or sub-sector specific activities.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA said information sharing should focus on the adverse effects of P&amp;Ms on developing countries.</p>
      <p>The US, supported by SAMOA, suggested that the Secretariat develop terms of reference (TORs) for future workshops in accordance with decision 13/CP.7 (P&amp;Ms), which refers to adverse effects.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA opposed additional workshops, regardless of their TORs, citing budgetary constraints and the need for 'a total discussion' on the implementation of decision 13/CP.7.</p>
      <p>JAPAN, supported by the EU, suggested further enhancing web-based information exchange.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) said he would prepare draft conclusions for discussion.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_19">
      <h2>CAPACITY BUILDING</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In this contact group, chaired by Dechen Tsering, delegates exchanged views on their expectations and on the process of the comprehensive review of capacity-building activities in developing countries.</p>
      <p>Chair Tsering said she would prepare a draft decision for consideration in the group.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_20">
      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>SBI/SBSTA — corridors</small>
      <p>Expressing concern that their indicative contribution to the UNFCCC budget could rise 'dramatically,' some delegates wondered how to enforce budget discipline.</p>
      <p>Others welcomed a larger budget as an indication that the Secretariat is enhancing its ability to meet the ever-increasing needs of Parties.</p>
      <p>Some observers noted that while there was a legal and procedural justification to separate the work programmes of the UNFCCC and the Protocol, the financial consequences of the separation could constrain the work of the COP/MOP.</p>
