      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE IPCC</h2>
      <small>ipcc â€” history</small>
      <p>The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess scientific, technical and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding the risks associated with human-induced climate change, its potential impacts, and options for adaptation and mitigation.</p>
      <p>The IPCC does not undertake new research, nor does it monitor climate-related data.</p>
      <p>Instead, it conducts assessments of knowledge on the basis of published and peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature.</p>
      <p>The IPCC has three WGs: WGI addresses the physical scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change; WGII addresses the vulnerability of socioeconomic and natural systems to climate change, impacts of climate change and adaptation options; and WGIII addresses options for limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigating climate change.</p>
      <p>Each WG has two co-chairs and six vice-chairs, except WGIII, which, for the Fifth Assessment cycle, has three co-chairs.</p>
      <p>The co-chairs guide the WGs in fulfilling the mandates given to them by the Panel and are assisted in this task by Technical Support Units (TSUs).</p>
      <p>The IPCC also has a Task Force on National GHG Inventories (TFI) to oversee the IPCC National GHG Inventories Programme, which aims to: develop and refine an internationally-agreed methodology and software for the calculation and reporting of national GHG emissions and removals; and encourage the use of this methodology by parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
      <p>The Panel elects its Bureau for the duration of the preparation of an IPCC assessment report.</p>
      <p>The Bureau's role is to assist the IPCC Chair in planning, coordinating and monitoring the IPCC's work.</p>
      <p>The Bureau is composed of climate change experts representing all regions.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Bureau comprises 31 members: the IPCC Chair and Vice-Chairs, the WG Co-Chairs and Vice-Chairs and the TFI Co-Chairs.</p>
      <p>In 2011, the IPCC established an Executive Committee to assist with intersessional work and coordination among the WGs.</p>
      <p>The Committee consists of the IPCC Chair, IPCC Vice-Chairs, WGs and TFI Co-Chairs, and advisory members, including the Head of the Secretariat and the four Heads of the TSUs.</p>
      <p>The IPCC Secretariat is located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is hosted by the WMO.</p>

      <h2>IPCC PRODUCTS:</h2>
      <small>ipcc</small>
      <p>Since its inception, the IPCC has prepared a series of comprehensive assessments, special reports and technical papers that provide scientific information on climate change to the international community and are subject to extensive review by experts and governments.</p>
      <p>The IPCC's First Assessment Report was completed in 1990; the Second Assessment Report in 1995; the Third Assessment Report in 2001; and the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in 2007.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Assessment Reports are structured into three volumes, one for each WG.</p>
      <p>Each volume is comprised of an SPM, a Technical Summary and an underlying assessment report.</p>
      <p>All sections of the reports undergo an intensive review process, which takes place in three stages: a first review by experts; a second review by experts and governments; and a third review by governments.</p>
      <p>Each SPM is approved line by line by the respective WG.</p>
      <p>The Assessment Reports also include a SYR, highlighting the most relevant aspects of the three WG reports, and an SPM of the SYR, which is approved line by line by the Panel.</p>
      <p>In addition to the comprehensive assessments, the IPCC produces special reports, methodology reports and technical papers, focusing on specific issues related to climate change.</p>
      <p>Thus far, special reports include: Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) (2000); Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (2005); Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) (2011); and Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) (2011).</p>
      <p>Technical papers have also been prepared on Climate Change and Biodiversity (2002), and on Climate Change and Water (2008), among others.</p>
      <p>In addition, the IPCC also produces methodology reports or guidelines to assist countries in reporting on GHGs.</p>
      <p>Good Practice Guidance reports were approved by the Panel in 2000 and 2003.</p>
      <p>The Panel approved the latest version of the IPCC Guidelines on National GHG Inventories in 2006.</p>
      <p>The IPCC also adopted the 2013 Supplement to the 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories: Wetlands, and the 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>For its work and efforts 'to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about manmade climate change, and to lay the foundations needed to counteract such change', the IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, jointly with former US Vice-President Al Gore, in December 2007.</p>

      <small>ipcc</small>
      <p>During this session (9-10 April 2008, Budapest, Hungary), the IPCC agreed to prepare the AR5 and to retain the current structure of its WGs.</p>
      <p>In order to enable significant use of new scenarios in AR5, the Panel requested the IPCC Bureau to ensure delivery of the WGI report by early 2013 and completion of the other WG reports and the SYR as early as possible in 2014.</p>
