      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Developing country delegates left the SBI plenary with a mix of jubilation and exhaustion after an unscheduled late night session on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Their delight followed success in finally providing an SBI platform for the implementation issues around technology transfer.</p>
      <p>A procedural dispute over SBI's approach to a COP decision to refer the issue to both the SBSTA and SBI took all Tuesday morning to resolve.</p>
      <p>After a year of informal debate within the G-77/China on how to achieve a breakthrough on technology transfer, some G-77 negotiators commented that one more morning was deemed to be well worth the effort to get a result.</p>
      <p>Others, however, questioned whether the new item might have negative impacts on expected progress on the issue under the SBSTA .</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, some participants were also talking about the fact that the SBI had yet to complete the initial consideration of all its agenda items, a delay which would likely impact the schedule for other groups supposed to meet on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>There's not a lot of room to maneuver if things fall too far behind, warned one delegate.</p>
