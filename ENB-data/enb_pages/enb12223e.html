      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Affected by an apparently smooth second day of meetings, and possibly still disoriented by the labyrinth-like Fiera conference halls, it appeared that some participants were sleepwalking this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The quiet atmosphere may, however, only be the calm before the storm.</p>
      <p>Although the winds outwardly appear to have been blowing favorably for the LULUCF negotiations so far, it remains to be seen how delegates will react when confronted with the many draft decisions that will be developed over the next few days.</p>
