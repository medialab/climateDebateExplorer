      <p>The EU urged a decision that will safeguard the continuity of the submission process and encourage submission cycles.</p>

      <p>Co-Chair Rosland, supported by the EU, CANADA and JAPAN, proposed removing all brackets in the draft negotiating text forwarded from SBSTA-20 and deleting the option on the common reporting format referring to Article 6.</p>
      <p>BRAZIL, for G-77/China, requested time to consider the matter further, but hoped to reach agreement on the issue at COP-10.</p>
      <p>AOSIS, opposed by CANADA and NEW ZEALAND, said SBSTA should request the IPCC to revise 'method one' (units of land subject to multiple activities) in the GPG.</p>

      <p>AOSIS, opposed by CHILE, JAPAN, and PERU, proposed deletion of text stating that projects will be exempt from, or subject to, paying a lower share of proceeds to the Protocol's Adaptation Fund.</p>
      <p>CANADA, with several Parties, and opposed by the EU and AOSIS, supported maintaining reference to reduced rates of the share of project proceeds to cover administrative expenses, noting that costs are the greatest barrier for low income communities.</p>
      <p>Participants agreed to delete text encouraging host Parties to establish measures to facilitate implementation of small-scale A&amp;R.</p>
      <p>Text inviting assistance for capacity-building activities for the application and implementation of simplified modalities and procedures was agreed.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>While the pending entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol demonstrates that progress has indeed been made, Tuesday's discussions showed the re-emergence of past tensions between the COP and the GEF that many thought had subsided.</p>
      <p>Equally stuck in molasses seemed the contact group on adverse effects, where delegates remarked that, with few changes in position since SB-20, significant informal consultations will be needed for a decision to be reached at COP-10.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12251e_3">
      <h2>Provision of financial and technical support</h2>

    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12251e_5">
      <h2>FINANCIAL MECHANISM</h2>
      <p>Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF): The EU said a recent meeting of potential SCCF donors had resulted in pledges of US$35 million.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA said no single activity should be prioritized over others.</p>
      <p>ARGENTINA, with PANAMA, welcomed the pledges to the SCCF, but noted that these are insufficient for effectively supporting adaptation and disaster response.</p>
      <p>AOSIS, supported by the AFRICA GROUP, LDCs, NAMIBIA, CUBA and UGANDA, expressed concern over the interpretation of COP guidance by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), underlining that the most vulnerable countries face difficulty in accessing GEF funds due to the burden of co-financing requirements, the existence of additional criteria and indicators not adopted by the COP, and the narrow scope of adaptation projects eligible under the GEF.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND noted that the new criteria seek to simplify the incremental cost principle and the US welcomed the differentiation in criteria applied to the General Trust Fund and SCCF.</p>
      <p>SAMOA urged that more innovative approaches be used and that the COP, not the GEF, should determine eligibility criteria.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12251e_6">
      <h2>Report of the GEF</h2>
      <p>The GEF described its activities on national communications, capacity building, adaptation, LDCs and the SCCF.</p>
      <p>ARGENTINA voiced concern over the GEF's administrative costs, and, with MAURITIUS and UGANDA, called for transparency on the use of donor funds.</p>
      <p>AOSIS underlined that the GEF must follow the guidance given by the COP. Responding to Parties' comments, the GEF explained that the proportion of co-financing is due to the GEF requirement to fund only incremental costs.</p>
      <p>Regarding administrative costs he said this issue is addressed by the GEF Council. Implementation of decision 5/CP.8 (review of the financial mechanism): JAPAN welcomed the GEF's leverage of substantial co-financing resources.</p>
      <p>The US noted that the GEF finances the incremental costs of implementation, yet many projects presented in national communications do not identify such costs.</p>
      <p>The EU highlighted the importance of identifying funds for the fourth GEF replenishment.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12251e_7">
      <h2>Additional guidance to the GEF</h2>
      <p>JAPAN said the COP should provide guidance to the GEF on project eligibility and criteria, but not on issues related to the GEF's management.</p>
      <p>MICRONESIA emphasized SIDS' difficulties in accessing funds.</p>
      <p>NEW ZEALAND suggested that the GEF should be more flexible and provide support for small-scale projects in SIDS. A contact group, co-chaired by Rawleston Moore (Barbados) and Jozef Buys (Belgium), will address the SCCF, implementation of decision 5/CP.8 and additional guidance to the GEF.</p>
      <p>Chair Stoycheva will prepare draft conclusions on the report of the GEF.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12251e_8">
      <h2>CAPACITY BUILDING</h2>
      <p>Philip Gwage (Uganda) reported on the meeting of capacity-building practitioners held on 3 December 2004 in Buenos Aires.</p>
      <p>JAPAN supported reporting on capacity-building activities through existing UNFCCC instruments, such as national communications.</p>
      <p>TANZANIA, for the G-77/China, identified the need for indicators and a reporting and monitoring procedure.</p>
      <p>The US said all Parties should endeavor to improve their reporting on capacity building.</p>
      <p>Roger Cornforth (New Zealand) and Shirley Moroka (South Africa) will co-chair a contact group.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12251e_9">
      <h2>UNFCCC ARTICLE 6</h2>
      <p>UNEP reported on its contributions to assist Parties in their implementation of Article 6.</p>
      <p>The EU and SWITZERLAND highlighted the merit of an information clearing house.</p>
      <p>The US said the clearing house should be user-friendly, cost-effective and developed through a phased approach.</p>
      <p>Crispin d'Auvergne (Saint Lucia) will chair a contact group on the issue.</p>
