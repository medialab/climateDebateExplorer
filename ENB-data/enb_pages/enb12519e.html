      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>working group — corridors</small>
      <p>On Wednesday, tense standoffs played out in several of the numerous AWG-LCA informal group meetings.</p>
      <p>Delegates singled out review, markets and non-market approaches and finance, in particular.</p>
      <p>It doesn t look like we will ever have any text on long-term finance, remarked one, we may as well pack our bags and leave now.</p>
      <p>Some developing countries claimed that developed countries were reneging on their commitments, with one issuing a stark warning that without finance, there would be no mitigation, adaptation nothing for MRV.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, developed countries reiterated their commitment to providing long-term finance, maintaining, however that the issue has been adequately addressed elsewhere and that there was no mandate to discuss it here.</p>
      <p>On the technology front, the atmosphere seemed more congenial.</p>
      <p>One delegate emerging from the informal group acknowledged slow progress, but added that compared to other groups, the technology group is doing well.</p>
      <p>He said the informal group discussed text on the roles and responsibilities of the CTCN and that governance would be discussed on Thursday, with discussions on the selection criteria for the host to be left for Durban.</p>
      <p>In the afternoon, the informal group on legal options was once again filled to capacity, indicating intense interest on this issue.</p>
      <p>Parties addressed a non-paper, prepared by the facilitator, containing a menu of legal options, which for many was a modest step forward, setting out the possible options for a Durban outcome.</p>
      <p>The text was based on a range of views expressed by parties that included the following options: a legally binding instrument (LBI); and COP decisions, including a sub-option on a mandate to conclude an LBI with a clear roadmap.</p>
      <p>Ensuing discussions were heated.</p>
      <p>Many developed countries acknowledged, while a legally-binding agreement coming out of Durban would be ideal, it is unlikely to happen.</p>
      <p>One developing country expressed that the political conditions were not right to agree to a mandate to conclude an LBI in Durban.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries expressed their disappointment with the turn that discussions were taking in some of the negotiating groups as a whole, with no clear signal of will to sign on to a second commitment period and some of the Bali pillars, such as adaptation and finance, lagging behind on the road to Durban.</p>
      <p>As India put it, In some negotiating groups, we re really splitting hairs.</p>
      <p>The Gambia, for the LDCs, concluded, the ball is in the court of Annex I parties that have made commitments in Bali and Copenhagen.</p>
      <p>If they start backtracking now, how are we ever going to have an agreement?</p>

      <h2>FINANCE:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Discussions in the afternoon informal group centered on long-term finance.</p>
      <p>The proponents of two submissions on long-term finance responded to questions regarding their proposals.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, calling for a focus on textual proposals, many developing countries requested the co-facilitator to consolidate all the proposals from parties on the Standing Committee and long-term finance into a single draft text document for consideration.</p>
      <p>Some developed countries preferred to address long-term finance by further discussing issues, such as climate finance and public versus private finance.</p>
      <p>One developed country party noted that they were willing to engage in a dialogue on long-term finance, but questioned whether the co-facilitators were being given a mandate by the group to consolidate text.</p>
      <p>Informal informal discussions will be held on this issue.</p>

    <div id="section_enb12519e_4">
      <h2>DEVELOPED COUNTRY MITIGATION:</h2>

      <p>Many parties welcomed the text.</p>
      <p>Many developed countries made suggestions related to text on provision of information on LULUCF and projections.</p>
      <p>On a reference to an economy-wide emission reduction target, some developing parties supported removing reference to including any conditions or assumptions relevant to the attainment of that target.</p>
      <p>A party suggested including reference to providing information on the adverse effects of response measures in developing countries.</p>
      <p>Some parties highlighted the open status of the text to ensure that additional comments by parties will be taken on-board in Durban.</p>
      <p>Clarification was requested on when the group would engage in a more serious drafting exercise.</p>
      <p>Parties then considered a non-paper by the co-facilitators on possible elements of modalities and procedures for IAR.Parties provided comments on the text, including on additional options.</p>

      <h2>DEVELOPING COUNTRY NAMAS:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>In the morning informal group, parties addressed a non-paper on possible elements of modalities and procedures for ICA prepared by the facilitator.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries said the text goes beyond the relevant provisions of the Cancun Agreements for biennial update reports and also the guidelines for Non-Annex I parties national communications.</p>
      <p>Some also said the text does not reflect the flexibility provided in the national communications guidelines nor include a section on developing parties national circumstances.</p>
      <p>They noted that the biennial update report is intended to contribute to enhancing transparency and needs to be seen in the context of information provided in national communications and streamlined with national communications guidelines, and not replace them.</p>
      <p>Some developed parties welcomed the text as a means to enhance transparency and the provision of information.</p>
      <p>On principles and definitions, many developing countries said the reference to comparability among parties in the text should be removed, while a developed party suggested including a definition of comparability.</p>
      <p>Many parties also noted that the requirements included in the text are just as onerous as those envisaged in the biennial reports for Annex I parties and do not adhere to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and countries capabilities.</p>
      <p>Some developed countries observed that the text could be a basis for further work and supported retaining the core elements included.</p>
      <p>Many parties said the text should be streamlined, with a developed country highlighting that biennial update reports should not imply new obligations for developing countries.</p>
      <p>Some developed countries supported continuing work on the issue in a spin-off group and others supported the preparation of a revised version of the text based on comments provided.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries supported preparing a new text, not a revision, reflecting discussions and the mandates of the Cancun Agreements.</p>
      <p>A revised new enough version of the text will be prepared.</p>
      <p>Parties then addressed developing country mitigation actions (paragraphs 48-51 of Decision 1/CP.16).</p>
      <p>A non-paper based on parties submissions and discussions will be prepared by the co-facilitators.</p>
