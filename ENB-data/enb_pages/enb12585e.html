      <h2>ADP</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL THE ELEMENTS OF DECISION 1/CP.17 : Opening the third part of ADP 2, Co-Chair Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) highlighted that, by the end of the Warsaw session, half of the ADP's lifetime will have passed.</p>
      <p>He called for a draft negotiating text by December 2014 and a negotiating text by May 2015.</p>
      <p>He drew attention to the Co-Chairs' note on the organization of work (ADP.2013.16.InformalNote) and welcomed parties' submissions.</p>
      <p>He explained that the ADP's work will also be informed by technical papers on adaptation (FCCC/TP/2013/10) and pre-2020 ambition (FCCC/TP/2013/8 and Add.s 1&amp;2).</p>
      <p>On workstream 1 (2015 agreement), Co-Chair Kumarsingh said that parties are now ready to 'shift gears' by moving forward, and not in reverse, and define the content and elements of the 2015 agreement.</p>
      <p>On workstream 2 (pre-2020 ambition), he called for a common understanding of the concrete outcome in Warsaw.</p>
      <p>He explained that open-ended consultations, facilitated by questions from the Co-Chairs, will take place in a plenary setting, expressing hope that this more formal setting will provide for a dynamic, transparent and inclusive exchange.</p>
      <p>The Co-Chairs will also consult with parties on the need for further sessions in 2014, in addition to the three sessions already agreed.</p>

      <p>NEPAL called for capitalizing the GCF and ensuring all features of NAMAs are enabled through support to developing countries.</p>
      <p>The EU suggested looking at existing institutions on adaptation, mitigation, finance and technology, to assess adequacy or identify gaps to be filled to deliver on core elements of the 2015 agreement.</p>
      <p>Underscoring a financial mechanism without adequate resources and certainty as a structural problem, ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA recommended that any future financial mechanism be under the Convention so that it is subject to review.</p>
      <p>She cautioned against reversing the polluter pays principle through loans from developed countries to developing countries for adaptation and mitigation. PAPUA NEW GUINEA called for clarifying what constitutes climate finance, expressing concern that significant amounts are channeled to the private sector or fall under official development assistance.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Warsaw National Stadium swarmed as delegates buzzed around the halls in what one delegate called 'one of the busiest days in the history of the UNFCCC process'.</p>
      <p>The day's packed agenda included a number of informal groups on market mechanisms, including those on Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation reform, non-market approaches and the new market mechanism.</p>
      <p>Multiple meetings did not seem to yield much common ground.</p>
      <p>While some seemed keen to complement the familiar Kyoto mechanisms with new ones, others pointedly asked 'why establish new mechanisms - where will the demand come from?</p>
      <p>' Some also continued to question the fundamental need for market mechanisms, stressing the need for robust domestic mitigation measures instead.</p>
      <p>The only agreement emerging was that concrete results, especially regarding new mechanisms, will take time.</p>
      <p>Delegates continued to be moved by the plight of those affected by typhoon Haiyan.</p>
      <p>In the contact group on loss and damage, references to the damage in her country moved a Philippine delegate to tears.</p>
      <p>Throughout the day, red circles appeared on some participants' lapels to show solidarity with Naderev Saño, the Climate Change Commissioner from the Philippines, and join his voluntary fast.</p>
      <p>One delegate explained that this show of support extends beyond the growing number of civil society representatives and even the halls of the UNFCCC conference venue, as individuals from around the world are pledging to fast in the hope of a meaningful outcome at COP 19.</p>
