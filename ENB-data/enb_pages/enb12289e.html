      <h2>OPENING OF THE MEETING</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 President Stéphane Dion outlined progress on what he referred to as the 'three Is' of 'implementation, improvement, and innovation.</p>
      <p>' On implementation, he highlighted adoption of the Marrakesh Accords and the compliance mechanism, while on improvement he cited initiatives on adaptation and the CDM.</p>
      <p>On innovation, he said this conference must demonstrate a strong commitment to Protocol Article 3.9, but that action under Article 3.9 is only part of the solution. Louise Fréchette, UN Deputy Secretary-General, said all industrialized countries need to intensify their efforts, thus paving the way for action in the developing world.</p>
      <p>She observed that the right mix of polices and incentives can galvanize green technologies and change corporate and consumer habits. Richard Kinley, UNFCCC Acting Executive Secretary, underscored the need to increase financial support for developing countries, particularly LDCs.</p>
      <p>He highlighted renewed momentum in the process in 2005 and said this meeting was an opportunity to push forward. Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, said developing countries will suffer the most from climate change and urged developed countries to meet their responsibilities.</p>
      <p>Stressing that the time for complacency is over and inaction is not an option, he underscored that climate change is a global challenge that needs a global response.</p>

      <h2>REPORT OF THE CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>After informal consultations, delegates agreed to forward a Co-Chairs draft decision to COP/MOP 1.</p>
      <p>The text covers efficient functioning of the CDM, including responsiveness to the needs of Parties and stakeholders; and presenting the Boards decisions along with appropriate explanations.</p>
      <p>The draft decision defines the details of retroactive crediting, requests the Board to call for public input on additionality, and includes a differentiated share of proceeds to cover the Boards administrative expenses.</p>
      <p>Parties also decided to provide guidance on carbon dioxide capture and storage projects at COP/MOP 2, and that policies or standards cannot be considered CDM projects, but that projects under a programme of activities can be registered as a single CDM project.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_14">
      <h2>COMPLIANCE</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Following informal consultations, Co-Chair Mamadou Honadia introduced a draft decision stating that Parties 'approve and adopt' the compliance mechanism as contained in Decision 24/CP.7.</p>
      <p>The text adds that consideration of an amendment to the Protocol will commence at SBI 24 with a view to making a decision at COP/MOP 3.</p>
      <p>Parties raised no objections and decided to forward it to COP/MOP 1 for adoption.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_15">
      <h2>PROTOCOL ARTICLE 3.9</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Informal consultations continued on future commitments under Protocol Article 3.9.</p>
      <p>Delegates agreed not to discuss Article 9 (review of the Protocol) in this group until Article 3.9 is dealt with.</p>
      <p>The discussion then focused on whether to proceed with an ad hoc open-ended working group or workshops.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_16">
      <h2>FUTURE ACTIONS UNDER THE UNFCCC</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Discussions continued in a roundtable discussion on future actions under the Convention based on a proposal by President Dion (FCCC/CP/2005/CRP.1).</p>
      <p>Further consultations and a revised text are expected on Thursday morning.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_17">
      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Many negotiators breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday as work on compliance and the CDM was completed two days before the end of the meeting.</p>
      <p>As one negotiator said, this now leaves time for discussing 'the really important stuff' - a clear reference to future actions.</p>
      <p>Opinions on this issue seem split among those favoring an approach under Protocol Article 3.9 on future commitments, those leaning towards an approach under the Convention, and those who seem comfortable with a 'twin-track approach.</p>
      <p>' Australias apparent sympathy for Dions initiative also drew some comments from those who saw it as a contrasting approach to that of the US.</p>
      <p>There was also increasing talk about discussions under Protocol Article 9, which refers to a review of the Protocol by COP/MOP 2. As rumors swirled about progress - or lack thereof - in the various informal discussions, several participants were heard welcoming the involvement of former UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar.</p>
      <p>'The more sensible heads around now, the better,' said one veteran of the process.</p>
