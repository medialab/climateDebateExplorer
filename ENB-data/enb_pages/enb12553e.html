      <h2>CONTACT GROUP:</h2>
      <small>working group — groups</small>
      <p>In the afternoon, delegates heard reports by the facilitators of spin-off groups on progress achieved in the negotiations.</p>
      <p>On a shared vision, AWG-LCA Chair Aysar Tayeb, on behalf of facilitator Zou Ji, reported divergence on whether the context or the numbers for a global goal and peaking timeframe should be addressed first.</p>
      <p>He said parties have not yet discussed which body will undertake this issue after the closure of the AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>On developed country mitigation, facilitator Andrej Kranjc reported a useful exchange on substantive issues and on the way forward, adding that parties agreed on the need to further engage in discussions on clarification of targets and approaches for measuring progress.</p>
      <p>On developing country mitigation, facilitator Gary Theseira reported that the spin-off group considered a note on elements which could become part of an outcome in Doha, saying elements identified by parties included: reiterating calls for NAMAs and enhanced provision of support; further discussions on understanding the diversity of NAMAs; development of guidelines for MRV of support; and proposals for building the capacity of countries to prepare and implement NAMAs, such as through regional workshops, guidelines and handbooks.</p>
      <p>On REDD+ financing, facilitator Yaw Osafo reported the group discussions built on the in-session workshop on REDD+, and focused on, inter alia : guiding principles; enabling conditions necessary for scaling-up and facilitating financing; issues that require further exploration; and signals required from Doha to incentivize financing for the full implementation of REDD+.</p>
      <p>He reported rich exchanges on the institutional arrangements required, including the establishment of a REDD+ board, registries, insurance or reserve mechanism, review and regulatory bodies.</p>
      <p>He said an updated informal note would be prepared for parties consideration.</p>
      <p>On sectoral approaches, facilitator George Wamukaya reported that parties exchanged views on four options on the general framework, and that diverging views remain.</p>
      <p>On bunker fuels, he reported discussions addressed five options that will continue to narrow them down.</p>
      <p>On various approaches, facilitator Alexa Kleysteuber reported that the group discussions were based on an informal note containing a map of elements that need to be addressed.</p>
      <p>On a framework for various approaches, she said parties exchanged views on purposes and roles.</p>
      <p>On a NMM she underscored productive exchanges on modalities and procedures. AWG-LCA Chair Tayeb reported on the progress of issues addressed under the AWG-LCA contact group.</p>
      <p>On response measures, he reported different views on whether decision text should be prepared for Doha and which body should consider the issue of unilateral measures.</p>
      <p>On adaptation, he indicated that parties identified issues requiring further work on, inter alia : means of implementation for adaptation; financing for 2013-2015; linkages with finance; national adaptation plans for non-LDCs; and the catalytic role of the Convention.</p>
      <p>He said divergent views remain on whether the AWG-LCA should further address these issues and if additional decisions are required.</p>
      <p>On technology, he said parties identified pending issues, such as: the relationship between the CTCN and the TEC; possible additional functions for both bodies; and IPRs.</p>
      <p>He reported agreement on the need to further consider these issues but disagreements on how and when to do it.</p>
      <p>On finance, he reported that discussions focused on, inter alia , the financing period between 2012 and 2020, fast-start finance and MRV of financial support.</p>
      <p>He said disagreement remains on whether further decisions under the AWG-LCA are necessary, and on how and where finance issues could be further considered.</p>
      <p>On capacity building, he said views diverge on where and how to address outstanding issues and on whether the AWG-LCA should provide further guidance.</p>
      <p>On Review, facilitator Gertraud Wollansky reported that two options on the scope of the Review are on the table, one based on Decision 1/CP.16 para 138 (Review) and the other further defining the scope to include the assessment of the implementation of commitments under the Convention, including means of implementation provided to developing countries.</p>
      <p>On expert consideration of inputs, he underscored two options under discussion: a review expert group to be established in Doha; and a joint contact group of SBSTA and SBI.</p>
      <p>On EIT and countries whose special circumstances have been recognized by the COP, he reported ongoing consultations held by the AWG-LCA Vice-Chair. AWG-LCA Chair Tayeb concluded that progress in the Bangkok negotiations had been limited, saying divergent views remain on whether further work on the issues is needed beyond Doha and what body would be suited for addressing them. SWITZERLAND, on behalf of the EIG, cautioned parties not to change the focus and character of the contact group, called for focusing energies on discussions in the spin-off groups and said topics for discussion in the spin-off group should complement the agreed outcome under the AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>He highlighted achievements under the AWG-LCA, including mitigation pledges from 87 countries, and renewed focus on adaptation, technology and finance.</p>
      <p>Australia, on behalf of the UMBRELLA GROUP, said that building permanent homes for finance, technology and capacity building has been no small feat, and emphasized that this work will continue through the new established mechanisms.</p>
      <p>The PHILIPPINES urged parties to consider where progress has and has not been made on implementing BAP, highlighting that the AWG-LCA s work is not complete.</p>
      <p>She underscored the importance of providing means of implementation, in order for developing countries to meet their obligations under the Convention.</p>
      <p>The EU highlighted the need to build a better technical understanding of the scale of the implementation gap, calling for clarification of pledges, and progress on REDD+ finance and bunker fuels. COLOMBIA said the BAP had set up a long-term horizon, and does not have a definite end point.</p>
      <p>She recommended exploring a transition into a post-AWG-LCA scenario.</p>
      <p>Kenya, for the AFRICAN GROUP, called for a process to take forward technical issues, saying a very comprehensive decision on this will be needed in Doha. INDIA recommended identifying the technical and political issues that may not be completed in Doha, including a timeframe for peaking of emissions, and issues of long-term finance and trade-related IPRs, in order to determine how to take forward that work.</p>
      <p>He noted that successful closure of the AWG-LCA was a key part of the Durban decision. SOUTH AFRICA noted lack of clarity on key elements, such as comparability, finance, technology and adaptation.</p>
      <p>He said the institutions established in Cancun and Durban were not the right platform to discuss commitments under the Convention, and urged engaging on substantive discussion on these issues to bring them to a logical conclusion in Doha. SINGAPORE said the updates provide a sobering reality of what is happening in the AWG-LCA, and that we have crystallized our divergences, but have not made much progress towards convergence.</p>
      <p>He said a decision was needed for closure of the AWG-LCA in Doha.</p>
      <p>The US said that a decision to close the AWG-LCA is not needed, but that a formal decision would be required to extend it. SAUDI ARABIA said convergence must be reached on areas where there is disagreement and that innovative ways to address them must be found or they will keep coming back in the future.</p>
      <p>In closing, AWG-LCA Chair Tayeb said that closing an agenda item does not mean discussion on that issue ends or that work cannot continue, and that everyone wants to close the work of the AWG-LCA.</p>

      <h2>CONTACT GROUP:</h2>
      <small>working group — groups</small>
      <p>In the afternoon, AWG-KP Chair Diouf convened a stocktaking meeting.</p>
      <p>Jürgen Lefevere, co-facilitator of the spin-off group on numbers/text reported that while there seemed to be a common goal on raising the level of ambition, divergent views remained on how and when.</p>
      <p>On informal consultations on a second commitment period, AWG-KP Vice-Chair Jukka Uosukainen noted increased clarity on the elements needed to address the gap between commitment periods in Doha, emphasizing that now is the time for parties to enrich and build textual proposals on these elements.</p>
      <p>The EU requested text emerging from Bangkok in order to ensure a clear mandate from capitals for Doha .</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA said the review should include all parties and over-achievement should not be penalized in the carry-over limitations.</p>
      <p>Saint Lucia, for AOSIS, registered deep concern over the lack of ambition, saying that the consequences of a 3°C world had not been fully appreciated.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND said that the carry-over issue should be approached from a comprehensive perspective and that the alternative to the CDM is the Wild West of disparate carbon markets.</p>
      <p>The EU, NEW ZEALAND, SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA underscored the importance of maintaining demand for CDM credits.</p>
      <p>The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said that parties that do not join a second commitment period should not be isolated, in order to ensure easy transition into the post-2020 legal regime.</p>
      <p>South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, and AOSIS said that only parties to a second commitment period should have access to the flexible mechanisms.</p>
      <p>NEW ZEALAND said access to CDM per se is not an enticement for countries to join the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>SENEGAL, for LDCs, noted that without movement on the Kyoto track, other tracks cannot move significantly.</p>
      <p>The MARSHALL ISLANDS said that his position on a five-year commitment period is driven by mitigation ambition and not symmetry between the negotiation tracks.</p>
      <p>He expressed concern over voluntary processes with respect to increasing mitigation ambition.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>working group — corridors</small>
      <p>On the ADP, some felt that Sunday s informal consultations with the Co-Chairs were useful and productive.</p>
      <p>The tough part will be on Wednesday when we start considering how to have more structured discussions in Doha, said one delegate who was privy to the informal discussions.</p>
      <p>He wondered whether the question of the workplan for 2013 will get some flesh on the bones, suggesting that a series of workshops could be the appropriate way forward.</p>
      <p>However, another said, sighing, Some delegates are just not ready to negotiate so they are stalling.</p>
      <p>Personally, I am still very unclear as to the purpose of this meeting here in Bangkok.</p>
      <p>The Qatari President Designate of COP 18/CMP 8 convened well-attended, open-ended informal consultations on the expectations of Parties and observers in the morning, followed by a greeting meeting.</p>
      <p>While the opening plenaries earlier in the meeting focused on each AWG separately, these open-ended consultations provided participants with an opportunity to link their expectations for all the AWGs, in a mutually-supportive manner.</p>
      <p>After listening to the briefing by the incoming COP Presidency and the interventions by parties, a couple of observers were caught speculating whether some Arab states might soon be submitting NAMAs.</p>
      <p>Some are definitely ready to take that step, and are only waiting for higher political support within their countries, predicted one hopeful observer.</p>
