      <p>JAPAN called for practical solutions based on market trends and demand.</p>
      <p>With the EU, JAPAN suggested exploring solutions that would provide incentives for mitigation but not for increased production.</p>

      <h2>PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES:</h2>

    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12300e_16">

      <p>SBI Chair Becker introduced this item (FCCC/SBI/2005/10 annex I).</p>
      <p>The PHILIPPINES said the SCCF was to address urgent needs of developing countries since the operating entity of the financial mechanism cannot adequately do so. COLOMBIA said that SCCF must consist of new and additional funding rather than have ODA channeled through it.</p>
      <p>The EU stated that activities under the SCCF and Adaptation Fund should not overlap.</p>

      <h2>SPECIAL REPORT RELATING TO HFCs AND PFCs</h2>
      <p>In informal consultations, several industrialized countries said further consideration of this issue was not necessary, as the Special Report provided parties with the guidance they need to act domestically.</p>
      <p>However, another group of developed countries highlighted the need for further coordination and consideration at the international level.</p>
      <p>Draft conclusions will be prepared.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12300e_22">
      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Many participants seemed to be suffering from meeting fatigue on Friday, with delegates talking about ennui or an enthusiasm deficit.</p>
      <p>Some blamed the fact that they are in their fourth week of meetings, following the recent IPCC and CSD sessions.</p>
      <p>Other suggested that this was due to the fact that the process for deciding on long-term, post-2012 issues has just begun, with a long road ahead before any key decisions are likely.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, several delegates noted that perennial issues on the SB agenda seemed to be going nowhere.</p>
      <p>Having returned to the process after several years, it is strange to note that the conversations on some issues are exactly the same, observed one delegate.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12300e_3">
      <h2>COP 12 and COP/MOP 2</h2>
      <p>Richard Kinley, UNFCCC Officer-in-Charge, briefed delegates on arrangements for COP 12 and COP/MOP 2 (FCCC/SBI/2006/2), highlighting the huge challenge of holding the COP, COP/MOP, SBI, SBSTA, AWG, UNFCCC Dialogue, and contact groups within a two-week period.</p>
      <p>Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, supported by the EU and SWITZERLAND, said the meeting should not extend beyond two weeks, and advocated issue prioritization.</p>
      <p>SOUTH AFRICA urged finding the most effective approach, and said extending the session by two days would not be harmful.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12300e_4">
      <h2>Review of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1</h2>
      <p>Richard Kinley noted questions about the participation of observers in the COP/MOP.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA noted its submission asserting serious inaccuracies in the Secretariat's Note (FCCC/SBI/2006/2, paragraphs 32-33).</p>
      <p>The US said the status of parties to the UNFCCC but not the Protocol was clear under Protocol Articles 13.2 and 15.2.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12300e_5">
      <h2>Organization of the intergovernmental process</h2>
      <p>Richard Kinley noted recent discussions on how to manage complicated agendas, multiplicity of contact groups, and exhaustion of delegates.</p>

      <p>A contact group on these issues will be co-chaired by Sandea de Wet (South Africa) and Aloisia Wörgetter (Austria).</p>
    </div>

      <h2>ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS:</h2>
      <p>The Secretariat introduced a synthesis of reports on demonstrable progress by Annex I countries in achieving their Kyoto targets (FCCC/SBI/2006/INF.2).</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA emphasized that Annex I countries are failing to honour their Kyoto obligations and proposed referring the issue to the compliance committee.</p>
      <p>The EU, JAPAN and others emphasized their commitment to the Kyoto targets and NEW ZEALAND proposed considering the issue at SB 25 to include the missing progress reports.</p>
      <p>Dimitrios Lalas (Greece) will chair informal consultations.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12300e_7">
      <h2>ADAPTATION FUND:</h2>

      <p>BARBADOS and TUVALU called for special consideration of SIDS in the management of the Fund.</p>
      <p>The EU, COLOMBIA and SWITZERLAND supported the GEF as the operating entity of the Fund.</p>
      <p>With support from many developing countries, COLOMBIA added that the Fund should be managed independently and have flexible operational policies.</p>
      <p>INDONESIA said technical assistance should be eligible for funding.</p>
      <p>Levaggi and Sach will co-chair a contact group.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>POLICIES AND MEASURES:</h2>
      <p>On Annex I parties  policies and measures, the EU, SAUDI ARABIA, BELARUS and others, opposed by the US and JAPAN, supported further consideration of this issue by SBSTA.</p>

      <p>SAUDI ARABIA, supported by CHINA and EGYPT, insisted on a contact group, while the EU and JAPAN objected.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12300e_9">

      <p>The EU and SWITZERLAND stressed enhanced cooperation between UNFCCC, CBD and UNCCD, while the US and CHINA noted the distinct nature of the three Rio conventions.</p>
