      <h2>Second Commitment Period</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Parties continued to discuss options for ensuring continuity between the first and second commitment periods.</p>
      <p>Several parties reiterated concerns that provisional application of an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol may not be operationalized quickly enough to address the gap and therefore give the Protocol a solid legal footing.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>working group â€” corridors</small>
      <p>On Saturday, the ADP roundtables on the workstreams concluded.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in the AWG-LCA contact group and informal groups, delegates continued to hit walls.</p>
      <p>The aim of the AWG-LCA here in Bangkok was to put text on pieces of paper for Doha as one delegate put it.</p>
      <p>But even getting text on pieces of paper seems to be a difficult task.</p>
      <p>Durban clearly only mandated further work on specific issues, and we cannot accept text or decisions in Doha on any other issues, said one developed country representative.</p>
      <p>The other issues were already allocated for consideration by the Subsidiary Bodies or the institutions created in Cancun and Durban, he added.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, developing countries have identified numerous unresolved issues under the Bali Action Plan that must be addressed in the AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>Decisions on these issues are necessary for the AWG-LCA to successfully terminate in Doha.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, what becomes of them?</p>
      <p>We can t just leave them hanging and right now the ADP is a vacuum so we can t assume they will be picked up there, one delegate stated.</p>
      <p>With these two divergent views, some were hoping a middle ground could be found.</p>
      <p>We can t have a dictionary of outstanding issues, but we also can t have nothing at all, expressed one who was sitting in the AWG-LCA discussions.</p>
