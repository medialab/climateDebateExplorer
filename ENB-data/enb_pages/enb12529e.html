    </div>

      <p>Parties agreed to hold further informal discussions on Saturday evening.</p>

    <div id="section_16">
      <h2>GREEN CLIMATE FUND (COP)</h2>
      <small>COP â€” groups</small>
      <p>COP President Nkoana-Mashabane presided over open-ended informal consultations, asking parties to present not just concerns but solutions. JAPAN acknowledged concerns over the Fund s legal personality and ambiguity in the relationship between the Fund and the Convention, but said the newly-established Board could address these concerns. EGYPT, INDIA, NAMIBIA and the LDCs said the Fund should have full juridical personality to ensure direct access.</p>
      <p>Along with KENYA, SAUDI ARABIA and the SUDAN, they also stressed the importance of ensuring the GCF s accountability to the COP. FIJI said the GCF is needed immediately and called for complementarity with other funding instruments and institutions.</p>
      <p>NIGERIA, TANZANIA and ZAMBIA warned against overreliance on the private sector.</p>
      <p>The EU recognized concerns, but said he was confident the COP would be able to agree on the draft instrument and that parties should focus on interim arrangements to get things off the ground.</p>
      <p>He stressed that the Board should begin its work as soon as possible. NIGERIA identified a strategic imbalance in the negotiations, with mitigation discussions far ahead of those on adaptation.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND said EITs should have access to the Fund. ADAPTATION FUND BOARD (COP/MOP): Parties considered draft decision text on the report of the Adaptation Fund Board and agreed to provide final written comments by Monday.</p>

      <h2>AWG-LCA STOCKTAKING:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>On Saturday morning, AWG-LCA Chair Daniel Reifsnyder introduced an amalgamation document of draft texts in preparation of a comprehensive and balanced outcome to be presented to COP 17 (FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/CRP.37 and Add.1).</p>
      <p>He said it contained draft text resulting from the work of the informal groups and was intended to provide a snapshot for parties to identify gaps, and opportunities for streamlining.</p>
      <p>He explained that information on technical aspects, including on biennial reports, biennial update reports, IAR and ICA, were also incorporated in an annex.</p>
      <p>On shared vision, Chair Reifsnyder noted the lack of significant progress.</p>
      <p>On developed country mitigation, he said the text reflects progress made on the biennial reports and ICA, and that the amalgamation text contains draft decisions that reflect a fairly mature stage of issues.</p>
      <p>On developing country mitigation, he said the text reflects progress made on biennial update reports and ICA.</p>
      <p>On REDD+ finance, he described a significant and very helpful advance.</p>
      <p>On sectoral approaches, Chair Reifsnyder said parties are expected to keep working towards streamlining text on international aviation and shipping.</p>
      <p>On response measures, he said no common text has been reached and six proposals from parties have been submitted.</p>
      <p>On legal options, he said that the options discussed by parties were included in a text developed under the facilitator s responsibility, and therefore it is not considered a negotiating text. BOLIVIA expressed concerns with the continuation of markets for parties not subscribing to targets under a second commitment period.</p>
      <p>He stressed the need for discussing intellectual property rights in the context of the Technology Committee.</p>
      <p>The US said that text on Chapter 2a and 2b (nationally appropriate mitigation commitments or actions by developed and developing countries) needs to reflect parties views.</p>
      <p>Suggesting that the text is a good start, SAUDI ARABIA called for further work to be conducted in a party-driven process and for progress on response measures, as one of the main elements of the Bali Action Plan and as part of a complete package.</p>
      <p>ECUADOR proposed splitting the text into several different COP decisions addressing each of the BAP pillars. ANNEX I EMISSION REDUCTIONS (AWG-KP): In the spin-off group on numbers, one developing country submitted a draft text on surplus and carryover of AAUs, which was discussed by delegates.</p>
      <p>The co-facilitators then distributed an overview chart of options on the table, which delegates also discussed. LULUCF (AWG-KP): In afternoon informal consultations, delegates discussed a revised non-paper by the co-facilitators.</p>
      <p>On definitions, a party discussed his proposal on a definition on forests, noting that this would introduce a comprehensive vision of forests as systems of life that have multiple functions.</p>
      <p>One party noted that changing the definition of forests for a second commitment period could bring difficulties in terms of implementation and accounting.</p>
      <p>A group of countries presented their revised baseline proposal to account for forest management.</p>
      <p>Parties will continue working on the text until Monday and any additions will be integrated in a new revised version of the non-paper.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_18">
      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Reflecting on the first week in Durban, some delegates pointed to a less frenzied atmosphere than the highly-charged Copenhagen COP or the more positive but logistically-challenged Cancun COP.</p>
      <p>That said, there was some excitement in Durban on Saturday, with thousands of protesters marching outside, while inside delegates worked feverishly on a multitude of texts.</p>
      <p>SBI and SBSTA plenaries met and concluded their work, although they forwarded several issues to the COP.</p>
      <p>With more than 130 pages of AWG-LCA text to review and revise, negotiators left the conference center late Saturday night with plenty of homework for Sunday and early Monday.</p>
      <p>Large sections of the text have been under discussion since Panama.</p>
      <p>However, parties will need to do more work on level of ambition, market mechanisms and long-term financing, among others, if they are to get to a party-driven, balanced and equitable outcome.</p>
      <p>Under the AWG-KP, three options on the form and limit of a second Kyoto commitment period were emerging, though participants noted that no consensus had yet emerged.</p>
      <p>As expected, the COP Presidency quietly moved the indaba sessions among the parties behind closed doors to encourage frank conversations.</p>
      <p>Some delegations were suggesting that subtle changes could be detected and that, rather than simply making demands, parties were starting to seek mutual reassurances that divides could be bridged.</p>
      <p>The dynamics within the BASIC group were still unclear to some, as was the broader response to the EU s proposal for how a package deal might emerge and its desire for a timetable towards a broader agreement.</p>
      <p>As participants discussed how a package might take shape, many noted that the future of the Kyoto Protocol and its mechanisms are at the heart of the matter, along with operationalizing the Green Climate Fund and the other elements of the Cancun Agreements.</p>
      <p>Another major question being asked in Durban is whether the AWG-LCA will finish its work four years after it was created.</p>
      <p>Many felt it may need more time.</p>
      <p>The complexity of knitting these elements into a coherent and acceptable Durban outcome with just one week remaining has many participants worried.</p>
      <p>We see good progress on some technical issues, but the geopolitics are difficult and it is just not clear that all the trade-offs can be reconciled, said one delegate.</p>
      <p>As negotiations resume on Monday, there will be a push to complete agreement on a further round of issues and to sharpen options for ministers when they step in on Tuesday.</p>
