      <h2>GREEN CLIMATE FUND (COP)</h2>
      <small>COP â€” groups</small>
      <p>COP President Nkoana-Mashabane invited parties to consider the report of the Transitional Committee and exchange views on how to take forward the work of the Committee, focusing on solutions.</p>
      <p>NICARAGUA, with BOLIVIA, ECUADOR and VENEZUELA, said the Fund should have full juridical personality and legal capacity.</p>
      <p>COLOMBIA, also speaking for Chile and Costa Rica, said international legal personality was sufficiently provided for in the governing instrument.</p>
      <p>NICARAGUA said the GCF should be accountable to the COP in a real and operational sense.</p>
      <p>BOLIVIA called for an open bidding process for selecting the trustee. AUSTRALIA said she could agree to the governing instrument as part of a balanced package observing that it sets out many innovative and ambitious facilities such as direct access and a private sector facility.</p>
      <p>She called for deciding on next steps, including: establishing the Board; determining the date and place for the first Board meeting; and elaborating a process to establish interim secretariat support for the Board.</p>
      <p>Barbados, for AOSIS, said the COP decision should focus on parameters and timelines for the phase after Durban, including nominations and Board composition.</p>
      <p>He said selecting the host country is a priority.</p>
      <p>The US said the governing instrument should be approved in Durban.</p>
      <p>He also proposed lifting restrictions on who can contribute to the Fund.</p>
      <p>On the interim secretariat, he said it was not credible to assign this function to a technical secretariat lacking financial management expertise.</p>
      <p>On long-term finance, NICARAGUA said there was no concrete roadmap for mobilizing the US$100 billon pledged by 2020, and expressed concern that this sum has no relationship to the GCF.</p>
      <p>The US said the GCF would be a channel for part of the US$100 billion. CDM (COP/MOP): Consultations began on draft texts.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA supported the text.</p>
      <p>ECUADOR, supported by VENEZUELA, BOLIVIA, and BANGLADESH sought to refine the text on CDM operating after the first commitment period to be contingent on parties taking commitments under a second commitment period.</p>
      <p>The group will meet again on Monday. COMPLIANCE (COP/MOP): On compliance, parties agreed to two draft decisions for both agenda items which will be forwarded to the CMP for further consideration and adoption.</p>

      <h2>AWG-KP STOCKTAKING:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>AWG-KP Chair Adrian Macey briefed delegates on discussions.</p>
      <p>He detected common ground on several key issues, such as the use of QELROs, the need to avoid a gap in commitment periods, and ambition.</p>
      <p>In the likely event that a fully-ratified amendment to the Protocol does not exist by the end of the first commitment period, he identified various alternatives, including: a provisional application; a two-stage process that involves a decision and a package of amendments; a decision-only outcome; or a unilateral declaration by certain parties.</p>
      <p>However, he noted that there is no consensus on any of these.</p>
      <p>Chair Macey also explained that there had been no middle ground found yet on share of proceeds, new market mechanisms, eligibility for parties not committing to a second commitment period, supplementarity and nuclear in the CDM.</p>
      <p>Reporting on discussions in the spin-off group on amendments/numbers, Co-Facilitator Leon Charles noted discussions on various issues, including QELROS and length of the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>He detected possible signs of movement on the carryover of AAUs.</p>
      <p>On LULUCF, Co-Facilitator Peter Iversen (Denmark) noted that although many brackets remain in the text, options would be incorporated into a non-paper.</p>
      <p>Brazil, for the G-77/CHINA, supported a fully ratifiable amendment to Annex B with full commitments expressed as QELROs in simple numbers.</p>
      <p>The contact group will reconvene on Monday. ANNEX I EMISSION REDUCTIONS (AWG-KP): In the spin-off group on numbers, delegates discussed a submission by the EU to the Chair s negotiating text (FCCC/KP/AWG/2011/CRP.2/Rev.1).</p>
      <p>Many countries expressed concerns that the option to increase levels of ambition was not strong enough. LULUCF (AWG-KP): Delegates considered a non-paper by the co-facilitators, including parties recent submissions.</p>
      <p>Co-Facilitator Rocha called for parties to work on removing/deleting options.</p>
      <p>One party questioned the participation of parties that had indicated that they would not be part of a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, and expressed concern about parties working under the assumption that LULUCF rules could be transferred to the AWG-LCA track, noting the different nature of commitments.</p>
      <p>He noted that LULUCF rules would depend on QELROs adopted and questioned how to deal with the fact that many parties said they are not ready to adopt QELROs.</p>
      <p>One party said the LULUCF package could provide enough environmental integrity.</p>
      <p>Parties continued working on the text late into the evening. DEVELOPED COUNTRY MITIGATION (AWG-LCA): In evening informal consultations, delegates received revised versions of non-papers on IAR and biennial reports.</p>
      <p>Delegates exchanged views on the way forward and agreed to continue consideration of these issues on Saturday, with a view to prepare input for the amalgamation document. DEVELOPING COUNTRY MITIGATION (AWG-LCA): In evening informal consultations, delegates received revised versions of non-papers on the Registry, elements for guidelines for biennial update reports and ICA.</p>
      <p>Delegates agreed to continue consideration of these issues on Saturday. FINANCE (AWG-LCA): Parties considered revised text on long-term finance, including an annexed indicative schedule of activities on sources of long-term financing.</p>
      <p>Proposals were made for streamlining the text, with several parties cautioning against going backwards on what was agreed in Cancun.</p>
      <p>On capitalization of the GCF, some parties emphasized the need to clarify what was pledged in terms of long-term financing.</p>
      <p>Others said issues relating to the GCF were being considered elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Parties also exchanged views on the feasibility of convening workshops on sources of long-term finance.</p>
      <p>Revised text will be prepared, incorporating inputs from parties. SECTORAL APPROACHES (AWG-LCA): Parties considered the facilitator s note from Panama and several other relevant documents with the aim of developing outcome text.</p>
      <p>Some developing countries insisted that language for a general framework be developed before addressing specific sectors.</p>
      <p>On agriculture, parties considered food security, trade, and economic development and poverty eradication.</p>
      <p>Some developed countries emphasized the relevance of a SBSTA programme of work on agriculture.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to consider a consolidated text of options for the general framework and agriculture.</p>
      <p>On bunker fuels, divergent views were expressed on, inter alia : the scope of measures; principles and directed guidance for the work of ICAO and IMO; ambition of action; and market-based instruments.</p>
      <p>However, there was broad agreement on defining a role for ICAO and IMO to regulate GHG emissions from international aviation and maritime transport, respectively.</p>
      <p>Discussions continued into Friday evening.</p>

      <h2>REDD+ (SBSTA)</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In morning informal consultations, delegates addressed a revised non-paper paragraph-by-paragraph.</p>
      <p>Some developing countries highlighted the necessity to recognize the need for adequate and predictable financial and technology support.</p>
      <p>Another developing country said support should be for all REDD+ elements, rather than just capacity building.</p>
      <p>Delegates then addressed text on the system for providing information on safeguards and forest reference levels and/or forest emission reference levels.</p>
      <p>Delegates continued negotiations into the evening. LOSS AND DAMAGE (SBI): On Friday morning, Chair Owen-Jones distributed a new draft text that included a new annex based on proposals by the US, AOSIS and Indonesia.</p>
      <p>Parties considered the main text and made proposals on language.</p>
      <p>Several parties welcomed the new text as a good basis for further work, but cautioned against getting too specific on sectors.</p>
      <p>On the form of the outcome, the US said she was not convinced that it should take the form of a COP decision at this stage.</p>
      <p>Bolivia, for the G-77/CHINA, supported a COP decision, as it would mark a clear path towards a stronger outcome at the next COP.</p>
      <p>Regarding text on approaches to loss and damage, NORWAY, supported by the COOK ISLANDS, said slow onset events should be included, without mentioning sectoral specifics.</p>
      <p>In the afternoon, delegates considered a proposal by AOSIS on an international mechanism to address loss and damage.</p>
      <p>This was supported by the LDCs, SICA and several non-Annex I parties.</p>
      <p>The US, supported by the EU, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, SWITZERLAND, NORWAY and JAPAN, said she was not in a position to work towards the establishment of an international mechanism and would like to consider a range of approaches.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND said options must be explored before the ambition for COP 18 is stated.</p>
      <p>KENYA stressed the need to create linkages with the GCF.</p>
      <p>Delegates will consider a revised draft text on Saturday morning. NATIONAL ADAPTATION PLANS (SBI): Delegates discussed and revised draft text throughout the day in an informal group.</p>
      <p>A number of countries made suggestions to further streamline the text.</p>
      <p>COLOMBIA requested that a work programme be developed to broaden the natinoal adaptation plan process to include other vulnerable developing countries.</p>
      <p>NORWAY opposed this, stating that national adaptation plans should only apply to the LDCs, as mandated.</p>
      <p>The US suggested sections on: general framing for national adaptation plans; a process on enabling the LDCs to formulate and implement those plans; and inviting other developing countries to employ the modalities for the plans.</p>
      <p>On finance, Bolivia, for the G-77/CHINA, requested reference to interim and long-term financing.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh, for the LDCs, said text on providing finance, technology and capacity building should be specific to LDCs.</p>
      <p>Delegates also said that some of the text regarding the Adaptation Committee was too ambitious, and pointed out that discussions on the Committee were still ongoing.</p>
      <p>Discussions continued in the evening.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>After a couple of long working days, negotiators reported mixed progress on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The SBSTA and SBI agendas appeared to be moving quite well through some key issues, while momentum on the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA packages appeared more uneven.</p>
      <p>Some delegates expressed frustration that certain issues, such as finance and shared vision, were still filled with posturing and long-held positions.</p>
      <p>One experienced NGO noted that with many issues still left on the table, some negotiators don t seem to be aware time is running out.</p>
      <p>At the same time, some observers felt that the defining lines of the negotiations were becoming clearer, while parties positions did not seem to be softening just yet.</p>
      <p>The EU was purportedly putting forward options and consulting with developed and developing countries on possible elements of an integrated outcome.</p>
      <p>Delegates were also reflecting on the role of the South African Presidency, which continued to consult informally with delegates in a variety of settings, pushing them to go further.</p>
      <p>Some were also praising the COP President s efforts at transparency, although at least one negotiator suggested that such openness may have its limits: At some point we will need to go into small negotiating groups if we re to make this package happen.</p>
      <p>The challenge will be doing this while also maintaining some level of openness and transparency, she said.</p>
