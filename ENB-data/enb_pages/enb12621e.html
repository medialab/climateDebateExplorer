      <h2>ADP OPENING PLENARY</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>COP 20 President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Minister of the Environment, Peru, called on parties to maintain the momentum generated in Lima and work responsibly, efficiently and in a spirit of compromise.</p>
      <p>ADP Co-Chair Ahmed Djoghlaf (Algeria) called on delegates to keep the promise made to our children in Durban.</p>

      <h2>ITEM 3:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Co-Chair Daniel Reifsnyder (US) underscored the objective of delivering a negotiating text on Friday and that the main task of the ADP contact group will be to ensure that the text fully reflects parties positions.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to the proposed organization of work.</p>
      <p>South Africa, for G-77/CHINA, noted that: the elements for a draft negotiating text annexed to Decision 1/CP.20 (Lima Call for Climate Action) are not fully negotiated; streamlining of options must be based on consensus; and parties views must be reflected in the text in a balanced manner.</p>
      <p>The EU urged progress on: ensuring dynamism in the 2015 agreement through regular review of ambition; clarifying how the agreement will deliver transparency and accountability with respect to mitigation; delivering climate resilience through adaptation and climate finance; and enhancing mitigation before 2020.</p>
      <p>Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, proposed distinguishing content that needs to be included in a legal agreement from content that is more appropriate for a COP decision.</p>
      <p>Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, proposed break-out groups to address specific issues and urged focusing on streamlining the text.</p>

      <h2>GENERAL/OBJECTIVE</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>On Section C General/Objective Co-Chair Reifsnyder suggested bracketing it and reflecting that some parties feel that the Section is not necessary.</p>
      <p>Parties made suggestions to add text and identified opportunities for consolidation.</p>
      <p>The US questioned the need for a separate Section on objectives.</p>
      <p>BRAZIL identified the Section as necessary to explain why a new agreement is needed.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA suggested omitting the Section, but if retained, then reflecting the objective in one to two paragraphs.</p>
      <p>Several parties suggested focusing the Section on the agreement s overall objective and including details on how to achieve this objective elsewhere.</p>
      <p>SINGAPORE called for addressing the relationship between the Convention and the new agreement.</p>
      <p>Maldives, for AOSIS, called for a reference to science on keeping the average temperature increase below 1.5 °C.</p>
      <p>JAMAICA proposed text on ensuring significant and rapid global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions of at least 70-90% by 2050.</p>
      <p>The EU underscored the need to reach zero net emissions of CO2 and other long-lived GHGs by the end of the century to ensure consistency with the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND agreed on the need to reflect the objective of achieving zero net GHG emissions.</p>
      <p>BRAZIL warned that references to the IPCC could lead to politicization.</p>
      <p>Sudan, for the AFRICAN GROUP, highlighted a new proposal on loss and damage.</p>
      <p>AOSIS underscored the need for high ambition from all parties; interlinkages between mitigation and adaptation; and addressing loss and damage. BRAZIL lamented that parts of the text are not in line with the Lima outcome, such as references to evolving CBDR.</p>
      <p>He supported undertakings by all Parties.</p>
      <p>The US proposed categorizing developed and developing countries into two new annexes.</p>
      <p>Malaysia, for the LMDCs, called for addressing adaptation with the same urgency as mitigation.</p>
      <p>He proposed emphasizing, inter alia , the link between developing countries mitigation actions and enhanced support by developed countries; and that developed countries must not resort to any unilateral measures on climate change.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA suggested combining text on ensuring resilience and adaptive capacity with text on ensuring that all investments are resilient to climate change.</p>
      <p>Several parties supported including text on gender equality.</p>
      <p>Tuvalu, for the LDCs, identified similarities between the proposals.</p>
      <p>MEXICO, supported by UGANDA, CHILE and BOLIVIA, also suggested text on human rights.</p>
      <p>Tuvalu, for LDCs, called for language on universal participation, human rights and rights of people with disabilities.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Reifsnyder indicated that informal discussion on the Section can be reconsidered at a later stage.</p>
      <p>He expressed satisfaction with progress made and said parties proposals together with revised Section C will be made available online promptly.</p>

      <h2>MITIGATION :</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>In the afternoon, the contact group focused on Section D on mitigation.</p>
      <p>Argentina, for the LMDCs, underscored, inter alia , that commitments, contributions and actions should comply with the Convention s principles and obligations, with developed country parties undertaking quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives (QELROs) that are comparable, verifiable and implemented without any conditions.</p>
      <p>She added that developing country actions may include REDD+ and joint adaptation and mitigation, in accordance with their specific circumstances and needs.</p>
      <p>Chile, for AILAC, suggested text on distinguishing between ex ante and ex post review of INDCs, proposing that all parties make successive mitigation commitments.</p>
      <p>On the use of market mechanisms in the land-use sector, he suggested including references to: environmental integrity; avoiding double counting; and a levy to support climate change resilience in developing countries.</p>
      <p>Panama, for CfRN, called for: the REDD+ framework be reflected and anchored in the new agreement; applying safeguards; and strengthening institutional arrangements under the Convention based on Decision 10/CP.19 on support for the implementation of mitigation activities in the forest sector by developing countries.</p>
      <p>The EU, inter alia : emphasized accounting rules and suggested bringing these from the Section on transparency of action and support, into the Section on mitigation.</p>
      <p>He proposed separating text on land use and market mechanisms.</p>
      <p>He highlighted the need for parties to periodically review and update their commitments.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA proposed text on national schedules and intended mitigation contributions, including that each party individually update their respective national schedules in accordance with modalities to be agreed by the governing body.</p>
      <p>Kenya, for the AFRICAN GROUP, emphasized developed countries obligation to provide MOI, and that social and economic development and poverty eradication are first and overriding priorities for developing countries.</p>
      <p>Maldives, for SIDS, proposed, inter alia , that proceeds from the use of market mechanisms will be used for meeting the costs of adaptation in the most vulnerable developing countries.</p>
      <p>Underlying the importance of text on peaking of global GHG emissions as soon as possible, TANZANIA proposed text specifying these efforts be quantitative and time-bound for developed countries and aspirational for developing countries.</p>
      <p>The US proposed replacing references to developed or developing countries throughout the text be replaced with reference to new annexes y and x.</p>
      <p>He proposed text to provide clarity on how parties engage in consultations on future cycles of contributions, specifying that parties should submit INDCs no later than six months before the beginning of each cycle.</p>
      <p>CANADA proposed text suggesting that all parties prepare national inventory reports in accordance with IPCC guidance. BRAZIL suggested text on an economic mechanism comprising an emissions trading system (ETS) and an enhanced Clean Development Mechanism (CDM+).</p>
      <p>He explained that parties with quantified mitigation targets could use ETS and CDM+ to supplement domestic action, and developing countries may participate in CDM+ projects on a voluntary basis.</p>
      <p>He emphasized voluntary cancellations of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) to enhance environmental integrity, saying cancelled CERs could be used to meet quantified financing targets or pledges but not mitigation targets. SENEGAL stated that market mechanisms and actions in the land-use sector should contribute to the sustainable development of the host countries.</p>
      <p>He proposed a centrally governed market mechanism under the Convention, building on existing market mechanisms.</p>
      <p>ETHIOPIA announced a new submission clarifying the details of market mechanisms in the 2015 agreement. SOUTH AFRICA stressed review as an integral part of a dynamic contribution cycle.</p>
      <p>She proposed text on common accounting rules to be developed by the COP.</p>
      <p>NEW ZEALAND noted that accounting rules must be more explicitly addressed in Section D, and, with NORWAY, stressed the importance of avoiding double-counting. BOLIVIA stressed the need for inclusion of alternative, non-market, and joint mitigation and adaptation approaches, and for adding text on the protection and integrity of Mother Earth.</p>
      <p>On a global emission budget, ETHIOPIA proposed including a reference to national per capita emissions and taking into account historical emissions.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>working group — corridors</small>
      <p>On a cold but sunny Sunday morning, delegates arrived in the historic Palais des Nations for the first of several negotiating sessions leading to Paris.</p>
      <p>Many felt the meeting got off to a good start.</p>
      <p>The opening plenary was described as surprisingly short and many expressed appreciation for the gesture by many negotiating groups to submit their opening statements electronically in the interest of time.</p>
      <p>The ADP morning contact group made good progress and closed ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>In the afternoon contact group, the mitigation section of the text grew in length with a total of 52 new proposals made.</p>
      <p>Regardless, that meeting closed an hour ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>Pleased with the progress, Co-Chair Reifsnyder joked that continuing with such efficiency, we will definitely have an agreement in Paris or even before.</p>
      <p>Having consulted with the negotiating group leaders, the Co-Chairs proposed to speed things up and collect all new textual proposals on Monday in order to focus the rest of the session on streamlining the text.</p>
      <p>On that note, many delegates said they anticipated a late evening to finalize negotiating groups internal coordinations on new text.</p>
