      <p>The Secretariat presented a scoping paper on cross-cutting thematic areas under the UNFCCC, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), and presented WSSD outcomes on synergies between these conventions.</p>
      <p>Parties discussed thematic areas, diverging on the terms of reference for a workshop.</p>
      <p>Chair Thorgeirsson requested a contact group, co-chaired by Jimena Nieto (Colombia) and Outi Berghäll (Finland), to resolve outstanding issues and prepare draft conclusions.</p>

      <p>The World Conservation Union (IUCN) and UNEP outlined their activities related to the implementation of Article 6.</p>
      <p>TUNISIA, with SENEGAL and CANADA, supported designating a climate change day.</p>
      <p>BELGIUM offered to host a regional workshop on Article 6 in 2003.</p>
      <p>The US cautioned against linking discussion on Article 6 to reporting and financing issues.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="section_3">
      <h2>OTHER MATTERS</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy: CANADA introduced draft decision text supported by NEW ZEALAND, POLAND, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and SLOVENIA, and opposed by SAUDI ARABIA for the G-77/CHINA, SWITZERLAND, and the US.</p>
      <p>The text requests the Secretariat to ask competent organizations to analyze the role of trade in cleaner energy in meeting the objective of the UNFCCC and the Protocol, and to report back to SBSTA-21.</p>
      <p>Several Parties reaffirmed their objection to Canadas original proposal on accounting for cleaner energy exports.</p>
      <p>The EU said that only generic issues relating to trade in cleaner energy should be discussed.</p>
      <p>Chair Thorgeirsson will undertake consultations on this issue.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4">
      <h2>Implementation of Protocol Article 2.3</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Parties discussed issues relating to possible workshops.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA argued for a draft decision requesting the Secretariat to analyse the adverse effects of P&amp;Ms on developing countries.</p>
      <p>Chair Thorgeirsson said he would undertake consultations on this issue.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_5">
      <h2>ADVERSE EFFECTS</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Progress on implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7: Parties discussed implementation issues on adverse effects, as well as outcomes of a workshop on modeling held in Bonn in May 2002, and arrangements for workshops on insurance and risk assessment. The G-77/CHINA expressed concern about the lack of financial support for the implementation of the decision.</p>
      <p>Addressing the lack of funding for the workshops on insurance and risk assessment, she called for a mechanism to finance the workshops and proposed creating an expert group on adaptation.</p>
      <p>CANADA expressed interest in supporting the workshops.</p>
      <p>Several Parties stressed the importance of insurance related issues.</p>
      <p>SAMOA highlighted two reports indicating that nearly all losses in developing countries due to extreme events are not covered by insurance.</p>
      <p>JAPAN and others cautioned against holding too many workshops.</p>
      <p>IRAN stressed that the workshops should also address adaptation to the impact of response measures.</p>
      <p>Chair Estrada called on Daniela Stoytcheva (Bulgaria) and Enele Sopoaga (Tuvalu) to conduct informal consultations with Parties on the terms of reference for the workshops. On modeling, Parties noted that additional efforts are required.</p>
      <p>SAMOA said current models do not provide a solid basis for policy- making.</p>

      <h2>Matters relating to LDCs</h2>
      <small></small>

      <p>He noted that the Group had decided against revising NAPA guidelines at COP-8, preferring to do this at COP-9.</p>
      <p>The EU commended the work of the LEG, and underscored the importance of adaptation for sustainable development and poverty eradication. CANADA noted that his countrys adaptation support prioritizes LDCs.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA said several activities related to LDCs outlined in decision 2/CP.7 (capacity building in developing countries) could be undertaken before completing NAPAs.</p>
      <p>TUVALU noted difficulty in seeking funding for NAPAs from the GEF.</p>

      <p>COP-8 President Baalu invited Parties to discuss the Delhi Declaration informally.</p>
      <p>Numerous speakers supported the Chairs proposal for an implementation-oriented declaration focusing on climate change and sustainable development, building on the WSSD outcome.</p>
      <p>Several Parties proposed urging the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, and emphasized a focus on adaptation and poverty eradication.</p>
      <p>Many argued for a two-pronged approach that would stress mitigation and adaptation.</p>
      <p>Several Annex I countries supported a forward-looking declaration that would emphasize the need to broaden and deepen commitments globally in preparation for the second commitment period and beyond. Stressing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, a number of developing country representatives said Annex I Parties must take the lead, and opposed any process that would lead to new developing country commitments.</p>
      <p>One Annex I Party stressed economic growth as the key to environmental progress, and the right of all to prosperity, cautioning against burdensome targets for developing countries.</p>
      <p>Many countries supported an emphasis on renewable energy.</p>
