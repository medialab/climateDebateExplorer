      <p>Some parties highlighted that the rules of procedure have not been adopted because of lack of agreement on voting rules, and called for a forward-looking process, without re-opening past decisions.</p>
      <p>There was convergence on a party-driven process and the need to: respect the sovereignty of all parties; recognize that all have an opportunity to be heard; and ensure inclusiveness, legitimacy and transparency.</p>
      <p>Some parties emphasized the need to avoid taking decisions 'in the corridors or backrooms', citing COP 15 as an example.</p>
      <p>While there was some convergence on the timeliness of discussions to increase the effectiveness of negotiations, some expressed concern over 'sacrificing inclusiveness for effectiveness'.</p>
      <p>Others called for revisiting recent practices that have favored the adoption of decisions as 'a package'.</p>
      <p>Many questioned the way small negotiating groups are constituted, stressing that some parties with an interest in the issue may not get invited.</p>
      <p>On the outcome, some parties called for a COP 19 decision on decision-making in the UNFCCC process, while others underscored the need to keep the discussion open, without getting 'fixated' on a formal outcome.</p>
      <p>Informal consultations will continue.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>After many late nights of negotiations, the first week of the conference came to an end, with exhausted delegates leaving the venue early on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>In their weariness, some delegates pondered the wider impact of all their work, and many expressed concern over some Annex I parties' low or reduced mitigation ambition.</p>
      <p>One delegate commented: 'we are supposed to be moving far and fast, but it feels as if we are moving backwards'.</p>
      <p>In the streets surrounding the venue, over 1.200 people participating in a Saturday afternoon march for climate justice shared the same sentiment, displaying banners calling for 'System Change, not Climate Change'.</p>
      <p>Some bleary-eyed delegates expressed hope that limited progress made this first week was only a warm up for the 'big game' in the second week when ministers arrive to 'flex their political muscles'.</p>
