      <h2>REDD-PLUS (AWG-LCA)</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In informal consultations on REDD-plus, parties addressed scope and objectives.</p>
      <p>Parties discussed whether the scope should include percentage goals and whether specific activities that comprise REDD-plus should be listed.</p>
      <p>A drafting group on REDD-plus met in the evening. MITIGATION BY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (AWG-LCA): In the morning informal consultations on mitigation by developing countries under sub-paragraph 1(b)(ii) of the BAP, parties continued discussions on supported NAMAs and focused on the MRV section in non-paper No.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries supported the first option for a title of the section that states that support for NAMAs comes from developed countries, while some developed countries preferred a more inclusive approach, reflected in the second option.</p>
      <p>Several developed countries supported international verification of NAMAs.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries stressed this should be conducted at the domestic level.</p>
      <p>Some developed countries, opposed by many developing countries, also supported importing text on MRV from non-paper No.</p>
      <p>28. OTHER ISSUES (AWG-KP): During morning informal consultations focusing on the flexibility mechanisms, parties discussed how to proceed with the work of the group.</p>
      <p>Discussions focused in particular on either: continuing discussion of the issues on which consensus was not envisaged; or forwarding such issues to the COP/MOP to decide either to take no further action on the issue or to request the SBSTA to develop procedures and modalities for relevant action.</p>
      <p>Parties then considered the text ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/10/Add.3/Rev.3 , Annex I) and identified those issues in the text that could be further considered by the group and those that could be referred to the COP/MOP.</p>
      <p>In the afternoon, the group continued to meet in informal consultations to discuss the basket of methodological issues.</p>
      <p>Parties finished working through the text and discussed the inclusion of new greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p>Some advocated adding new gases or species of gases, while others emphasized that amendment of the Protocol to include new gases was beyond the scope of the group s mandate. PROTOCOL ARTICLES 2.3 AND 3.14 (SBI/SBSTA): In the joint SBI/SBSTA contact group on Protocol Articles 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures) and 3.14 (adverse effects and impacts of responses), parties worked through documents FCCC/SBSTA/2009/L.10 and FCCC/SBI/2009/L.11.</p>
      <p>The EU expressed a preference for joint conclusions.</p>
      <p>On matters relating to Protocol Article 2.3, parties discussed text on better understanding of the issues.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA called for a focus on the poorest and most vulnerable parties.</p>
      <p>Parties also consolidated options on the need to share information.</p>
      <p>On matters relating to Protocol Article 3.14, parties discussed the meaning of a phased approach and the paragraph on coordination across working groups. FINANCIAL MECHANISM (SBI): On the fourth review of the financial mechanism, the EU proposed streamlining the draft conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2009/L.15/Rev.1) by deleting several preambular paragraphs.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA and NORWAY called for a focus on core issues.</p>
      <p>The US said its Congress was considering a request for US$ 50 million for the GEF for various climate change activities, to be included in the 2010 budget.</p>
      <p>The contact group was then suspended following a request from the Bahamas, for the G-77/CHINA, to enable the Group to coordinate. DECISION 1/CP.10 (SBI): The contact group on decision 1/CP.10 (Buenos Aires programme of work on adaptation and response measures) met in the morning to discuss submissions by parties on possible further action (FCCC/SBI/2009/MISC.11/Rev.1) and draft conclusions proposed by the Chair. SAUDI ARABIA emphasized that the Chair s text does not reflect the submissions of the G-77/China and that the current text reflects starting from the beginning.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA, NORWAY and the US supported using the draft text as the basis for discussions.</p>
      <p>The EU suggested it would be helpful to look at the submissions and outcomes of workshops, drawing out common elements and inserting them in the text.</p>
      <p>The US recommended focusing on the draft conclusions rather than on possible decision text, since progress on the annexes was unlikely.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA and LIBYA called for inclusion of the G-77/China submissions.</p>
      <p>The COOK ISLANDS, while supporting inclusion of the G-77/China submission, stressed the importance of moving to substantive discussions.</p>
      <p>The Secretariat noted that they would distribute document FCCC/SBI/2008/MISC.10, containing the G-77/China submission, at the next meeting of the group. COMMON METRICS (SBSTA): In informal consultations on common metrics parties discussed draft conclusions.</p>
      <p>Parties highlighted that scientific work on the issue is ongoing and discussed how it should be taken up in the future. ANNEX I EMISSION REDUCTIONS (AWG-KP): At the morning s contact group, Co-Chair Wollansky reported on informal consultations held on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>She identified consensus on having one single legally-binding base year instead of multiple binding base years.</p>
      <p>However, she said the single base year would not necessarily be the same for all parties.</p>
      <p>She identified a lot of support for including reference years in the Protocol amendment and said there was consensus that 1990 should be one of them.</p>
      <p>On the mention of a Protocol amendment, JAPAN and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION also stressed their desire for a comprehensive and global legal framework, not a mere Protocol extension.</p>
      <p>The RUSSIAN FEDERATION stressed that their possible reduction range was not intended for the Protocol and that it was contingent on the outcome of the overall negotiations.</p>
      <p>JAPAN said their mid-term target was also based on a comprehensive legal framework.</p>
      <p>The GAMBIA, with ALGERIA, the SUDAN and ZAMBIA, expressed concern over reiterating these positions and called for good faith discussions under the Protocol.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA identified support for two possible legal outcomes, including a possible continuation of the Protocol, while stressing the need for a legally-binding outcome under the AWG-LCA. CHINA, supported by ALGERIA, BOLIVIA and VENEZUELA, emphasized the need for ambitious commitments from Annex I parties, that developed countries are supposed to lead and that they are obligated under the Kyoto Protocol to commit to reductions in a second commitment period. AOSIS called for increased ambition.</p>
      <p>The G/77-CHINA said that the focus of the group s mandate is on Annex I party responsibilities.</p>
      <p>CROATIA noted that some Annex I countries emit less per capita than some developing countries, highlighting the inclusion of all countries in emission reduction efforts.</p>
      <p>The EU stressed that Annex B parties represent only 30% of global emissions.</p>
      <p>The EU presented on current Annex I pledges in relation to an aggregate 30% emission reduction target.</p>
      <p>He noted that failing to address the issues of AAU surplus and using either current rules or unconstrained gross-net accounting rules for LULUCF would result in increased emissions from the 1990 baseline.</p>
      <p>He highlighted that even before the AAU surplus and accounting rules, current pledges are insufficient to achieve reductions necessary to meet the IPCC range of a 25-40% reduction from 1990 levels by 2020. BRAZIL requested that AAU carryover issues be resolved separate from discussions of level of ambition.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA asked to see disaggregated data for the EU bubble.</p>
      <p>AOSIS noted that 30% falls short of the level of ambition required.</p>
      <p>The EU clarified that they had used capability, responsibility, early action and population as criteria to calculate assigned amounts for individual countries.</p>
      <p>In the afternoon, informal consultations continued on Annex I emission reductions to discuss length and number of commitment periods.</p>
      <p>Parties exchanged views on the pros and cons of a five-year versus an eight-year commitment period.</p>
      <p>Considerations included: domestic constraints related to legislation and ratification processes; and ability to respond to science, including a possible mid-term review for an eight-year cycle. NAIROBI WORK PROGRAMME (NWP) (SBSTA): The group on the NWP met for informal discussions in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Parties discussed the Co-Chairs draft conclusions, including reporting burdens associated with networking partnerships and reflecting the catalytic role of the NWP in the text. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (SBI/SBSTA): During the afternoon s contact group, Co-Chair Liptow said the group s deliberations would be based on documents FCCC/SB/2009/4, Summary and INF.6, and FCCC/SBI/2009/14.</p>
      <p>He also clarified that the outcome of deliberations would be two sets of conclusions: one for the SBI and another for the SBSTA.</p>
      <p>He urged parties to focus discussions on procedural issues and defer substantive comments to future SB sessions or to technology discussions under the AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>The US urged increased engagement of the private sector in technology transfer.</p>
      <p>India, for the G-77/CHINA, urged consideration of how to complete the report on performance indicators.</p>
      <p>Noting that there may be substantive outcomes on technology from Copenhagen, he suggested tailoring the EGTT s work programme to consider such outcomes.</p>
      <p>CANADA noted that the report on performance indicators is the final report.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA also called for further consideration of the GEF s report on implementation of the PoznaÅ strategic programme on technology transfer, particularly regarding the effectiveness of the implementation.</p>
      <p>The US noted the possibility of having a further report at SB 32 on the implementation of the programme, including on technology needs assessments and pilot projects.</p>
      <p>BANGLADESH said the report should also consider the role of implementing agencies.</p>
      <p>The Co-Chairs will prepare draft SBI and SBSTA conclusions for consideration on Thursday. CAPACITY BUILDING (AWG-LCA): During the afternoon, the AWG-LCA drafting group on capacity building continued informal discussions on proposed capacity building actions. FINANCING (AWG-LCA): The informal drafting group on finance met in the morning and afternoon, and parties continued consideration of institutional arrangements in non-paper No.</p>
      <p>In the afternoon, parties discussed a diagram depicting a possible organizational structure for institutional arrangements and governance for the proposed financial architecture, aimed at helping move negotiations forward.</p>
      <p>Several parties expressed concern that the administrative layers envisaged, comprising the COP, a high-level body or executive body, the funds and funding windows, could prove to be burdensome and bureaucratic.</p>
      <p>Others highlighted the importance of determining the functions of the high-level board as well as the need for a monitoring function for financial commitments.</p>
      <p>A non-paper reflecting the organizational structure for institutional arrangements will be produced and informal discussions will continue. REDD (SBSTA): In the informal consultations on REDD under SBSTA, parties continued to work through draft decision text.</p>
      <p>Parties focused on identifying activities and drivers of deforestation, the use of guidance and guidelines from the IPCC and national forest monitoring systems. MITIGATION (AWG-LCA): In the informal consultations on sectoral approaches, parties worked through a draft text on agriculture and will continue discussion on this text on Thursday. OTHER ISSUES - LULUCF (AWG-KP): In the morning, informal consultations on LULUCF addressed natural disturbances, and in the afternoon parties considered harvested wood products and reference levels. SHARED VISION (AWG-LCA): In informal consultations, parties were presented with a new draft text on a shared vision.</p>
      <p>Parties expressed initial views on the text, with many agreeing to use it as the basis for further work.</p>
      <p>Several parties suggested shortening the text to make it more operational.</p>
      <p>Several developing countries highlighted the importance of text requiring developed countries to refrain from unilateral protectionist trade measures.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries underlined that a shared visionshould, inter alia , be viewed in the context of sustainable development.</p>
      <p>Parties then considered the text paragraph-by-paragraph. ADAPTATION (AWG-LCA): In the informal consultations on adaptation, parties focused on a new draft text.</p>
      <p>They considered merging options and streamlining text in the preamble and introductory paragraph.</p>
      <p>Informal consultations continued in the evening. TECHNOLOGY (AWG-LCA): The informal drafting group on technology met in the afternoon and considered new draft text on enhanced action on technology development and transfer.</p>
      <p>While some delegates said that the document was useable, others said it could be shortened and expressed concern that it did not reflect the latest input from parties and the main ideas from non-paper No.</p>
      <p>47, with elements such as the technology mechanism lacking clear articulation.</p>
      <p>The meeting was suspended to allow for informal consultations on the way forward.</p>
      <p>Parties eventually agreed on a condensed formulation regarding the technology mechanism consisting of an executive body or committee and a consultative network for climate technology.</p>
      <p>A revised draft text will be produced on Thursday.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>The corridors were buzzing on Wednesday afternoon following an intense COP morning plenary.</p>
      <p>Tuvalu s statement calling for parties in Copenhagen to sign a new legally-binding protocol under the Convention to complement an amended Kyoto Protocol, and to discuss this in a contact group, was the cause of the commotion.</p>
      <p>Many countries from AOSIS, Latin America and Africa were backing Tuvalu s call.</p>
      <p>However, several other developing countries, such as India and China, opposed the idea, fearing it would divert attention away from negotiations on a second commitment period for Annex I parties under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>These countries stressed the need to focus on the AWG-LCA s outcome on the Convention s implementation, rather than adopting a new protocol.</p>
      <p>Tuvalu s call for a new legally-binding instrument also roused significant civil society backing.</p>
      <p>When returning to the plenary in the afternoon, delegates had to pass through a vocal crowd shouting their support for the proposal.</p>
      <p>As the demonstration was unauthorized, security guards promptly responded and kept the throng in the corridors and away from the meeting room.</p>
      <p>We are afraid this is a sign of increasingly tight security to come, commented one NGO participant.</p>
      <p>Other signs of the growing tension in Copenhagen included reports of non-violent clashes between civil society and a group of climate change skeptics.</p>
      <p>Things are definitely starting to heat up, commented one delegate.</p>
      <p>This was evident also from the fact that ministers and other high-level delegates have started to arrive in Copenhagen, including a Chinese minister and the US Special Climate Change Envoy.</p>
      <p>A list of Heads of State intending to attend the high-level segment was in the process of being finalized.</p>
      <p>There was also further fallout from Tuesday s leaking of the Danish text, with some delegates wondering who on the Danish side had been taking the lead, and several delegates from the South taking exception to the process as much as the substance.</p>
      <p>They should have engaged more with us, said one LDC representative.</p>
      <p>The group that was privy to this document was too exclusive and one-sided, said another developing country delegate.</p>
      <p>Many developed countries, however, continued to play down the significance of the text, as well as the leak.</p>
