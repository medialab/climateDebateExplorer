      <h2>FINANCIAL MECHANISM</h2>
      <p>Adaptation Fund: Delegates considered financial issues in a contact group and informal discussions.</p>
      <p>The Co-Chairs introduced revised text and proposed deleting several sections of the draft COP/MOP decision.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to this remaining text, which contains, inter alia: the preamble; reference to the purpose of the Fund; guidance on the operation of the Fund; further guidance on policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria for its operation that will be adopted at COP MOP 2; text on the submission of views on policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria for consideration at SBI 24; and guidance on a workshop on further guidance for operation of the Fund before SBI 24. The approved language was submitted to SBI later in the day, and SBI adopted conclusions and a draft COP/MOP decision (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.32).</p>

      <h2>Guidance to the GEF</h2>
      <p>Delegates continued discussions in a contact group, considering a revised draft decision that would apply the current MOU between the COP and the GEF to the COP/MOP and GEF.</p>
      <p>South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, said there was no need for an MOU given that the existing MOU covers the Convention.</p>
      <p>JAPAN, the EU, and SWITZERLAND said the MOU was needed and supported the draft.</p>
      <p>SBI Chair Becker reported to plenary on lack of agreement, and the item was forwarded to SBI 24 for further consideration.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12288e_12">
      <h2>Special Climate Change Fund</h2>
      <p>With no agreement on his proposal to remove the remaining brackets in the draft conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.34), Chair Becker introduced new conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/CRP.4).</p>
      <p>South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, did not support the Chair's text and proposed forwarding both the text from SBI 22 (FCCC/SBI/2005/10 Annex 1) and the G-77/CHINA submission to SB 24 for consideration.</p>
      <p>SBI agreed to forward text from SB 22 to SB 24.</p>

      <p>SBSTA adopted conclusions on harvested wood products (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.16) and conclusions and a draft COP decision on the common reporting format (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.19 &amp; Add.1). Emissions from Fuel Used for International Aviation and Maritime Transport: Jos√© Romero (Switzerland) reported to SBSTA that no consensus had been reached in consultations.</p>
      <p>The EU and NORWAY, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, requested more time to negotiate.</p>

      <h2>SIDS</h2>
      <p>Chair Benrageb proposed holding the agenda item on follow up to the International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of SIDS in abeyance.</p>
      <p>The US opposed this, stating that it considers that the issue was concluded at SBSTA 22.</p>
      <p>Tuvalu, for AOSIS, stressed that the Mauritius Strategy has been accepted as the UN programme for SIDS, and is recognized by the General Assembly.</p>
      <p>The EU and AUSTRALIA expressed disappointment that no progress was made.</p>
      <p>The matter was taken up in informal consultations to decide whether the issue should remain on SBSTA's agenda.</p>
      <p>Following discussions on the usefulness of holding an item in abeyance ad infinitum as opposed to exploring other options such as side events or workshops, Parties finally agreed at 12:30 am to include this item in the provisional agenda for SBSTA 24.</p>

      <p>Consideration of this issue resumed in a morning contact group, following informal consultations that continued until late Monday night.</p>

      <p>Co-Chair Dovland noted that an agreement had not been possible even after several informal consultations.</p>
      <p>He explained that the key differences still related to how the compliance mechanism should be adopted at COP/MOP 1, and how the process will continue regarding an amendment to the Protocol to make the system legally binding.</p>
      <p>He said the outstanding questions would be solved either through further informal consultations or by President Dion.</p>
      <p>Although differences narrowed, no agreement was reached during informal consultations on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

      <p>On a very late night for SBSTA, some delegates were heard expressing their disappointment that the Mauritius Strategy for SIDS failed to make it onto the agenda of this SBSTA.</p>
      <p>Although many Parties appeared to favor consideration of this item, the US was vigorous in its objections, citing procedural issues.</p>
      <p>'Small island States are being drowned out by the large mainland States,' alleged one observer.</p>
      <p>For its part, the US has argued forcefully that the issue has already been given thorough consideration in other fora and that this is not the right place for this discussion.
