      <p>INDIA stated that the AWG would have to wait until 2008 before parties could see what Annex I parties were prepared to accept.</p>

      <h2>IN THE BREEZEWAYS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Delegates were surprised at the relative speed with which the SCCF issue was concluded Tuesday and speculated that this might be linked to progress on the Adaptation Fund.</p>
      <p>Skeptics, however, recalled the climate process is in the habit of collecting empty funds.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, with agreement on the majority of items under the financial mechanism, some delegates reportedly glimpsed the first steps in the confidence building process that will be required to pull together a post-2012 regime.</p>
      <p>Others observed the beginnings of attempts to tie up the Russian proposal, the AWG and the Article 9 review in a special Christmas package of negotiating opportunities and issue linkages.</p>
      <p>An Indian delegate caught the mood of negotiations on future commitments when he compared the long wait that will precede the unveiling of future Annex I commitments with marriage customs where the groom must await the wedding night before viewing the bride.</p>
