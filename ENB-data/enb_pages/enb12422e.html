      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small>HISTORY</small>
      <p>The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992, which sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994 and now has 192 parties.</p>
      <p>In December 1997, delegates at COP 3 in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission reduction targets.</p>
      <p>These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I parties, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and now has 184 parties.</p>
      <p>In 2005, the first Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties (COP/MOP 1), held in Montreal, Canada, established the AWG-KP on the basis of Protocol Article 3.9, which mandates consideration of Annex I parties further commitments at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period.</p>
      <p>In addition, COP 11 agreed in Montreal to consider long-term cooperation under the Convention through a series of four workshops known as the Convention Dialogue, which continued until COP 13.</p>

      <h2>BALI ROADMAP:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 took place in December 2007, in Bali, Indonesia.</p>
      <p>The focus of the Bali conference was on long-term issues.</p>
      <p>These negotiations resulted in the adoption of the Bali Action Plan, which established the AWG-LCA with a mandate to focus on four key elements of long-term cooperation identified during the Convention Dialogue: mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology.</p>
      <p>The Bali Action Plan contains a non-exhaustive list of issues to be considered under each of these areas and calls for articulating a shared vision for long-term cooperative action.</p>
      <p>The Bali conference also resulted in an agreement on a two-year process, the Bali Roadmap, which covers negotiation tracks under the Convention and the Protocol and sets a deadline for concluding the negotiations at COP 15 and COP/MOP 5, to be held in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
      <p>The two key bodies under the Bali Roadmap are the AWG-LCA and the AWG-KP, which held four negotiation sessions in 2008: April in Bangkok, Thailand; June in Bonn, Germany; August in Accra, Ghana; and December in Poznán, Poland.</p>

      <h2>COP 14:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>During COP 14 in Poznán, AWG-LCA 4 continued discussing all the key elements of the Bali Action Plan.</p>
      <p>It mandated the AWG-LCA Chair to prepare a document for consideration by AWG-LCA 5 that would focus negotiations on the fulfillment of the Bali Action Plan and a negotiating text for AWG-LCA 6 in June 2009. AWG-KP 6 held a strategic discussion on all elements of its work programme and decided that in order to finalize agreement on Annex I parties further commitments at COP/MOP 5, the AWG-KP would need to consider in 2009 the aggregate scale of emission reductions by Annex I parties, the contribution by parties individually or jointly to the aggregate scale, as well as other issues identified in paragraph 49 of its conclusions (FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/8) .</p>
      <p>These issues include: the flexibility mechanisms; LULUCF; greenhouse gases, sectors and sources; potential consequences of tools, policies, measures and methodologies; aviation and maritime bunker fuels; and legal matters.</p>

      <h2>AWG-LCA 5 &amp; AWG-KP 7</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>From 29 March 8 April 2009, AWG-LCA 5 and AWG-KP 7 convened in Bonn, Germany.</p>
      <p>The main objective of the session was to work towards negotiating text under both AWGs.</p>
      <p>The AWG-LCA considered a note prepared by the Chair to focus negotiations on the fulfillment of the Bali Action Plan and on the components of the agreed outcome ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/4 , Parts I and II).</p>
      <p>Discussions at AWG-LCA 5 focused on further elaborating elements for a draft negotiating text to be prepared by the Chair for the next AWG-LCA session in June 2009. AWG-KP 7 focused on emission reductions by Annex I parties under the Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012 and on legal issues, including possible amendments to the Protocol.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP also considered the other issues in its work programme, including the flexibility mechanisms, LULUCF and potential consequences of response measures.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP agreed to request its Chair to prepare two documents for the June session: a proposal for amendments to the Protocol under Article 3.9 (Annex I parties further commitments); and a text on other issues, such as LULUCF and the flexibility mechanisms.</p>

      <h2>AWG-LCA 6 &amp; AWG-KP 8</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>From 1-14 June 2009, AWG-LCA 6 and AWG-KP 8 convened in Bonn, Germany, in conjunction with the 30th sessions of the UNFCCC s Subsidiary Body for Implementation and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice. AWG-LCA 6 concentrated on developing negotiating text, using a Chair s draft ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/8 ) as the starting point.</p>
      <p>During the session, parties clarified and developed their proposals and the main outcome was a revised negotiating text ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/INF.1 ), which is nearly 200 pages long and covers all the main elements of the Bali Action Plan. AWG-KP 8 continued considering Annex I parties further commitments under the Protocol.</p>
      <p>Discussions focused on proposals by various parties for Annex I countries aggregate and individual emission reduction targets beyond 2012.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP agreed to continue discussions on these as well as on other issues, such as LULUCF and the flexibility mechanisms, based on documentation prepared by the AWG-KP Chair.</p>
      <p>By the end of the June session, the Secretariat had also received five submissions from parties for a new protocol under the Convention, and twelve submissions concerning amendments to the Kyoto Protocol, proposed for adoption in Copenhagen.</p>

      <h2>GREENLAND DIALOGUE:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>From 30 June to 3 July 2009, a closed-door ministerial gathering on climate change was held in Illulissat, Greenland.</p>
      <p>The meeting was the fifth in a series of informal discussions launched by the Danish Minister for Climate and Energy, and was attended by 29 ministers and heads of delegation from key countries.</p>
      <p>According to the Chair s summary, ministers committed to success in Copenhagen and expressed determination to take action to remain below a global average temperature increase of 2°C above pre-industrial levels.</p>
      <p>They highlighted the need for leadership by developed countries and appreciated that developing country actions must be strengthened to meet the demands of science.</p>
      <p>The ministers also stressed, inter alia , the importance of finance for an agreement in Copenhagen.</p>

      <h2>GROUP OF 8/MAJOR ECONOMIES FORUM ON ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>From 8-10 July, the Group of Eight (G8) summit was held in L Aquila, Italy.</p>
      <p>The Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change (MEF) convened concurrently.</p>
      <p>Climate change was addressed in both meetings.</p>
      <p>The G8 leaders recognized the scientific view that the increase in global average temperature ought not to exceed 2°C from pre-industrial levels.</p>
      <p>They reiterated the global long-term goal of reducing emissions by at least 50% by 2050.</p>
      <p>As part of this, they supported the goal that developed countries should reduce emissions by at least 80% by 2050.</p>
      <p>They highlighted the need for mid-term targets consistent with the global goals and for global emissions to reach their peak as soon as possible and decline thereafter.</p>
      <p>The MEF, attended by 16 countries and the European Union, resulted in a declaration.</p>
      <p>The MEF countries resolved to spare no effort to reach an agreement in Copenhagen to further implementation of the Convention.</p>
      <p>They indicated that in the midterm, developed countries should take robust emission reductions and that developing countries should take meaningful actions to reduce emissions compared to business as usual levels.</p>
      <p>The MEF also agreed to cooperate between now and Copenhagen to identify a global goal for substantially reducing global emissions by 2050.</p>
      <p>The MEF stressed that adaptation is essential and decided to launch a Global Partnership to drive transformational, low-carbon, climate-friendly technologies.</p>
      <p>It also stated that financial resources for mitigation and adaptation will need to be scaled up urgently and substantially, and should involve mobilizing resources to support developing countries.</p>
      <p>The MEF countries also agreed that they will continue meeting this year to facilitate agreement in Copenhagen.</p>
