      <h2>AWG-LCA WORKSHOP ON A SHARED VISION</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Delegates continued their discussions, with many interventions focusing on mitigation action by developed countries, as well as linkages between a shared vision and the objective and principles of the Convention.</p>
      <p>The provision of adequate financial resources and technology transfer, and prioritizing adaptation, were also emphasized.</p>
      <p>South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, noted that a shared vision should address all elements of the Bali Action Plan.</p>
      <p>The EU highlighted that a shared vision requires efforts by all parties.</p>
      <p>The US said a shared vision should be optimistic, pragmatic and reflect evolving scientific and economic realities.</p>
      <p>ICELAND supported efforts to globalize the carbon market.</p>
      <p>BOLIVIA said the financing provisions should be on a par with developed countries spending to rescue financial institutions during the current financial crisis.</p>
      <p>SINGAPORE and SAUDI ARABIA emphasized national circumstances.</p>
      <p>EGYPT, TANZANIA and GUATEMALA called for special attention to the most vulnerable countries.</p>

      <h2>AWG-KP WORKSHOP ON MITIGATION POTENTIALS</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>The Secretariat presented the updated technical paper (FCCC/2008/TP/10).</p>
      <p>Former IPCC Working Group III Co-Chair Bert Metz highlighted how assumptions about emission reductions by Annex I countries affect action by non-Annex I countries for different stabilization scenarios.</p>
      <p>He explained that 25-40% reductions by Annex I countries by 2020 would mean 15-30% deviation from the baseline for non-Annex I countries to achieve 450 ppm, and 0-20% deviation for 550 ppm.</p>
      <p>Barbara Buchner, International Energy Agency, said the reference scenario without new policies is unsustainable and would result in 750 ppm and a 6ºC temperature rise.</p>
      <p>She identified the need for an enormous energy transformation involving all regions and sectors.</p>
      <p>She said the additional cost would not be high but the real challenges are the scale and practicalities of the transformation. CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA and ALGERIA stressed the AWG-KP s mandate and the need to limit discussions to Annex I countries.</p>
      <p>The EU warned that reduction goals could be weakened depending on the rules adopted for LULUCF, carbon credits and bunker fuels.</p>
      <p>JAPAN proposed ensuring comparability of efforts by aggregating sectoral potentials and cross-checking with indicators, including greenhouse gas intensity, marginal abatement costs and percent of GDP.</p>
      <p>The RUSSIAN FEDERATION identified three specific indicators: population-weighted heating degree days; population-weighted average distance between ten major cities; and the export-import balance of greenhouse gas intensive products.</p>
      <p>Tuvalu, for AOSIS, urged including the costs of inaction as well as action, and said Annex I parties should focus on domestic emission reductions.</p>
      <p>He proposed that LULUCF not be expanded under the CDM, that 1990 remain as the base year to ensure comparability, and that the second commitment period run from 2013-2017. CANADA said useful indicators for calculating mitigation potentials included the marginal costs of abatement, cost of emission reductions as a percentage of GDP, and the percentage of welfare loss. NEW ZEALAND highlighted national circumstances and detailed costs for mitigation.</p>
      <p>SOUTH AFRICA stressed cumulative responsibility and said mitigation potentials need to be converted into actual emission reductions.</p>
      <p>CHINA said mitigation potential is determined by political will.</p>

      <h2>SBI ROUND TABLE ON ADVERSE EFFECTS AND RESPONSE MEASURES</h2>
      <small>SBI</small>
      <p>SBI Chair Asadi explained that this SBI-mandated round table aimed to exchange experiences, lessons and best practices in planning and implementing actions to address adverse effects of climate change and the impact of response measures.</p>
      <p>On lessons learned, many supported country-led approaches and the full integration of adaptation into national planning.</p>
      <p>Multi-stakeholder involvement and activities at the regional and local levels were also stressed.</p>
      <p>On the UNFCCC s role, speakers welcomed its work in catalyzing information sharing.</p>
      <p>Many suggested additional activities, including providing further support to governments and strengthening collaboration with other groups.</p>
      <p>A framework or mechanism to consider response measures under the SBI was proposed.</p>
      <p>On gaps and constraints, several developing countries noted bureaucratic hurdles in accessing funding.</p>
      <p>Capacity building for monitoring and assessing the impact of response measures was discussed, as was data collection and economic modeling.</p>

    <div id="section_4">
      <h2>ARTICLE 9 (COP/MOP)</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Co-Chairs Kleymeyer and Macey explained that the draft text would be circulated only after the plenary statements have been completed and said this session would focus on procedural issues.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Macey clarified the COP/MOP s decision to streamline work on issues considered under several agenda items.</p>
      <p>He explained that privileges and immunities would be discussed mainly under the SBI contact group while the Article 9 contact group would approve and incorporate the relevant text into its decision.</p>
      <p>On the flexible mechanisms, he said the Article 9 group would give priority to their scope, effectiveness and functioning while the CDM contact group would focus on the CDM s operational aspects and equitable distribution.</p>
      <p>CHINA and others raised concerns over the CDM being discussed in different groups and emphasized the need to avoid parallel meetings.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Participants at the workshop on shared vision seemed pleased as they left the event on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The most important achievement is that we all agree that a shared vision is not only about targets and that it should address all elements of the Bali Action Plan, said one developing country delegate.</p>
      <p>Another participant said he was honestly encouraged and was looking forward to further discussions in a contact group.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the AWG-KP workshop on mitigation potentials seemed to elicit some strong responses.</p>
      <p>While some were impressed at the quality of presentations, more than one delegate seemed surprised that a few of the presentations focused on developing country action.</p>
      <p>I thought the AWG-KP was all about Annex I commitments - what just happened?</p>
      <p>asked one observer.</p>
