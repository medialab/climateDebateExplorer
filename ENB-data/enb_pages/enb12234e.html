      <h2>NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
      <p>Submission of second, and where appropriate, third national communications: Several developing countries emphasized that the frequency of communications depends on the availability of financial and technical support.</p>
      <p>The US said developing countries should submit national communications every four years, and greenhouse gas inventories every two years, while LDCs should submit communications every five years.</p>
      <p>SAMOA emphasized the importance of avoiding duplication of work between the national communication and NAPA processes, and, with BARBADOS, noted that none of the projects proposed in their first national communications had been funded.</p>
      <p>Chair Stoycheva said Sok Appadu (Mauritius) would chair a contact group on the issue. Work of the Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I national communications (CGE): CGE Chair Brian Challenger (Antigua and Barbuda) presented a report of the CGE meeting in May 2004.</p>
      <p>He said the CGE would prioritize thematic hands-on training workshops.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND said the effectiveness of these workshops could be improved by, inter alia, identifying specific issues and objectives in consultation with participating countries.</p>
      <p>Chair Stoycheva said she would prepare draft conclusions on the issue.</p>

      <h2>FINANCIAL MECHANISM</h2>
      <p>Matters relating to the implementation of decision 5/CP.8 (review of the financial mechanism): AOSIS, with others, cautioned that the COPs role in providing guidance to the GEF is being 'undermined' by recent developments in the GEF Council.</p>
      <p>ARGENTINA stressed the importance of accelerating the financial needs assessment under the UNFCCC prior to discussions on the next GEF replenishment.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND said the assessment could not be conducted in time for the negotiations on the next GEF replenishment.</p>
      <p>Chair Stoycheva requested Andrea Albán (Colombia) and Sarah Hendry (UK) to hold information consultations on the issue.</p>

      <h2>Small-scale afforestation and reforestation (A&amp;R) under the CDM</h2>
      <p>The EU said simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale A&amp;R are a means to facilitate local participation and reduce transaction costs.</p>
      <p>PERU, with several Latin American Parties, said that at US$ 6 per ton of CO2, small-scale A&amp;R projects would not benefit from CDM, given high transaction costs.</p>
      <p>BOLIVIA said that such projects may be the only way to involve local and indigenous peoples in 'proactive' climate action and urged innovative procedures to advance projects. CHINA, supported by BRAZIL and MALAYSIA, urged Parties not to revisit definitions agreed on at COP-9.</p>

      <p>PALAU noted the merit of granting the Ramsar Convention full membership at the JLG.</p>
