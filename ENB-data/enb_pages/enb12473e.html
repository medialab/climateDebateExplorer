      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small>HISTORY</small>
      <p>The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992, which sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994 and now has 194 parties.</p>
      <p>In December 1997, delegates at the third Conference of the Parties (COP 3) in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission reduction targets.</p>
      <p>These countries, known as Annex I parties under the UNFCCC, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying country by country.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and now has 190 parties.</p>
      <p>In 2005, the first Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 1), held in Montréal, Canada, established the AWG-KP on the basis of Protocol Article 3.9, which mandates consideration of Annex I parties further commitments at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period.</p>
      <p>In addition, COP 11 agreed in Montréal to consider long-term cooperation under the Convention through a series of four workshops known as the Convention Dialogue, which continued until COP 13.</p>

      <h2>UN HIGH-LEVEL ADVISORY GROUP ON CLIMATE CHANGE FINANCING:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>This group held its second meeting from 12-13 July in New York.</p>
      <p>The Group continued to identify long-term financing sources for developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p>
      <p>It will provide its final recommendations in October 2010.</p>

      <h2>CONFERENCE OF AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>This meeting took place in Kampala, Uganda, from 24-25 July 2010.</p>
      <p>Delegates supported a fair and equitable outcome from climate negotiations and adopted a proposal on Streamlining African Climate Change Negotiating Structure at the Ministers and Experts Levels.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12473e_12">
      <h2>FOURTH BASIC MINISTERIAL COORDINATION MEETING:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>This gathering of ministers from the BASIC group (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 25-26 July.</p>
      <p>In a joint statement, ministers urged detailed and comprehensive information on fast-start financing flows from developed countries.</p>
      <p>They also differentiated between measuring, reporting and verifying (MRV) emission reduction commitments by developed countries (which they said relate to compliance and comparability), with the MRV of nationally-appropriate mitigation actions by developing countries (which relate to transparency).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12473e_13">
      <h2>PRE-SESSIONAL WORKSHOP ON FOREST MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>This workshop, which was requested by AWG-KP 12, took place on 30 July in Bonn.</p>
      <p>The event focused on proposed options for forest management accounting, including the numerical implications of the use of reference levels, and the mechanisms for a possible review process.</p>

      <h2>BALI ROADMAP:</h2>
      <p>COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 took place in December 2007 in Bali, Indonesia.</p>
      <p>Negotiations resulted in the adoption of the Bali Action Plan (decision 1/CP.13), which established the AWG-LCA with a mandate to focus on key elements of long-term cooperation identified during the Convention Dialogue: mitigation, adaptation, finance, as well as technology and capacity building.</p>
      <p>The Bali conference also resulted in agreement on a two-year process, the Bali Roadmap, which established two negotiating tracks under the Convention and the Protocol and set a deadline for concluding the negotiations at COP 15 and COP/MOP 5 in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12473e_3">
      <h2>FROM BALI TO COPENHAGEN:</h2>
      <p>In 2008, the two AWGs held four parallel negotiating sessions: April in Bangkok, Thailand; June in Bonn, Germany; August in Accra, Ghana; and December in PoznaÅ, Poland.</p>
      <p>In 2009, the AWGs met in April, June and August in Bonn, Germany; October in Bangkok, Thailand; November in Barcelona, Spain; and December in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12473e_4">
      <h2>AWG-LCA :</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>For the AWG-LCA, the first part of 2009 focused on developing draft negotiating text.</p>
      <p>This process resulted in a text that was nearly 200 pages long and covered all the main elements of the Bali Action Plan.</p>
      <p>Because of the length of the text, delegates started to produce non-papers, reading guides, tables and matrices aimed at making the negotiating text more manageable.</p>
      <p>The outcome was a series of non-papers, forwarded to Copenhagen as an annex to the meeting report.</p>
      <p>Heading into Copenhagen, many felt the AWG-LCA had made satisfactory progress on adaptation, technology and capacity building but that deep divides remained on mitigation and certain aspects of finance.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12473e_5">
      <h2>AWG-KP:</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>For the AWG-KP, the focus in 2009 was on the numbers, namely Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions beyond 2012, when the Protocol s first commitment period expires.</p>
      <p>Parties also discussed other issues in the AWG-KP s work programme, including the flexible mechanisms, LULUCF, and potential consequences of response measures to climate change.</p>
      <p>The discussions were based on documentation divided into proposals for amendments to the Protocol under Article 3.9 (Annex I parties further commitments) and text on other issues, such as LULUCF and the flexible mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Most felt that insufficient progress had been made on Annex I parties aggregate and individual targets, and differences also surfaced between developed and developing countries concerning whether the outcome from Copenhagen should be an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol or a single new agreement under both AWGs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12473e_6">
      <h2>COPENHAGEN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE:</h2>
      <p>The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, took place from 7-19 December 2009, and included COP 15 and COP/MOP 5, the 31st sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), as well as AWG-KP 10 and AWG-LCA 8.</p>
      <p>Over 110 world leaders attended the joint COP and COP/MOP high-level segment from 16-18 December.</p>
      <p>The event was marked by disputes over transparency and process.</p>
      <p>In particular, differences emerged on whether work should be conducted in a small Friends of the Chair format or open contact groups.</p>
      <p>A proposal by the Danish COP Presidency to table two texts reflecting the work done by the AWGs also caused divisions.</p>
      <p>Many parties rejected the Danish text, urging that only texts developed in the AWGs by parties should be used.</p>
      <p>During the high-level segment, informal negotiations took place in a group consisting of major economies and representatives of regional and other negotiating groups.</p>
      <p>Late on Friday evening on 18 December, these talks finally resulted in a political agreement: the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>After the Accord had been agreed by this group, delegates from all parties reconvened for the closing COP plenary.</p>
      <p>Over the next 13 hours, they discussed the transparency of the process and debated whether the COP should adopt the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>Many supported its adoption as a COP decision in order to operationalize it as a step towards securing a better future agreement.</p>
      <p>However, some developing countries opposed the Accord, which they felt had been reached through an untransparent and undemocratic process.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, parties agreed that the COP takes note of the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>Parties also established a process for indicating their support for the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>By 29 July 2010, 137 countries had indicated their support for the Accord.</p>
      <p>More than 80 have also provided information on their emissions reduction targets and other mitigation actions, as agreed under the Accord.</p>
      <p>On the last day of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, the COP and COP/MOP also agreed to extend the mandates of the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP, requesting them to present their respective outcomes to COP 16 and COP/MOP 6 in Cancún.</p>

      <h2>BONN CLIMATE TALKS (April and June 2010)</h2>
      <p>Negotiations resumed in 2010 with AWG-LCA 9 and AWG-KP 11, which took place from 9-11 April.</p>
      <p>Their focus was on the organization and methods of work in 2010 to enable each AWG to fulfill its mandate and report its outcome in Cancún.</p>
      <p>In the AWG-LCA, delegates mandated their Chair to prepare text for the June session.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP agreed to continue considering Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions, as well as various other issues.</p>
      <p>Discussions continued in Bonn from 31 May to 11 June.</p>
      <p>This event included AWG-LCA 10 and AWG-KP 12, as well as the 32nd sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies.</p>
      <p>The SBSTA meeting was noteworthy for a dispute over a proposal for a technical paper on options for limiting global average temperature increase to 1.5°C and 2°C from pre-industrial levels.</p>
      <p>The proposal from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) garnered widespread support, but was blocked by Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar. AWG-LCA 10 focused on the Chair s new draft text.</p>
      <p>Late on 10 June, AWG-LCA Chair Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe) circulated the advance draft of a revised text, which she said could be considered by AWG-LCA 11.</p>
      <p>Some developing countries felt that the advance draft was unbalanced and should not be used as the basis for negotiations in August unless their views were reflected more fully.</p>
      <p>A revised version of the text was circulated in July. AWG-KP 12 focused on Annex I emission reductions and the underlying assumptions for using the flexible mechanisms and LULUCF in the post-2012 period.</p>
      <p>They also addressed ways to avoid a gap between the first and subsequent commitment periods, and requested the Secretariat to prepare a paper on legal options.</p>

      <h2>G-20 SUMMIT:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>The G-20 Summit took place in Toronto, Canada, from 26-27 June.</p>
      <p>The Summit s declaration reaffirmed support for the Copenhagen Accord from those who had previously agreed to it and called for others to associate themselves with it.</p>
      <p>It also included support for a successful outcome at COP 16 and an inclusive process.</p>

    <div id="section_enb12473e_9">
      <h2>SEVENTH LEADERS MEETING OF THE MAJOR ECONOMIES FORUM ON ENERGY AND CLIMATE:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>This event took place in Rome, Italy, from 30 June to 1 July.</p>
      <p>Participants stressed the need to implement the Copenhagen Accord s fast-start financing provisions in a quick and a transparent manner.</p>
      <p>They also discussed whether targets and actions included in the Copenhagen Accord could be reflected in a future outcome, whether such an outcome would be legally binding, and if it should be contained in one instrument or two.</p>
