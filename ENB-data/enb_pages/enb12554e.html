    <h1>Earth Negotiations Bulletin: AWGs</h1>

      <h2>Finance</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Delegates continued discussions on a new note by the AWG-LCA Chair, which elaborates various options for the following issues: continuity of climate finance during the period between 2013 and 2020; fast-start finance; MRV; and arrangements between the GCF and the COP.</p>
      <p>Regarding arrangements between the GCF and the COP, delegates addressed: whether the GEF provided a good model; ensuring proper dialogue between the GCF and the COP; and providing the Standing Committee with guidance to develop arrangements for the GCF.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA said this is not the proper place for discussions on this issue.</p>
      <p>BARBADOS said a decision should be taken in relation to the GCF host, arrangements between the COP and the GCF, and initial capitalization to provide some degree of certainty.</p>
      <p>On continuity of climate financing during the period 2013-2020, some developing countries asked for elaboration of reassurances by developed countries.</p>
      <p>The US distinguished between providing reassurance about continuity of finance after 2012 and having a numerical target, noting that his country was scaling-up financing.</p>
      <p>While commending work being undertaken, COLOMBIA said that this did not provide adequate reassurance that the US$100 billion target would be met.</p>

      <h2>Second Commitment period</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Parties continued discussions on the transition to the second commitment period, facilitated by a non-paper by AWG-KP Vice-Chair Uosukainen.</p>
      <p>The non-paper, entitled possible elements for a decision adopting the Kyoto Protocol amendments, is comprised of parties proposals on: a preamble; adoption of the amendments contained in the annex to the decision; urging parties to ratify the amendments in an expedited manner, with a view to facilitating their prompt entry into force; provisional application; any additional language related to legal continuity; operational and technical continuity; and any outstanding consequential revisions of the previous CMP decisions, including by linking to any outstanding work under the SBSTA; and other.</p>
      <p>Many parties called for a revised draft text consolidating parties proposals to be produced in Bangkok.</p>
      <p>Several parties also underscored the need for decisions that ensure technical and operational continuation of the flexibility mechanisms in 2013.</p>
      <p>Numbers/Text: In the afternoon, parties in the spin-off group discussed a non-paper presented by the co-facilitators on proposed amendments to the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>Delegates exchanged views on: which body should conduct the review of the second commitment period; the relationship of the second commitment period review and the 2015 Review; and the need for more political discussions at the pre-COP.</p>
      <p>Some parties expressed difficulties with moving forward with the review issue in Bangkok.</p>
      <p>BRAZIL proposed an amendment that will enable parties to raise the level of ambition of their commitments, at any time they wish to do so, with immediate effect under international law.</p>
      <p>The co-facilitators said that the non-paper still requires technical work and input from parties, but will offer a structured starting point for Doha.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>working group — corridors</small>
      <p>As the Bangkok climate talks wind down, delegates and observers have been adopting a variety of innovative approaches to navigating the informal status of these talks, circulating rough notes with bullet points, informal notes with headings that foreshadow possible decision text to be added, and discussion questions to encourage focus on the pertinent issues, while refraining from solidifying actual text.</p>
      <p>Some observers felt that a greater degree of convergence is occurring, while others struggled with the semantics of referring to text that technically, as yet, does not exist.</p>
      <p>One delegate prefaced his remarks to the facilitator of his group with, Thanks for the non-paper, with these non-bullets, that have a non-status, I think everybody understands that-¦ While the agenda reflected a full day of various informal discussions, at least one scheduled meeting, on adaptation, did not take place, as participants reportedly could not envisage that further discussions at this point would be productive.</p>
      <p>Informal pieces of text, meanwhile, are quietly making the hand-to-hand rounds, and circulating from one email queue to another.</p>
      <p>The real action, said a veteran of the process, was occurring today in the bilaterals and in hallway huddles.</p>
      <p>Some delegates involved in the Kyoto Protocol discussions observed that more progress has been made in the last five days in Bangkok, than in the two weeks in Bonn, noting the non-status of the Bangkok talks has provided a space for developing a structure and approach to resolving the issues that could be satisfactory to all concerned.</p>
      <p>Wednesday s sessions, some said, will reveal what processes will be undertaken in the space between now and Doha.</p>
