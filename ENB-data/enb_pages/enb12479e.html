      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small>HISTORY</small>
      <p>The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992, which sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994 and now has 194 parties.</p>
      <p>In December 1997, delegates to the third session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 3) in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission reduction targets.</p>
      <p>These countries, known as Annex I parties under the UNFCCC, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and now has 192 parties.</p>
      <p>In 2005, the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 1), held in Montreal, Canada, established the AWG-KP on the basis of Protocol Article 3.9, which mandates consideration of Annex I parties further commitments at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period.</p>
      <p>In addition, COP 11 agreed in Montreal to consider long-term cooperation under the Convention through a series of four workshops known as the Convention Dialogue, which continued until COP 13.</p>

      <h2>BALI ROADMAP:</h2>
      <p>COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 took place in December 2007 in Bali, Indonesia.</p>
      <p>Negotiations resulted in the adoption of the Bali Action Plan (BAP), which established the AWG-LCA with a mandate to focus on key elements of long-term cooperation identified during the Convention Dialogue: mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology transfer.</p>
      <p>The Bali conference also resulted in agreement on a two-year process, the Bali Roadmap, which established two negotiating tracks under the Convention and the Protocol, and set a deadline for concluding the negotiations at COP 15 and COP/MOP 5 in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12479e_3">
      <h2>FROM BALI TO COPENHAGEN:</h2>
      <p>In 2008, the two AWGs held four parallel negotiating sessions in: April in Bangkok, Thailand; June in Bonn, Germany; August in Accra, Ghana; and December in PoznaÅ, Poland.</p>
      <p>In 2009, the AWGs met in: April, June and August in Bonn, Germany; October in Bangkok, Thailand; November in Barcelona, Spain; and December in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12479e_4">
      <h2>AWG-LCA:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>For the AWG-LCA, the first part of 2009 focused on developing draft negotiating text.</p>
      <p>This process resulted in a text that was nearly 200 pages long and covered all the main elements of the BAP.</p>
      <p>Because of the length of the text, delegates began producing non-papers, reading guides, tables and matrices aimed at making the negotiating text more manageable.</p>
      <p>The outcome was a series of non-papers, forwarded to Copenhagen as an annex to the meeting report.</p>
      <p>Heading into Copenhagen, many felt the AWG-LCA had made satisfactory progress on adaptation, technology and capacity building, but that deep divides remained on mitigation and certain aspects of finance.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12479e_5">
      <h2>AWG-KP:</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>For the AWG-KP, the focus in 2009 was on the numbers, namely Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions beyond 2012, when the Protocol s first commitment period expires.</p>
      <p>Parties also discussed other issues in the AWG-KP s work programme, including the flexibility mechanisms, LULUCF and potential consequences of response measures to climate change.</p>
      <p>The discussions were based on documentation divided into proposals for amendments to the Protocol under Article 3.9 and text on other issues, such as LULUCF and the flexibility mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Most felt that insufficient progress had been made on Annex I parties aggregate and individual targets, and differences also surfaced between developed and developing countries concerning whether the outcome from Copenhagen should be an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol or a single new agreement under both AWGs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12479e_6">
      <h2>COPENHAGEN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE:</h2>
      <p>The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, took place from 7-19 December 2009, and included COP 15 and COP/MOP 5, the 31st sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), as well as AWG-KP 10 and AWG-LCA 8.</p>
      <p>Over 110 world leaders attended the joint COP and COP/MOP high-level segment from 16-18 December.</p>
      <p>The event was marked by disputes over transparency and process.</p>
      <p>In particular, differences emerged on whether work should be conducted in a small Friends of the Chair format or open contact groups.</p>
      <p>A proposal by the Danish COP Presidency to table two texts reflecting the work done by the AWGs also caused divisions.</p>
      <p>Many parties rejected the Danish text, urging that only texts developed in the AWGs by parties should be used.</p>
      <p>During the high-level segment, informal negotiations took place in a group consisting of major economies and representatives of regional and other negotiating groups.</p>
      <p>Late in the evening of 18 December, these talks resulted in a political agreement: the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>After the Accord had been agreed on by this small group, delegates from all parties reconvened for the closing COP plenary.</p>
      <p>Over the next 13 hours, they discussed the transparency of the process and debated whether the COP should adopt the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>Many supported adopting it as a COP decision in order to operationalize it as a step towards securing a better future agreement.</p>
      <p>However, some developing countries opposed the Accord, which they felt had been reached through an untransparent and undemocratic process.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, parties agreed that the COP takes note of the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>Parties also established a process for indicating their support for the Accord and, by 3 October 2010, 139 countries had indicated their support.</p>
      <p>More than 80 countries have also provided information on their emission reduction targets and other mitigation actions, as agreed under the Accord.</p>
      <p>On the last day of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, the COP and COP/MOP also agreed to extend the mandates of the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP, requesting them to present their respective outcomes to COP 16 and COP/MOP 6 in Cancun. BONN CLIMATE CHANGE TALKS (APRIL AND JUNE 2010): Negotiations resumed in 2010 with AWG-LCA 9 and AWG-KP 11, which took place from 9-11 April.</p>
      <p>Their focus was on the organization and methods of work in 2010 to enable each AWG to fulfill its mandate and report its outcome in Cancun.</p>
      <p>In the AWG-LCA, delegates mandated the Chair to prepare text for the June session.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP agreed to continue considering Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions, as well as various other issues.</p>
      <p>Discussions continued in Bonn from 31 May to 11 June.</p>
      <p>AWG-LCA 10 focused on the Chair s new draft text.</p>
      <p>Late in the evening of 10 June, AWG-LCA Chair Mukahanana-Sangarwe circulated the advance draft of a revised text, which she said could be considered at AWG-LCA 11.</p>
      <p>Some developing countries felt that the advance draft was unbalanced and should not be used as the basis for negotiations in August unless their views were reflected more fully.</p>
      <p>A revised version of the text was circulated in July. AWG-KP 12 focused on Annex I emission reductions and other issues, including the flexibility mechanisms and LULUCF.</p>
      <p>It also addressed ways to avoid a gap between the first and subsequent commitment periods, and requested the Secretariat to prepare a paper on legal options for achieving this. BONN CLIMATE CHANGE TALKS (AUGUST 2010): AWG-LCA 11 considered a text circulated by Chair Mukahanana-Sangarwe in July 2010 (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/8).</p>
      <p>The text was intended to facilitate negotiations in preparation for reaching an outcome at COP 16.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP continued consideration of the scale of emission reductions from Annex I parties to the Protocol.</p>
      <p>It also discussed legal issues, including a possible gap between the Protocol s first commitment period (2008-2012) and subsequent commitment periods.</p>
      <p>In addition, delegates addressed LULUCF, the flexibility mechanisms and potential consequences of response measures of climate change.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP agreed to forward a Chair s draft proposal on Annex I parties further commitments (FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/CRP.2) for further discussion in Tianjin.</p>

      <h2>GENEVA DIALOGUE ON CLIMATE FINANCE:</h2>
      <p>From 2-3 September 2010, the Geneva Dialogue on Climate Finance took place in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>At the invitation of Switzerland and Mexico, a group of ministers and government representatives from 46 countries and the European Union, together with the AWG-LCA Chair and the UNFCCC Executive Secretary, met in an informal setting to discuss current themes related to finance in the ongoing UN climate negotiations.</p>
      <p>The issues discussed included finance architecture, the new climate fund, the role of the private sector and sources of long-term finance.</p>
      <p>In their summary, the Co-Chairs of the Dialogue characterized the meeting as positive and identified the need to feed the constructive spirit back to the formal negotiations under the UNFCCC.</p>

      <h2>MAJOR ECONOMIES FORUM ON ENERGY AND CLIMATE:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP — HISTORY</small>
      <p>The Eighth Meeting of the Leaders Representatives of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate took place in New York, US, from 20-21 September 2010, and was attended by officials from 17 major economies, as well as the UN, Barbados, Denmark, Egypt, Singapore and Spain.</p>
      <p>Participants discussed how to advance prospects for a successful outcome at the Cancun Climate Change Conference.</p>
      <p>They recommended that the Tianjin negotiations should focus on key issues and extract from the negotiating text what should be decided upon in Cancun.</p>
