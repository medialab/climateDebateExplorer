      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small>HISTORY</small>
      <p>The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, which sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994 and now has 194 parties.</p>
      <p>In December 1997, delegates at COP 3 in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission reduction targets.</p>
      <p>These countries, known as Annex I parties under the UNFCCC, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and now has 191 parties.</p>
      <p>In 2005, the first Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 1), held in Montréal, Canada, established the AWG-KP on the basis of Protocol Article 3.9, which mandates consideration of Annex I parties further commitments at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period.</p>
      <p>In addition, COP 11 agreed in Montréal to consider long-term cooperation under the Convention through a series of four workshops known as the Convention Dialogue, which continued until COP 13.</p>

      <h2>BALI ROADMAP:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 took place in December 2007 in Bali, Indonesia.</p>
      <p>The focus of the Bali Conference was on long-term issues.</p>
      <p>These negotiations resulted in the adoption of the Bali Action Plan (decision 1/CP.13), which established the AWG-LCA with a mandate to focus on key elements of long-term cooperation identified during the Convention Dialogue: mitigation, adaptation, finance, as well as technology and capacity building.</p>
      <p>The Bali Action Plan (BAP) contains a non-exhaustive list of issues to be considered under each of these areas and calls for articulating a shared vision for long-term cooperative action.</p>
      <p>The Bali conference also resulted in agreement on a two-year process, the Bali Roadmap, which covers negotiation tracks under the Convention and the Protocol and set a deadline for concluding the negotiations at COP 15 and COP/MOP 5, held in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
      <p>The two key bodies under the Bali Roadmap are the AWG-LCA and the AWG-KP.</p>

      <h2>FROM BALI TO COPENHAGEN:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In 2008, the two AWGs held four parallel negotiation sessions in: April in Bangkok, Thailand; June in Bonn, Germany; August in Accra, Ghana; and December in Poznán, Poland.</p>
      <p>In 2009, the AWGs convened for parallel sessions: in April, June and August in Bonn, Germany; October in Bangkok, Thailand; November in Barcelona, Spain; and December in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4">
      <h2>AWG-LCA :</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>For the AWG-LCA, the first part of 2009 focused on developing draft negotiating text.</p>
      <p>At AWG-LCA 6 in June, parties clarified and developed their ideas, using a Chair s draft (FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/8) as a starting point.</p>
      <p>This process resulted in a text (FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/INF.1) that was nearly 200 pages long and covered all the main elements of the BAP.</p>
      <p>During its informal session in August, the AWG-LCA first held consultations on how to proceed with the text and then began to produce non-papers, as well as reading guides, tables and matrices (FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/INF.2) aimed at making the negotiating text more manageable.</p>
      <p>Convening in Bangkok and Barcelona, AWG-LCA 7 continued streamlining and consolidating the negotiating text.</p>
      <p>The outcome was a series of non-papers, forwarded to Copenhagen as an annex to the meeting report (FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/14).</p>
      <p>Going to Copenhagen, many felt that the AWG-LCA had made satisfactory progress on issues such as adaptation, technology and capacity building but that deep divides persisted on mitigation and certain aspects of finance.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_5">
      <h2>AWG-KP:</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>For the AWG-KP, the focus in 2009 was on the numbers, namely, Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions beyond 2012, when the Protocol s first commitment period expires.</p>
      <p>Parties also continued discussing other issues in the AWG-KP s work programme, including: the flexibility mechanisms; land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF); and potential consequences of response measures.</p>
      <p>The discussions were based on documentation divided into proposals for amendments to the Protocol under Article 3.9 (Annex I parties further commitments) and text on other issues, such as LULUCF and the flexibility mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Most felt that no significant progress was made on Annex I parties aggregate and individual targets, and differences also surfaced between developed and developing countries concerning whether the outcome from Copenhagen should be an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol or a single new agreement under both AWGs.</p>
      <p>By June 2009, the Secretariat had received five submissions from parties for a new protocol under the Convention, and twelve submissions concerning amendments to the Kyoto Protocol for consideration by COP 15 and COP/MOP 5, respectively, in Copenhagen.</p>

      <h2>COPENHAGEN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, took place from 7-19 December 2009.</p>
      <p>It included: COP 15 and COP/MOP 5, held in conjunction with the 31st sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies, as well as AWG-KP 10 and AWG-LCA 8.</p>
      <p>What many characterized as intense negotiations took place over the two weeks at the level of experts, Ministers and Heads of State.</p>
      <p>Over 110 world leaders attended the joint COP and COP/MOP high-level segment from 16-18 December.</p>
      <p>Questions concerning transparency and process played out during the meeting.</p>
      <p>Differences emerged, inter alia , on whether work should be carried out in a smaller Friends of the Chair format or in open contact groups.</p>
      <p>A proposal by the Danish COP Presidency to table two texts reflecting the work done by the AWGs also caused divisions.</p>
      <p>Many parties rejected this idea, urging that only texts developed in the AWGs by parties should be used.</p>
      <p>During the high-level segment, informal negotiations took place in a group consisting of major economies and representatives of regional and other negotiating groups.</p>
      <p>Late on Friday evening, these talks resulted in a political agreement entitled the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>During the closing COP plenary, which lasted nearly 13 hours, discussions ensued on the transparency of the process and on whether the COP should adopt the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>Most negotiating groups supported its adoption as a COP decision in order to operationalize it as a step towards a better future agreement.</p>
      <p>Some developing countries, however, opposed the Accord reached during what they characterized as an untransparent and undemocratic negotiating process.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, parties agreed to adopt a COP decision whereby the COP takes note of the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>Parties also established a procedure for countries supporting the Copenhagen Accord to accede to it.</p>
      <p>By May 2010, 130 countries indicated their support for the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>Forty-two Annex I countries and 37 non-Annex I countries have also provided information on their emission reduction targets and other mitigation actions, as agreed under the Accord.</p>
      <p>On the last day of the Copenhagen Climate Conference, the COP and COP/MOP also agreed to extend the mandates of the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP, requesting them to present their respective outcomes to COP 16 and COP/MOP 6, which will convene in Cancún, Mexico for two weeks beginning on 29 November 2010.</p>

      <h2>AWG-LCA 9 AND AWG-KP 11:</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>From 9-11 April 2010, AWG-LCA 9 and AWG-KP 11 convened in Bonn, Germany.</p>
      <p>Their focus was on the organization and methods of work in 2010 to enable each AWG to fulfill its mandate and report its outcome in Cancún.</p>
      <p>The AWG-LCA agreed, inter alia , to mandate its Chair to prepare text, under her own responsibility, for the June session drawing on the AWG-LCA report to COP 15, as well as work undertaken by the COP on the basis of that report.</p>
      <p>The AWG-LCA also agreed to invite parties to submit additional views by late April, which the Chair may draw upon in preparing her draft negotiating text.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP agreed to continue considering Annex I parties aggregate and individual emission reductions, as well as the other issues.</p>
      <p>It mandated the Chair to prepare documentation for the next session.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP also agreed to note that its Chair has undertaken, under his own initiative, to meet with the AWG-LCA Chair to identify information on commitments of Annex I parties, which is to be made available to parties.</p>

      <h2>WORLD PEOPLE S CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE RIGHTS OF MOTHER EARTH:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>The Conference took place from 19-22 April 2010 in Cochabamba, Bolivia, and was attended by more than 35,000 delegates from social movements and organizations from 140 countries.</p>
      <p>It addressed issues including: developed countries climate debt, harmony with nature, Mother Earth s rights, a global referendum on climate change, dangers of the carbon market, climate refugees, adaptation, emission reductions and establishment of a climate justice tribunal.</p>
      <p>The Conference resulted in the People s Agreement of Cochabamba and a draft proposal for a Universal Declaration of Mother Earth s Rights, which were developed and submitted to the AWG-LCA by Bolivia (FCCC/AWGLCA/2010/MISC.2).</p>
      <p>The People s Agreement calls, inter alia, for limiting the average global temperature increase to a maximum of 1°C, with a view to returning temperatures as close as possible to pre-industrial levels in the longer-term.</p>

      <h2>OSLO FOREST CLIMATE CONFERENCE :</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>The Conference took place on 27 May 2010 in Oslo, Norway, where representatives of 50 governments agreed to establish a partnership for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, plus conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+).</p>
      <p>The agreement describes the intent of partner governments to provide a voluntary framework to serve as an interim platform for immediate action in order to scale-up REDD+ actions and finance while negotiations on REDD+ continue under the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>The agreement highlights, inter alia , the inclusion of representatives of relevant stakeholders and establishes an organizational framework, as well as secretariat services, to be provided jointly by the UN and the World Bank.</p>
