      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small>HISTORY</small>
      <p>Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on human health, food security, economic activity, natural resources, physical infrastructure and the environment.</p>
      <p>Global climate varies naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of anthropogenically produced greenhouse gases in the Earths atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate.</p>
      <p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of climate change have already been observed, and scientific findings indicate that precautionary and prompt action is necessary. The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous anthropogenic interference' with the climate system.</p>
      <p>Controlled gases include methane, nitrous oxide and, in particular, carbon dioxide.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now has 189 Parties.</p>
      <p>The Parties to the UNFCCC typically convene once a year in a Conference of the Parties (COP), and twice a year in meetings of the UNFCCCs subsidiary bodies.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_2">
      <h2>THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In December 1997, delegates met at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, and agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed countries and countries making the transition to a market economy (EITs) to achieve quantified emissions reduction targets.</p>
      <p>These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.</p>
      <p>The Protocol also establishes three flexible mechanisms to assist Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets cost-effectively: an emissions trading system; joint implementation (JI) of emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties; and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which allows for projects to be implemented in non-Annex I Parties.</p>
      <p>Following COP-3, Parties initiated negotiations on most of the rules and operational details determining how countries will reduce emissions, and measure and assess emissions reductions.</p>
      <p>To date, 132 Parties have ratified the Protocol, including 37 Annex I Parties, representing 61.6% of 1990 Annex I greenhouse gas emissions, meeting the requirements for entry into force of the Protocol, which will take place on 16 February 2005.</p>
      <p>During COP-10, Pakistan, Egypt, Nigeria, Oman, Indonesia, Lichtenstein and Ukraine also announced their recent or imminent ratifications.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_3">
      <h2>THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) was negotiated at COP-4 in 1998, in order to set out a process for taking forward the provisions of the Protocol.</p>
      <p>The BAPA set COP-6 as the deadline for reaching agreement on the operational details of the Protocol and on strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>In particular, Protocol issues to be addressed included rules relating to the flexible mechanisms, a regime for assessing Parties compliance, accounting methods for national emissions and emissions reductions, and rules on crediting countries for carbon sinks.</p>
      <p>Issues under the UNFCCC that required resolution included questions of capacity building, the development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized countries to combat climate change. Following agreement on the BAPA at COP-4, subsequent meetings attempted to reach agreement on the various elements of the work programme.</p>
      <p>In November 2000, Parties met at COP-6 in The Hague, the Netherlands, and attempted to complete these negotiations without success.</p>
      <p>COP-6 was suspended until July 2001 when it reconvened in Bonn, Germany.</p>
      <p>Delegates held protracted consultations, and finally agreed to adopt a political decision, the Bonn Agreements.</p>
      <p>However, this political decision needed to be operationalized through COP decisions.</p>
      <p>These decisions were considered a 'package,' but since agreement had not been reached on the flexible mechanisms, compliance and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), all draft decisions were forwarded to COP-7.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4">
      <h2>THE MARRAKESH ACCORDS</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Delegates continued discussions on the Bonn Agreements at COP-7 in October/November 2001.</p>
      <p>Following extensive negotiations, the Marrakesh Accords were adopted and have served as the basis for subsequent negotiations.</p>
      <p>The Marrakesh Accords set out building blocks for decisions under the Protocol and UNFCCC, including: the flexible mechanisms and LULUCF; rules for compliance; rules on communicating and reviewing information on emissions and removals of greenhouse gases; and issues relating to support for developing countries, including capacity building, technology transfer, responding to the adverse effects of climate change, and the establishment of three funds - the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and the Adaptation Fund.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_5">
      <h2>MOVE TOWARD IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Delegates met at COP-8 in October/November 2002, and again at COP-9 in December 2003 to negotiate decisions for implementing the Marrakesh Accords.</p>
      <p>Among other things, Parties agreed on rules and procedures for the CDM Executive Board (EB), the body designated to supervise the CDM, and modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation (A&amp;R) activities under the CDM, including small-scale activities for the first commitment period.</p>
      <p>Parties also discussed how to integrate findings of the IPCCs Third Assessment Report into the work of the UNFCCC, agreeing on two new agenda items on adaptation and on mitigation.</p>
      <p>Most recently, delegates met at the twentieth sessions of SBI and SBSTA in June 2004, in Bonn.</p>
      <p>Among other things, SBSTA-20 considered small-scale A&amp;R CDM project activities and good practice guidance (GPG) on LULUCF, and held two in-session workshops on adaptation, and on mitigation.</p>
      <p>SBI-20 addressed the UNFCCCs financial mechanism and arrangements for intergovernmental meetings.</p>

      <h2>COP-10 REPORT</h2>
      <small>COP</small>
      <p>On Monday, 6 December 2004, COP-9 Vice President Mamadou Honadia (Burkina Faso), on behalf of COP-9 President Miklós Persányi (Hungary), introduced Ginés González García, Argentine Minister of Health and the Environment, who was elected President of COP-10 by acclamation.</p>
      <p>President González García emphasized that COP-10 is the final session prior to the Kyoto Protocols entry into force and the first session of a new chapter devoted to taking action.</p>
      <p>He stated that advanced research and knowledge must be accompanied by increased resources, and that commitments from all members of society are needed. Anibal Ibarra, Mayor of Buenos Aires, welcomed participants to Buenos Aires and highlighted the central role of local authorities in responding to climate change and raising public awareness. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter highlighted the tenth anniversary of the UNFCCC and presented a report of the UNFCCCs first decade, underlining the challenges that lie beyond 2012.</p>
      <p>She suggested that Parties consider an equitable and effective future strategy to ensure that all countries contribute fairly to achieving the UNFCCCs objectives. Numerous speakers welcomed the Russian Federations ratification of the Protocol and expressed hope that the US would also ratify the Protocol.</p>
      <p>Qatar, on behalf of the G-77/China, noted the impacts of recent climate-related disasters on developing countries and emphasized Annex I Parties responsibility for financial resource mobilization for adaptation, stressing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The Netherlands, on behalf of the EU, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, expressed continued commitment to addressing climate change and highlighted the launch of the EU emissions trading scheme in January 2005.</p>
      <p>He supported limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, noting that a greater increase would result in irreversible damages.</p>
      <p>Tuvalu, on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), highlighted the need for strong linkages with the 10-year review of the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (BPOA+10) and the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR), both to be held in January 2005, and emphasized the importance of dialogue on adaptation. Noting that the first commitment period is only an initial step, Switzerland, for the Environmental Integrity Group, urged Parties to consider the format for discussions on addressing climate change beyond 2012.</p>
      <p>Kenya, for the Africa Group, stressed the need for progress on the implementation of decision 5/CP.7 (adverse effects).</p>
      <p>Tanzania, for the LDCs, expressed concern at the slow disbursement of funds for the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs).</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia said that targets for the second commitment period should be limited to Annex B Parties, and should not include developing country Parties. On Friday, 17 December, President González García said that the following nominations had been received for COP Vice-President: Jawad Ali Khan (Pakistan); Ahmed Majid Al-Naqbi (United Arab Emirates); Nikolai Pomoshnikov (Russian Federation); Jacek Mizak (Poland); Bruno Sekoli (Lesotho); Beat Nobs (Switzerland); and Masao Nakayama (Micronesia).</p>
      <p>Thomas Becker (Denmark) was elected as SBI Chair, replacing Daniela Stoycheva (Bulgaria), who completed her term at the end of SBI-21.</p>
      <p>Sylvia McGill (Jamaica) served as COP Rapporteur. During COP-10, Parties met in COP Plenary sessions on Monday, 6 December, Wednesday, 8 December, Friday, 17 December, and closed on Saturday, 18 December.</p>
      <p>A high-level segment took place on Wednesday and Thursday, 15-16 December, and included four panel discussions.</p>
      <p>SBI and SBSTA opened on Monday, 6 December, and continued meeting in formal sessions, contact groups and informal sessions through Wednesday, 15 December.</p>
      <p>This report summarizes the issues discussed at COP-10, organized in accordance with the agendas of the SBSTA, SBI and COP.</p>

      <h2>SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE</h2>
      <small>SBSTA</small>
      <p>SBSTA Chair Abdullatif Benrageb (Libya) opened SBSTA-21 on Monday, 6 December, noting that Arther Rolle (Bahamas) will continue to serve as SBSTA Vice-Chair and Ibrahim Al-Ajmi (Oman) as Rapporteur.</p>
      <p>Delegates adopted the agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/7).</p>
      <p>SBSTA met on Monday, 6 December, Tuesday, 7 December and Friday, 10 December, and closed on Wednesday morning, 15 December.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_8">
      <h2>SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC ASPECTS OF IMPACTS OF, AND VULNERABILITY AND ADAPTATION TO, CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>This issue was first addressed by SBSTA on Thursday, 9 December.</p>
      <p>Most countries said the SBSTA in-session workshop held on Wednesday, 8 December, had highlighted the urgency for action to address adaptation, and that adaptation should be a global priority.</p>
      <p>The US said that individual extreme weather events cannot be linked to climate change.</p>
      <p>The EU recommended reviewing the outcomes of the SBSTA-20 and SBSTA-21 workshops to identify impacts of different levels and rates of climate change, and adaptation options.</p>
      <p>Some countries called for, inter alia, strengthening the adaptation knowledge-base, promoting public participation, mobilizing funds and technology transfer, and strengthening links with other conventions. A contact group co-chaired by Philip Gwage (Uganda) and David Warrilow (UK) met on Thursday, 9 December, to draft conclusions on this issue since there was insufficient time for a decision at COP-10.</p>
      <p>Many delegates called for transfer of adaptation technology, and support for the development and use of indigenous and local technologies, and said adaptation should be included in sustainable development plans.</p>
      <p>On Monday, 13 December, delegates considered draft conclusions prepared by the Co-Chairs and an Argentine proposal to adopt a work programme on adaptation.</p>
      <p>The proposal outlined elements for a work programme on adaptation that seeks to, inter alia, address the domestic measures that Parties should take to adapt to climate change and climate variability.</p>
      <p>It proposes elements for a work programme such as work on data and methodologies, vulnerability assessment, adaptation planning, integration of adaptation into sustainable development, and adaptation actions.</p>
      <p>The Africa Group supported the proposal and suggested including the results of the SBSTA-21 in-session workshops.</p>
      <p>Many Parties suggested including the proposal in SBSTAs conclusions on adaptation.</p>
      <p>Australia, supported by the EU, noted that the programme itself and its detailed activities could be adopted at a later stage. Following a series of closed informal consultations, the SBSTA plenary was informed on Tuesday, 14 December, that details had not yet been resolved on the proposed adaptation work programme and how to relate this agenda item to the SBI item on implementation of decision 5/CP.7.</p>
      <p>SBSTA amended the draft conclusions to account for the lack of consensus on adaptation issues and forwarded them to the COP President for further consideration.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, 18 December, COP Vice-President Nikolai Pomoshnikov said the results of these discussions were incorporated into the decision on the Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures (FCCC/CP/2004/L.16), under the agenda item on the implementation of decision 5/CP.7 (See page 10).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_9">
      <h2>SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC ASPECTS OF MITIGATION</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>This issue was first addressed by SBSTA on Friday, 10 December, and subsequently in three contact group meetings co-chaired by Kok Seng Yap (Malaysia) and Toshiyuki Sakamoto (Japan).</p>
      <p>SBSTA adopted conclusions in plenary on Tuesday, 14 December. Many Parties welcomed the in-session workshop held on Thursday, 9 December, on practical opportunities and solutions for mitigation that contribute to sustainable development and technology innovation, deployment and diffusion, and supported holding additional in-session workshops at future SBSTA sessions.</p>
      <p>Discussions in the contact group addressed, inter alia, possible presentation topics for future in-session workshops.</p>
      <p>Opposed by many Parties, the EU proposed consideration of 'elements of a future work programme' at SBSTA-23. On Tuesday, 14 December, Contact Group Co-Chair Sakamoto introduced the draft conclusions, explaining that during informal consultations, Parties agreed to remove brackets on text inviting Parties to submit their views on lessons learned from the mitigation workshops and any future steps under this agenda item.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_10">
      <h2>SBSTA Conclusions</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.27), SBSTA, inter alia, agrees to continue focusing its work on exchanging information and sharing experiences and views among Parties on practical opportunities and solutions to facilitate implementation of the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>SBSTA requests the Secretariat to organize an in-session workshop at SBSTA-22, focusing on: factors that affect mitigation technology innovation, deployment and diffusion, including international cooperative efforts and removal of barriers; and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation, such as costs and benefits, co-benefits, poverty reduction, and economic impacts, including spillover effects. SBSTA invites Parties to submit their views on the organization of the in-session workshop, on lessons learned from previous mitigation workshops, and any future steps under this agenda item, and requests the Secretariat to compile these submissions to facilitate the ongoing consideration of these topics at SBSTA-23.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_11">
      <h2>METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Good practice guidance for LULUCF activities under the Protocol, harvested wood products (HWP) and other issues relating to LULUCF: This issue was first addressed in the SBSTA plenary on Monday, 6 December, and subsequently in a contact group co-chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana), which met five times from 6-13 December.</p>
      <p>Informal consultations were also held in an effort to draft conclusions and negotiate a draft decision for adoption at COP-10.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, 14 December, SBSTA adopted conclusions on this matter and on Friday, 17 December, the COP adopted the decision, including a draft COP/MOP decision The contact group addressed the IPCC good practice guidance (GPG) under the Protocol, the issue of harvested wood products, and other matters relating to LULUCF.</p>
      <p>At SBSTA-20, delegates had not been able to reach agreement on, inter alia, the methods for accounting GPG, while the common reporting format tables had been agreed on, except with regard to the identification of LULUCF activities in relation to Protocol Article 6 (JI) and the coding system to be used for identifying activities in relation to JI projects. In the first meeting of the contact group, Co-Chair Rosland, supported by the EU, Canada and Japan, and opposed by the G-77/China, proposed removing all brackets in the draft negotiating text forwarded from SBSTA-20 and deleting the option on the common reporting format referring to Protocol Article 6.</p>
      <p>Following informal consultations, Parties agreed on a revised draft decision text that stipulates that GPG will be applied in a manner 'consistent' with the Marrakesh Accords, and includes a footnote stating that reporting methods contained in the GPG should ensure that land areas subject to LULUCF activities under Articles 3.3 (afforestation, reforestation and deforestation) and 3.4 (additional activities) can be identified. On HWP, Parties could not agree on how the IPCC should develop methods to estimate, measure and report on HWP in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. On LULUCF matters, Australia, supported by Canada and Japan, tabled a written proposal for an open-ended policy dialogue.</p>
      <p>Australia, with the US, Canada and the EU, and opposed by the G-77/China and AOSIS, supported addressing the issue of 'factoring out' direct human-induced effects from the indirect and natural effects of LULUCF activities.</p>
      <p>Parties did not reach consensus on this matter, but agreed on a paragraph relating to the possible application of biome-specific forest definitions. On Tuesday 14 December, SBSTA adopted conclusions on GPG, HWP and other LULUCF issues and forwarded a draft decision on GPG to the COP, including a draft COP/MOP decision.</p>
      <p>The conclusions were adopted by the COP on Friday, 17 December.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_12">
      <h2>SBSTA Conclusions</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In the conclusions on LULUCF (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.26), SBSTA takes note of the information contained in the document relating to LULUCF projects under Protocol Article 6 (joint implementation).</p>
      <p>On HWP, SBSTA takes note, inter alia, of the IPCCs work on developing methods to estimate, measure, and report on HWP in the context of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and the intent of the IPCC to develop, for the purpose of compiling greenhouse gas inventories under the UNFCCC, methods that are neutral in relation to potential accounting approaches for HWP.</p>
      <p>SBSTA also invites the IPCC to report, on a regular basis, on progress made on this issue. SBSTA also decides to continue the consideration of various impacts of country-level data on production, use, and disposal of HWP at SBSTA-23.</p>
      <p>SBSTA invites Parties that have not done so to provide available data and information on changes in stocks and emissions of greenhouse gases from HWP and to submit updated information on HWP and experiences of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines and GPG to the Secretariat by 1 August 2005.</p>
      <p>SBSTA requests the Secretariat to compile these submissions, and information on HWP contained in previous submissions from Parties specifically on HWP, and in national greenhouse gas inventory reports, for consideration at SBSTA-23.</p>
      <p>SBSTA also agrees to continue deliberation on items relating to factoring out at a future session, noting that a decision on biome-specific definitions is not needed at this stage.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_13">
      <h2>COP Decision</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In the decision on LULUCF (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.26/Add.1), the COP, inter alia, encourages Annex I Parties that have ratified the Protocol to submit, on a voluntary basis, estimates of greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks, using the common reporting format. Small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM: This issue was first addressed by SBSTA in plenary on Monday, 6 December, and subsequently in a contact group co-chaired by Thelma Krug (Brazil) and Jim Penman (UK), which met four times between 7-13 December, Informal consultations were also held in an effort to draft conclusions and negotiate a draft decision for adoption at COP-10. The contact group considered a bracketed annex to the draft conclusions forwarded from SBSTA-20.</p>
      <p>At SBSTA-20, Parties were unable to resolve issues of bundling (clustering small projects to decrease transaction costs), leakage (unintended consequences of activities leading to increasing emissions in an area outside the project boundary), definitions of low-income communities and monitoring. In the opening SBSTA plenary, on Monday, 6 December, the Secretariat presented a proposal for a draft decision on small-scale A&amp;R CDM, and on measures to facilitate their implementation.</p>
      <p>Issues discussed focused on, inter alia: average projected net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks; whether projects will be exempt from, or subject to, paying a lower share of proceeds to the Protocols Adaptation Fund; and reducing rates of the share of project proceeds to cover administrative expenses.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to invite assistance for capacity-building activities for the application and implementation of simplified modalities and procedures.</p>
      <p>Parties informally resolved outstanding issues of bundling, leakage, and monitoring.</p>
      <p>Delegates agreed to forward these draft texts to the SBSTA plenary. On Tuesday, 14 December, the SBSTA plenary adopted conclusions and agreed to forward a draft decision to the COP, which it adopted on Friday, 17 December.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_14">
      <h2>SBSTA Conclusions</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.20), SBSTA notes that the Executive Secretary provided Parties with an indication of administrative and budgetary implications of the draft decision.</p>
      <p>SBSTA also notes that the decision can only be implemented if supplementary funds are available.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_15">
      <h2>COP Decision</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In the decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.26/Add.1), the COP decides, inter alia: to adopt simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale A&amp;R CDM project activities in the first commitment period; to limit small-scale A&amp;R projects to net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks less than eight kilotonnes of carbon dioxide per year if the average projected net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks for each verification period do not exceed eight kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year; if a small-scale project results in excess removals of eight kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, excess removals will not be eligible for the issuance of temporary or long-term certified emissions reductions; and to exempt small-scale project activities from the share of proceeds to be used to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change and shall be entitled to a reduced level of the non-reimbursable fee for requesting registration and a reduced rate of the proceeds to cover administrative expenses of the CDM. The COP also requests, inter alia, that: the CDM EB develop, for consideration by COP/MOP-1, default factors for assessing the existing carbon stocks and for simplified baseline methodologies for small-scale A&amp;R projects, taking into account, if appropriate, types of soil, lifetime of project and climatic conditions.</p>
      <p>The COP invites Parties to provide support to project participants interested in coordinating submission of several project activities, with a view to reducing the costs of validation, verification, and certification.</p>
      <p>The COP also invites relevant multilateral agencies, intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations to participate in preparing these activities. Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transport: This issue was first addressed by SBSTA in plenary on Monday, 6 December, and subsequently in informal consultations facilitated by Eduardo Calvo (Peru).</p>
      <p>Consultations aimed to address collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), methodological issues for the allocation of emissions from international aviation and maritime transport, and the timeline for addressing this issue.</p>

      <p>Many countries welcomed the pledges to the SCCF, but noted that they are insufficient to adequately support efforts on adaptation to climate change and response to disasters.</p>
      <p>AOSIS, the Africa Group, LDCs, and others expressed concern over the interpretation of COP guidance to the GEF, underlining that the most vulnerable countries face difficulty in accessing GEF funds due to the burden of co-financing requirements, the existence of additional criteria and indicators not adopted by the COP, and the narrow scope of adaptation projects eligible under the GEF.</p>
      <p>A contact group, co-chaired by Rawleston Moore (Barbados) and Jozef Buys (Belgium) addressed this issue on Wednesday and Friday, 8 and 10 December, and discussed developing countries concerns about the GEF adding conditions to access the SCCF. Following informal consultations, SBI considered a bracketed draft decision in plenary on Tuesday, 14 December.</p>
      <p>Parties were informed that consensus had not been reached in the contact group, and agreed to forward the draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.25) to the COP Presidency for further consultations.</p>
      <p>The draft decision includes bracketed text referring to the activities that should be funded by the SCCF, such as renewable energy, environmentally sounds technology and development of advanced fuel technology.

    </div>
    <div id="section_63">
      <h2>COP Decision</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The decision (FCCC/CP/2004/L.16), entitled the Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures, is divided into four parts: adverse effects of climate change; impact of the implementation of response measures; further multilateral work relating to activities under decision 5/CP.7; and the SBSTA programme of work on impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change. On adverse effects of climate change, the COP decides to further implementation of actions under decision 5/CP.7 on information and methodologies, and vulnerability and adaptation.</p>
      <p>It requests the GEF to report to COP-11 and subsequent sessions on relevant activities of, inter alia, the LDC Fund and SCCF.</p>
      <p>It also requests the Secretariat to organize, before COP-13, three regional workshops, reflecting regional priorities, and one expert meeting for SIDS, reflecting issues of priority identified by that group.</p>
      <p>Regarding modeling, the COP encourages the IPCC to incorporate regional-specific modeling information on adverse effects of climate change in its Fourth Assessment Report. On reporting, it requests Annex II Parties to provide detailed information on progress made to meet the needs of developing countries arising from the adverse effects of climate change, encourages non-Annex 1 Parties to provide information on their specific needs and concerns arising from the adverse effects of climate change, and requests SBI-27 to, inter alia, consider compilation and synthesis reports of national communications regarding the adverse effects of climate change. On the impact of the implementation of response measures, the decision focuses on progress on implementation, modeling and economic diversification, and reporting.</p>
      <p>Regarding progress on implementation, the COP recalls that decision 5/CP.7 mandates GEF support for response measures.</p>
      <p>On modeling and economic diversification, it requests the Secretariat to organize two expert meetings and that the outcomes be reported to SBI-25.</p>
      <p>On reporting, it requests Annex II Parties to provide information on progress made on support programmes for developing countries, and developing countries to report on needs and concerns arising from the impact of implementation of response measures.</p>

      <h2>Matters relating to the LDCs</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>This issue was first addressed by the SBI, on Monday 6, December.</p>
      <p>LDC Expert Group (LEG) Chair Laavasa Malua (Samoa) presented the LEGs meeting report.</p>
      <p>A contact group chaired by Bubu Jallow (Gambia) and Ricardo Moita (Portugal) met twice between 9-14 December and discussed, inter alia, guidance to the GEF on the LDC Fund, the mandate of the LEG, whether the LDC Fund should begin funding NAPA priority areas, and whether the LDC Fund should leverage additional resources, provide co-financing and build upon existing plans and programmes.</p>
      <p>During these discussions, LDCs expressed concern over GEF co-financing requirements, noting that decision 6/CP.9 (guidance on the operation of the LDC Fund) provides for full funding of NAPAs.</p>
      <p>The EU said co-financing emphasizes countries sense of ownership over projects.</p>
      <p>Agreement could not be reached on all issues.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, 14 December, SBI decided to forward the bracketed draft decisions and conclusions to the COP Presidency. On Saturday, 18 December, draft conclusions and two draft decisions were presented to the COP plenary.</p>
      <p>The decision on further guidance for the operation of the LDC Fund has bracketed text instructing the LDC Fund to start funding other elements of the LDC work programme.</p>
      <p>Canada, Norway, the EU and Switzerland, opposed by many developing countries and LDCs, suggested deleting the text and said that more time is needed to develop the criteria for the LDC Fund before projects can be financed.</p>
      <p>Parties were not able to reach an agreement and the draft decision (FCCC/CP/2004/L.15) was forwarded to SBI-22 for further consideration.</p>
      <p>The COP adopted conclusions on the status of implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.9 (LDCs), and a decision on the mandate for the LEG.</p>

      <p>The International Energy Agency noted that estimates indicate that greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector are still growing robustly and a variety of technologies need to be developed, implemented and managed in a manner that meets energy needs. Noting that 80% of the climate change impacts from refrigerating plants are due to energy consumption, the International Institute of Refrigeration said that efforts are being made to make refrigerators more energy efficient. OPEC said that the adverse effects of policies and measures on OPEC States must be considered, expressed concern about calls for new climate change commitments for developing countries, and stressed that developing countries cannot be expected to prioritize mitigation over other more pressing needs. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said the OECD advocates the use of market-based instruments to reach environmental goals in an economically efficient manner, emphasizing the OECDs ability to bring together economic, social and environmental perspectives for finding solutions. Commending actions taken over the past decade, the Asian-African Group Legal Consultative Organization underlined the need for further action in a spirit of cooperation. The Asian Development Bank noted both the economic strides and environmental degradation experienced by the Asia-Pacific region, stressing that developing countries and aid organizations must ensure that climate change issues are well integrated in their strategies and programmes. Local Governments requested that: CDM and JI rules include local government policies that stimulate market transformation; the UNFCCC acknowledge local government action; and the UNFCCC give local governments special status at future UNFCCC events. The Inuit Circumpolar Conference linked climate change to human rights, and suggested that UNEP facilitate a dialogue among residents of vulnerable areas, such as low-lying countries, small island States and the Arctic. Research and Independent NGOs stressed the need to open a dialogue with policy makers.</p>
      <p>Global Unions supported more ambitious reductions of greenhouse gas emissions as long as civil society representatives are involved in the decision-making process.</p>
      <p>The Business Council for Sustainable Energy stressed the importance of market-based approaches to encourage greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and the need to create opportunities for companies from Protocol non-Parties to participate in the global response to climate change.</p>
      <p>Business and Industry NGOs said climate change solutions must take into account regional and local circumstances.</p>
      <p>Foro del Buen Ayre expressed concern about possible restrictions to civil society participation in the seminars planned for 2005. The Climate Action Network urged the G-77/China to reject the 'roadblocks' erected by Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>The Union of Concerned Scientists, on behalf of the Climate Action Network, said the next negotiation round should concentrate on: further emissions reductions by Annex I Parties; a more rapid deployment of clean technologies in developing countries; and adaptation measures to cope with the impacts of climate change.</p>
      <p>A representative of the Mapuche People highlighted the need to improve participation by indigenous communities in the UNFCCC process.</p>
      <p>The World Council of Churches said 'beyond 2012' negotiations should focus on a principle-based approach concentrating on an equitable allocation of benefits and burdens, precaution, priority for the most vulnerable, and maximum risk reduction.</p>

      <p>COP-10 Vice-President Pomoshnikov introduced the proposal on holding a Seminar of Government Experts back-to-back with SB-22 to, inter alia, promote informal exchanges regarding actions on adaptation and mitigation and P&amp;Ms.</p>
      <p>In the Seminar, all UNFCCC Parties will be entitled to make a presentation.</p>
      <p>Participants may bring to the attention of the Seminar publications offering supplementary data in support of their presentations, and the Secretariat is invited to place the texts of presentations and the supplementary data on its website. India, supported by Saudi Arabia, China, and several other G-77/China Parties and opposed by the EU, Russian Federation, South Africa, AOSIS and several Annex I Parties, suggested that the proposal be amended stating proceedings of the Seminar will be made available by the Secretariat and are not intended to lead to a process for further commitments by developing countries.</p>
      <p>Parties considered compromise proposals made by Oman and Brazil.</p>
      <p>After two rounds of informal discussions, Argentina proposed, and Parties agreed, to add text stating that the proceedings of the Seminar will be made available by the Secretariat to Parties for their consideration, bearing in mind that this Seminar does not open any negotiations leading to new commitments. Parties then addressed the adaptation work programme, which had been added to the decision on implementation of decision 5/CP.7.</p>
      <p>After deliberations on reference to the workshop on insurance- related actions held in May 2003, and the title of the section on the 'SBSTA programme of work on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation,' which Tuvalu requested refer only to climate change, Parties adopted the decision. Finally, Parties discussed the decision on the LDC Fund.</p>
      <p>Following informal consultations and Plenary discussions, Parties were unable to reach agreement, and decided to forward the issue to SBI-22. COP Rapporteur Sylvia McGill presented the report of the session (FCCC/CP/2004/L.1 and Add.1), which Parties adopted. Vice-President Pomoshnikov presented a draft resolution on an expression of gratitude to Argentina and people of city of Buenos Aires (FCCC/CP/2004/L.5), which Parties adopted by acclamation.</p>
      <p>The Gambia, for LDCs, recalled the vulnerability of LDCs to climate change.</p>
      <p>Following additional closing statements thanking Argentina as COP-10 host country, Vice-President Pomoshnikov thanked participants and the Secretariat and gaveled the meeting to a close at 10:57 am on Saturday, 18 December.</p>

      <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE ARCHITECTURE</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The year 2004 was a significant one for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>The year marks the 10th anniversary of the entry into force of the UNFCCC and, as such, many have been looking back with a sense of accomplishment at the progress achieved over the past decade.</p>
      <p>In addition, much of the world celebrated when the Russian Federation ratified the Kyoto Protocol, ensuring the continuity of mitigation efforts into the next decade as the Protocol enters into force in early 2005. To make sure that the 'house' is in order for the Protocols imminent entry into force, Parties gathered at COP-10 to complete the unfinished business from the Marrakesh Accords.</p>
      <p>In addition, they took the opportunity to reassess the building blocks of the process and discuss the framing of a new dialogue on the future of climate change policy.</p>
      <p>This brief analysis attempts to review the UNFCCC process as it begins a 'new chapter,' examining the issues of adaptation and mitigation, the needs of least developed countries (LDCs), and future strategies to address climate change.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_91">
      <h2>THE BRICKS AND MORTAR</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>COP-10 provided an opportunity for delegates to reinforce the two main building blocks of the policy response to climate change: mitigation and adaptation.</p>
      <p>In fact, for the first time, adaptation featured equally to mitigation to the extent that COP-10 was nicknamed 'the Adaptation COP.</p>
      <p>' One delegate, however, noted that this was the third consecutive COP to have received this undeserved nickname, suggesting that a more fitting name for COP-10 would be the 'Adaptation Fiasco.</p>
      <p>' With several developed and developing countries providing testimony on the rise in extreme weather events in their regions, and other recent scientific assessments, such as the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, also drawing attention to climate change impacts, it is becoming increasingly apparent that adaptation is crucial, and countries will need to spend considerable amounts of money to adapt to climate change and recover from extreme weather events.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, others expressed caution, asserting that there is no proof of connections between extreme weather events and climate change.</p>
      <p>Reaching an agreement on the 'adaptation package' was therefore an arduous struggle and the urgency to respond to the impacts of climate change was not evident during the negotiations. While many delegates were agreeable to providing support for small island developing States (SIDS) and the LDCs to adapt to the devastating impacts of climate change, a deadlock resulted due to the demands of some States to address impacts from response measures as the world moves away from fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>During a long Friday night, which extended into Saturday morning, at the end of the COP, there were several moments when delegates doubted that a suitable arrangement could be found that balanced the demands for support for addressing impacts of response measures and support for adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change.</p>
      <p>In the end, an adaptation package was adopted that facilitates, inter alia, the further implementation of measures for adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change and facilitates further activities on modeling and economic diversification regarding the impacts of response measures.</p>
      <p>In a climate in which some saw little chance for agreement, this compromise text is likely a success since no one was particularly happy.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_92">
      <h2>CRACKS IN THE ROOF</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Least developed countries - some of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change - failed for the second consecutive year to secure a decision for full-cost funding of adaptation through the Global Environment Facility (GEF).</p>
      <p>All financial resources for the LDC Fund are channeled through the GEF.</p>
      <p>The problems encountered by the LDC Fund shed light on the core problem of addressing adaptation in the context of the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>Adaptation is an integral part of development, and as such, no project directed at adaptation will fall squarely within the scope of the UNFCCC, but will rather have components that include other aspects of development, such as disaster preparedness, water management, desertification prevention, or biodiversity protection.</p>
      <p>This problem was highlighted with great honesty by a GEF project director who said that when projects fall under many categories, rather than being easily adopted due to their clear synergies and multiple benefits, they become more complex and difficult to approve due to a series of successive revisions needed by different focal areas. To add to this problem, adaptation projects are generally built on, or embedded in, larger national or local development projects and, therefore, the funding by the GEF would only cover a portion of the costs.</p>
      <p>In other words, if a country seeks funding for a project on flood prevention, the GEF would only be able to finance a portion proportional to the additional harm that floods have caused or will cause as a result of climate change, and the rest would have to be co-financed by some other body.</p>
      <p>The plea from LDCs, particularly the SIDS, lies precisely on this paradox, in that even if funds are available in the LDC Fund, their difficulty of finding adequate co-financing, and the costly and cumbersome calculation of the additional costs, renders the financial resources in the LDC Fund, in practice, almost inaccessible. The question to be asked is whether UNFCCC Parties are willing to provide the institutional flexibility needed to address complex, urgent issues that defy traditional approaches to development aid.</p>
      <p>Fundamentally, some say that transfer of financial resources to LDCs is not directly a climate change issue, but is in fact a development issue that maybe should be dealt with elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Others do not seem to be in any hurry and are willing to allow the financial mechanism all the time it needs to find a suitable solution for the operationalization of these funds, including the creation of funding criteria.</p>
      <p>Those most vulnerable have a different view on the urgency of the matter, but it is evident from the COP-10 outcomes that LDCs lack the bargaining power of oil-producing countries and large greenhouse gas emitters.</p>
      <p>If the UNFCCC is to take a strong stance on adaptation for the most vulnerable, LDCs will have to find ways to regain bargaining power within the negotiations and present feasible proposals that fit, however loosely, in the existing financial architecture.</p>
      <p>Developed countries, on the other hand, will need to speed up the analysis of this issue within the GEF and come up with creative solutions that give the GEF the will and flexibility it needs to address this problem.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_93">
      <h2>BLUE PRINT FOR POST-2012</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The recently released report of the UN High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change underlines that countries must take action and commence negotiations for long-term strategy to address climate change.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the Kyoto Protocol requires that Parties initiate consideration of post-2012 commitments by 2005.</p>
      <p>The challenge presented to delegates at COP-10 was how to engage non-Parties to the Protocol in this process and how to ease concerns of many developing countries regarding the imposition of new commitments.</p>
      <p>Delegates struggled behind closed doors over the issue of exactly when and how to discuss future commitments, and opinions varied widely.</p>
      <p>Some wanted a series of informal meetings, or seminars, to openly discuss the future of the climate regime.</p>
      <p>But a few countries felt it was inappropriate to discuss future commitments altogether, and in some discussions countries appeared to try to limit the discussion of climate change issues to the UNFCCC process and not show links to other processes, such as the International Meeting for the 10-year Review of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (BPOA+10), the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) or the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD). With recent national election results in mind, several NGOs, meanwhile, urged delegates to move ahead without non-Parties to the Protocol in the hope of raising the lowest common denominator of consensus and promoting more progressive future commitments.</p>
      <p>After a full night of intensive consultations on the last day of the COP, delegates agreed to have one seminar in 2005 that would not open negotiations leading to new commitments.</p>
      <p>However, it was noted by some that the text did not preclude the initiation of such discussions on the basis of the seminars outcomes. The outcomes of the seminar, according to one expert, will ultimately depend on the skills of the organizers to bring together Parties in an environment that enhances both trust and frank exchange of views and perhaps moves beyond the technical foci of recent COP meetings.</p>
      <p>Some NGOs and scientists have already voiced concern that the process may lack transparency and called for wider civil society access.</p>
      <p>As it stands, only government experts can participate.</p>
      <p>These seminars will also fall amidst a number of other very important processes taking place in 2005, such as the review of progress in the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, initiation of the review by the CSD of the implementation of existing climate change commitments, changes to the COP Bureau and a new Chair of the G-77/China - Jamaica.</p>
      <p>The UK, with its plans to prioritize climate change issues, also embarks on the Presidency of the Group of Eight and the EU.</p>
      <p>All these events will undoubtedly influence the direction and outcomes of the seminar.</p>

      <h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Until the 11th hour, many remained pessimistic about the potential for a deal at COP-10.</p>
      <p>The agreement on seminars was not only a victory for Argentina, but was also an important internal policy marker for some Parties.</p>
      <p>With the agreements on seminars and adaptation, and completion of land use, land-use change and forestry issues, it is safe to say that although many issues remain unresolved, much has been achieved in the past ten years.</p>
      <p>However, what has become crystal clear at COP-10 is that some Parties are not ready to embark on post-2012 negotiations.</p>
      <p>For now, the best that can be hoped for is that Annex I Parties will begin to comply with their emissions reduction commitments and implementation of Protocol mechanisms.</p>
      <p>If Annex I Parties prove that emissions reductions are possible and compatible with development, if carbon markets and/or other tools and incentives are in place so other Parties can see the benefits of participating, and if the costs of climate change impacts start to accrue significantly, the international community may be ready to take further steps in the coordinated global response to climate change.</p>
