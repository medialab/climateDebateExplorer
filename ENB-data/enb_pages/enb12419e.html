      <p>Sudan, for the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern with the lack of progress on issues such as capacity building under the Convention and the Protocol, welcomed agreement on the CGE, and expressed hope that more work would be done at SBI 31 on decision 1/CP.10 (Buenos Aires Programme of Work).</p>

      <p>Grenada, for AOSIS, welcomed the renewal of the CGE s mandate.</p>
      <p>On the financial mechanism, she expressed appreciation to the GEF for support to non-Annex I parties in preparing their national communications, but called for increased funding for subsequent national communications.</p>
      <p>Lesotho, for LDCs, underscored the need for the full implementation of the LDC work programme, including NAPAs. SBI Chair Bratasida closed the session at 10:54 pm.</p>

    <div id="section_31">
      <h2>TECHNOLOGY:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>The AWG-LCA informal plenary convened in the morning to continue considering the draft negotiating text.</p>
      <p>AWG-LCA Chair Zammit Cutajar introduced the revised text on technology and capacity building, which, inter alia, incorporates new textual proposals received from parties, and includes brackets around text that parties proposed deleting during the first reading.</p>
      <p>The second reading of the text on technology and capacity building then commenced.</p>
      <p>Some parties proposed detailed additions to the text, and other parties proposed corrections to ensure that their proposals were properly reflected in the text.</p>
      <p>AWG-LCA Chair Zammit Cutajar recommended that parties email detailed changes to the Secretariat.</p>
      <p>He reminded parties that all textual proposals on finance and mitigation should be submitted for discussions on Thursday and Friday. JAPAN announced a mid-term emission reduction target of 15% from 2005 levels by 2020.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_32">
      <h2>OTHER ISSUES (AWG-KP)</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The contact group convened briefly in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>AWG-KP Vice-Chair Dovland presented a non-paper reflecting the results of the group s work, including the spin-off group on LULUCF, and said he would submit the paper to the AWG-KP Chair. ANNEX I EMISSION REDUCTIONS (AWG-KP): Parties met informally in the morning and afternoon to discuss Annex I parties emission reductions beyond 2012.</p>
      <p>Discussions focused on whether to reflect proposals for Annex I parties individual targets in the Co-Chairs non-paper.</p>
      <p>Some developed countries expressed preference for not including numbers for individual countries, while others said if numbers were to be included, these should only be those proposed by the relevant parties themselves.</p>
      <p>Developing countries stressed the need to reflect the proposals for individual targets in the paper.</p>
      <p>Divergent views remained and discussions will continue.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_33">
      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>On Wednesday, the corridors and meeting rooms were once again busy with delegates attempting to complete work under the SBs.</p>
      <p>Throughout the day, informal consultations were held to finalize outstanding items, such as financial issues and arrangements for intergovernmental meetings.</p>
      <p>Agreement was eventually reached on all issues if not in substantive terms, then at least concerning the process forward.</p>
      <p>Delegates seemed reasonably pleased with many of the outcomes, including the agreement to reconstitute the Consultative Group of Experts on Non-Annex I National Communications.</p>
      <p>However, the evening ended up being long for those following the SBI, as the closing plenary concluded just before 11 pm.</p>
      <p>As the SBs gradually wrapped up, all eyes started shifting towards the AWGs.</p>
      <p>With textual proposals on mitigation and finance due under the AWG-LCA, the Secretariat was anticipating another all-nighter to incorporate the proposals in the draft negotiating text in time for the plenary discussions on Thursday.</p>
      <p>While the AWG-KP contact group on other issues was able to wrap up its work and submit text to the AWG-KP Chair, informal consultations on emission reductions continued throughout the day with little progress reported.</p>
      <p>Some anticipated that the real battle over the AWG-KP conclusions was to come over the next two days.</p>
      <p>I m not sure whether there will be a collective decision by the parties to circulate text on proposed amendments to the Protocol or whether we will end up with several parties submitting their individual amendment proposals, commented one veteran.</p>
      <p>Being a great fan of the Protocol myself, I m worried about its future, he added.</p>
      <p>We ll start Thursday with informal consultations on the AWG-KP conclusions and that s when the rubber will really hit the road, commented another seasoned negotiator on things to come.</p>
