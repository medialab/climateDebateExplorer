      <h2>AWG-KP PLENARY</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>The AWG-KP agreed to discuss various agenda items together.</p>
      <p>Several parties identified the need to start negotiations on Annex I further commitments.</p>
      <p>The EU highlighted 25-40% emission reductions by Annex I countries through a combination of domestic and international measures, while BRAZIL stressed that reductions using the mechanisms be additional to these Annex I reductions.</p>
      <p>NORWAY identified a national reduction target of 30% from 1990 levels by 2020. NEW ZEALAND called for analyzing a range of factors and identifying varying national targets around the aggregate range, but the GAMBIA warned against allowing country-specific circumstances to delay progress.</p>
      <p>CANADA said technical and methodological issues must be understood before deciding commitments.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA and OMAN said sectoral targets should be restricted to Annex I parties, with OMAN stating that he would not accept further obligations beyond the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>The RUSSIAN FEDERATION identified the need to simplify LULUCF rules.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_10">
      <h2>SPILLOVER EFFECTS (AWG-KP):</h2>
      <p>South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, suggested a focus on scope, further analysis and possible solutions.</p>
      <p>JAPAN, CANADA, AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION noted the relevance of these issues to all parties, said both negative and positive implications should be considered, and highlighted co-benefits.</p>
      <p>CHINA said the AWG-KP must focus on Annex I parties and that this discussion should focus on adverse impacts.</p>
      <p>The EU disagreed, preferring a balanced view.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_11">
      <h2>TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (SBI):</h2>
      <p>In informal consultations, delegates discussed the process for the review and assessment of the effectiveness of the implementation of Convention Articles 4.1(c) and 4.5.</p>
      <p>Parties were unable to agree on the timing of the review, with some preferring to postpone it until after COP 15.</p>
      <p>They discussed the frequency of the reviews and composition of the review body, with disagreements over whether it should include EGTT members.</p>
      <p>Parties also began consideration of a draft COP decision on the GEF strategic programme to scale up investment for technology transfer.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>2009 WORK PROGRAMME:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>NORWAY and AUSTRALIA identified the need to consider legal issues and, with NEW ZEALAND, stressed synergies between the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>NORWAY said the work of the two AWGs forms the basis of a comprehensive package in Copenhagen and supported joint meetings.</p>
      <p>NEW ZEALAND proposed that a Committee of the Whole or similar body be created in 2009.</p>
      <p>CHINA opposed any major revision to how the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA conduct their work.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_13">
      <h2>AWG-LCA WORKSHOP ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND RISK REDUCTION STRATEGIES</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Leon Charles (Grenada) chaired the workshop, which sought to enhance understanding of risk management and risk reduction strategies.</p>
      <p>The Secretariat presented the relevant documents ( FCCC/TP/2008/3 , 4 and 9, and FCCC/AWGLCA/2008/INF.2).</p>
      <p>Bekele Geleta, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, stressed risk reduction as the foundation for effective adaptation.</p>
      <p>He highlighted the 2005 Hyogo Framework for Action and said existing institutions should be strengthened.</p>
      <p>Julio Garcia Vargas, UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, discussed national planning for adaptation, sector-specific risk reduction plans, and risk assessments.</p>
      <p>Koko Warner, Munich Climate Insurance Initiative, proposed a focus on prevention and insurance, including climate insurance pools and support for micro and macro-insurance systems.</p>
      <p>She estimated the cost of these initiatives at US$10 billion.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh, for LDCs, supported micro-insurance schemes.</p>
      <p>Micronesia, for AOSIS, proposed a new multi-window mechanism that would include insurance, rehabilitation and compensation, and risk management.</p>
      <p>CHINA said effective disaster response includes capacity building, infrastructure development, monitoring and early warning systems, international and regional cooperation, and insurance instruments.</p>
      <p>The EU said insurance is a useful but context-dependent tool.</p>
      <p>She suggested strengthening the links between the Hyogo Framework for Action and the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>PERU proposed insurance schemes for agricultural protection to cover crops and cattle loss.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND focused on national examples of risk management relating to a flood protection strategy, and the agricultural and forestry sectors.</p>
      <p>The PHILIPPINES noted the need for technical support, climate models, maps and information to implement risk management strategies.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_14">
      <h2>ADAPTATION FUND (COP/MOP)</h2>
      <p>At the contact group, the Philippines, for the G-77/CHINA, highlighted the need to operationalize the Fund as soon as possible and noted three issues to be resolved: cost of GEF services; direct access to funds; and the World Bank s role as a trustee.</p>
      <p>The EU and SWITZERLAND said the Fund should be part of the post-2012 regime and able to attract additional funding.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_15">
      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>As delegates rushed from one group to another on Thursday, some were expressing concern at overlaps between the issues being addressed in different meetings.</p>
      <p>The CDM is being discussed in three groups, and privileges and immunities is also coming up in various places, observed one negotiator.</p>
      <p>Similar issues were also reportedly being raised in the AWG-KP negotiations on spillover effects and on Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 under the SBI/SBSTA.</p>
      <p>I guess some duplication is inevitable given how connected all these issues have become - especially since we have six formal bodies meeting here, said a delegate.</p>
      <p>It s giving me a headache trying to keep track, although I can see the Chairs and Secretariat making a concerted effort to coordinate everything, she added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, some participants from civil society seemed to have given up on trying to follow the contact groups.</p>
      <p>This is too confusing.</p>
      <p>I m going to wait until they come back to plenary, said one bewildered private sector participant.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_2">
      <h2>AWG-KP:</h2>
      <p>The co-facilitators reported on informal consultations on the flexible mechanisms and LULUCF, including efforts to prepare text for the next AWG-KP session.</p>
      <p>On the type of further commitments, South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, supported continuing the current approach but urged defining national targets based on objective criteria rather than political negotiation.</p>
      <p>CHINA highlighted the need for continuity and simplicity and, with TUVALU and the EU, supported retaining 1990 as the base year.-¯JAPAN stated that further commitments should be expressed in absolute emission levels and that using a single base year gives unfair advantage to certain countries.</p>
      <p>AWG-KP Chair Dovland highlighted the need to concentrate on emission reductions and express them clearly.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA proposed that Annex I parties take on at least a 25-40% goal, and INDIA stressed that lifestyle changes could lead to greater reductions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_3">
      <h2>CCS UNDER THE CDM (SBSTA):</h2>
      <p>In a contact group and informal consultations, delegates considered draft text setting out various options, including an EU proposal for a pilot phase.</p>
      <p>Some parties supported CCS under the CDM, while others said it should not be included in the current commitment period, but might be considered at a later stage.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_4">
      <h2>CDM (COP/MOP):</h2>
      <p>Co-Chair Børsting highlighted the contact group s focus on the CDM s operational aspects, including geographic distribution.</p>
      <p>He explained that the structure of the draft text is similar to that of previous COP/MOP decisions.</p>
      <p>He noted, inter alia , requests to the CDM Executive Board to: emphasize its executive and supervisory role; increase transparency; complete as a highest priority revision of the DOE accreditation process; and streamline procedures for countries with fewer than five projects.</p>
      <p>BRAZIL outlined his proposal to expand eligibility criteria for afforestation and reforestation activities.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_5">
      <h2>COMPLIANCE (COP/MOP):</h2>
      <p>Compliance Committee Co-Chair Oberthür explained proposed amendments to the Committee s rules of procedure.</p>
      <p>These amendments would introduce transparent rules for the calculation of time periods, clarify parties right to be represented, and elaborate rules concerning the submission and assessment of compliance action plans.</p>
      <p>CANADA and JAPAN raised concerns about introducing new criteria concerning compliance action plans.</p>
      <p>On the Committee s independent experts, NEW ZEALAND and the EU noted that privileges and immunities are also considered under the SBI.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Lefevere said the contact group could, for instance, recommend the consideration of the issue under the SBI.</p>
      <p>The Co-Chairs will prepare a draft text and consult informally.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_6">
      <h2>FINANCIAL MECHANISM (SBI):</h2>
      <p>During informal consultations, delegates continued to discuss the draft decision on the fourth review of the financial mechanism.</p>
      <p>Disagreement persisted on the title for the first section, which concerns the assessment of funding to assist developing countries in fulfilling their commitments under the Convention.</p>
      <p>No text was agreed.</p>
      <p>Informal consultations will continue.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_7">
      <h2>MITIGATION AND MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION (AWG-LCA):</h2>
      <p>During the contact group, Brazil, for the G-77/CHINA, rejected proposals for differentiation among non-Annex I parties.</p>
      <p>SINGAPORE and the BAHAMAS said diverse national circumstances should be taken into account.</p>
      <p>JAPAN suggested broadening Annex I on the basis of multiple criteria and differentiating among developing countries.</p>
      <p>Barbados, for AOSIS, said developed countries should take the lead and developing countries should pursue a clean development pathway.</p>
      <p>The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP noted that all parties to the Convention have to undertake actions and drew attention to South Korea s proposal to establish a registry of nationally appropriate mitigation actions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_8">
      <h2>PROTOCOL ARTICLES 2.3 AND 3.14 (SBI/SBSTA):</h2>
      <p>Delegates responded to draft text on Articles 2.3 and 3.14.</p>
      <p>The EU noted the need to take into account ongoing, relevant discussions under other SBI agenda items, the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia, for the G-77/CHINA, observed that Annex I communications have provided little information on how policies and measures have impacted on developing countries.</p>
      <p>The EU explained that it was difficult to ascertain potential impacts and requested developing countries to provide information on impacts experienced.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA called for a focus on actual rather than potential impacts.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12389e_9">
      <h2>REDD (SBSTA):</h2>
      <p>Parties met informally in the morning to identify areas of agreement, and in the evening to consider draft text seeking to clarify, inter alia ,possible elements of agreed progress.</p>
      <p>Some parties sought a COP decision to demonstrate progress, while others wished to focus on further refining methodological advice.</p>
      <p>Discussions also addressed interaction with the AWG-LCA, with some parties suggesting that progress is needed on the policy side to specify outstanding methodological work.</p>
      <p>Parties also considered future expert consultations and a possible request for submissions on capacity building needs.</p>
