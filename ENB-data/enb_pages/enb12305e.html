      <h2>ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL MATTERS:</h2>

      <p>Delegates adopted SBI conclusions prepared by SBI Chair Becker on budget performance for the biennium 2006-2007 (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.3) and on Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.5).</p>

    <div id="section_2">
      <h2>UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 &amp; 4.9</h2>
      <small>SBI</small>
      <p>On matters relating to the least developed countries (LDCs), Samuel Adejuwon (Nigeria), who co-facilitated the informal consultations, reported agreement on the LDC Expert Group's work programme, and delegates adopted the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.2). CAPACITY BUILDING (CONVENTION): Contact group Co-Chair Crispin D'Auvergne (St. Lucia) summarized discussions.</p>
      <p>CHINA noted that the proposal by some parties to integrate monitoring with the comprehensive review would mean that the results of regular monitoring would only be seen every five years.</p>
      <p>Parties then adopted the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.15). FINANCIAL MECHANISM (CONVENTION): On the Special Climate Change Fund, contact group chair Bubu Jallow (Gambia) reported progress on understanding what a staged approach to support various economic development issues could mean, noting that the SB 22 text would be the basis of deliberations at SB 25.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA said the phased approach is really only one stage.</p>
      <p>Delegates then adopted the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.6).</p>
      <p>On the third review of the financial mechanism, contact group Co-Chair Marcia Levaggi (Argentina) noted that the annex to the draft SBI conclusions is a compilation of views expressed and could be used as the basis for negotiations at SBI 25, but that it is still open for further input.</p>
      <p>Parties then adopted the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.4).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_3">
      <h2>ARRANGEMENTS OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS:</h2>
      <small>SBI</small>
      <p>Parties adopted conclusions addressing arrangements for COP 12, COP/MOP 2 and future sessional periods, and review of arrangements for COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.9).</p>
      <p>Contact group Co-Chair Sandea de Wet (South Africa) noted that the SBI, SBSTA, AWG and UNFCCC Dialogue will all take place in the next sessional period, and that meetings will close by 6:00 pm unless exceptional circumstances arise.</p>
      <p>Richard Kinley, Officer-in-Charge, UNFCCC Secretariat, said these conclusions on meeting arrangements were quite revolutionary for this process.</p>
      <p>He said the Secretariat would discontinue the current practice of scheduling evening meetings, and that the decision on what constitutes exceptional circumstances would be left to elected officers.</p>
      <p>He noted the significant implications of restricting the negotiating time available at meetings, given that there are about 36 substantive items or sub-items on the various agendas to be addressed in Nairobi.</p>
      <p>Describing the changes as shock therapy, he expressed his deep anxiety that such an approach could lead to process paralysis unless parties prioritize issues. CAPACITY BUILDING (PROTOCOL): Contact group Co-Chair Anders Turesson (Sweden) reported that there had been no resolution of this issue, and parties adopted conclusions that forward the matter to SBI 25 (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.16).</p>

      <p>Following informal consultations, delegates agreed on the text contained in the draft conclusions proposed by the SBI Chair, which states that the SBI invited relevant international institutions, including, among others, those contained in the annex without prejudice to any institution, and adopted the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2006/L.18).</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA, the EU, NORWAY and SWITZERLAND then made statements on the aforementioned text.</p>

AD HOC WORKING GROUP The AWG plenary convened shortly before midnight.</p>
      <p>This followed informal consultations that had extended throughout Thursday in a small group setting, with several delegates and A WG Chair Michael Zammit Cutajar working on a text on planning of future work distributed in the morning (FCCC/KP/AWG/2006/L.2).</p>
      <p>Opening the late night plenary, Chair Zammit Cutajar outlined the revised text resulting from the informal negotiations, including paragraphs that he said: describe the focus of AWG; add momentum to the process; describe work that needs to be done for commitments; address the review of implementation of the first commitment period; describe the workshop to be held in Nairobi; set out the organization of the workshop; and explain that the workshop will meet during 2007 regular sessions and that AWG work plan will be further elaborated in the next session.</p>
      <p>The text also includes a Chair indicative non-exhaustive list of topics that may be relevant to the further work of the group.</p>
      <p>He indicated that the text would be part of the report of the session. SWITZERLAND proposed adding text to ensure that that AWG future work is transparent and open to all parties.</p>

      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>A sense of relief was apparent among many participants shortly after midnight on Thursday night as the AWG finally completed its work.</p>
      <p>After lengthy informal consultations, AWG Chair Michael Zammit Cutajar successfully steered the first session to a close after a compromise was achieved that included new language on working expeditiously towards agreement on further Annex I commitments.</p>
      <p>Many delegates seemed satisfied at the result, and those not involved in the final small group negotiations that finalized the deal will likely be poring over the document Friday morning.</p>
      <p>According to the late night talk in the corridors, that small group did not include the major non-parties to the Protocol, but did include other big emitters from both Annex I and non-Annex I.</p>
