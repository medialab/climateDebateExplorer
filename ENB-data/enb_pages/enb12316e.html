    <h1>Earth Negotiations Bulletin: COP/MOP2</h1>
    <p><b>UN Climate Change Conference – Nairobi 2006</b></p>

      <h2>UNFCCC DIALOGUE</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>Sandea De Wet (South Africa) opened the second workshop under the Dialogue, recalling the COP decision to keep the dialogue as informal as possible and calling for expanding the creative space.</p>

      <h2>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ON ECONOMICS AND INVESTMENTS RELATING TO CLIMATE CHANGE:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Nicholas Stern presented his review on the economics of climate change, which he identified as the biggest market failure the world has seen.</p>
      <p>He stressed urgency of action in the next 10-20 years, and said the economic costs of strong and early action to stabilize atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases would amount to only 1% of global GDP, noting that mitigation is a growth story.</p>
      <p>He emphasized the importance of long-term goals and short-term flexibility, but also persuasion and equity, and underscored interlinking carbon markets, developing technologies and clear policies.</p>
      <p>Stern also highlighted country-driven efforts to address deforestation and the intimate relationship between adaptation and development, and called for increasing ODA and global energy R&amp;D.</p>
      <p>He concluded by warning of the serious economic impacts of delaying action, and recalled that the costs of curbing emissions are consistent with growth but that decisive and strong action is urgently needed.</p>
      <p>Responding to questions, Stern underscored, inter alia : that there is no unique path for any single stabilization goal; the importance of local conditions for adaptation; that SIDS are not addressed adequately in aggregate climate models; the need to involve finance ministries; the importance of investment flows created by carbon markets to build the necessary trust to bring international agreement forward; exaggeration of mitigation costs and their impact on competitiveness; international sectoral agreements for energy-intensive industries; and that developing countries suffer more due to their geographic position, have less diversified economies, and less resources to cope.</p>
      <p>Katherine Sierra, World Bank, reported on the World Bank Investment Framework on Clean Energy and Development, addressing the need for increased concessional funding for electrification in sub-Saharan Africa and increased ODA support for energy access; the role of emissions trading in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and financing needs; and investment options.</p>
      <p>On adaptation, she said ODA and private investment are exposed to climate risks and at least $1 billion will be needed to climate proof the development portfolio.</p>

      <h2>ADVANCING DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Howard Bamsey (Australia) opened the afternoon session.</p>
      <p>Gao Guangsheng, China National Coordination Group for Climate Change, explained that under China 11th Five-Year Plan, energy intensity was expected to drop by around 20%.</p>
      <p>He emphasized China efforts on energy and forestry, and called for international financial and technical cooperation.</p>
      <p>Leon Charles, Climate Project Coordinator, Grenada, recalled unprecedented devastation and loss of life from Hurricane Ivan, noting the gap between pledges of relief and actual contributions, which he compared to funding under UNFCCC .</p>
      <p>He cited Stern observation about the potentially catastrophic impact of a 2 C temperature rise on SIDS, and called for the impact on SIDS to become the benchmark for the determination of future climate change targets.</p>
      <p>He also called for a support fund to help SIDS recover from extreme events. JAMAICA noted the absence of consideration of SIDS in global climate modeling.</p>
      <p>Marina Silva, Minister of Environment, Brazil, noted that the perception that reducing deforestation is easier than changing the energy matrix in developed countries is unfair.</p>
      <p>Jo o Paulo Ribeiro Capobianco, Environment Ministry of Brazil, explained the Brazilian proposal to provide positive incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation in developing countries, noting that it is a voluntary arrangement that implies no future obligations and does not count towards Annex I emission reductions targets.</p>
      <p>Youba Sokona, Sahara and Sahel Observatory, called for a development first approach to climate change.</p>
      <p>Noting that scaling up remains a problem and the need for cooperation at all levels, he stressed wider community engagement.</p>
      <p>Responding to comments, Sokona said there is no fundamental contradiction in approaching climate change within the development strategies of individual states.</p>
      <p>BUSINESS stressed the role of industry in disseminating and advancing technology.</p>
      <p>Olav Kj rven, UNDP, highlighted: the relationship between MDGs and climate risk, noting that up to 40% of donor-funded development activities may be at risk from climate change; and prospects to combine adaptation and mitigation opportunities through, for example, community-level forestry and land rehabilitation. GERMANY described how policies to support renewable energy can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases and to sustainable development, including job creation.</p>

      <h2>INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS CDM:</h2>
      <small>working group — groups</small>
      <p>Discussions on the Co-Chairs draft COP/MOP decision remained deadlocked on a number of issues, including guidelines for the eligibility of afforestation/reforestation (A/R) projects, with differences between some developed and developing countries on the interpretation of COP 9 decisions.</p>
      <p>Parties were invited to consider two optional approaches to a request for submissions on the limit established for small-scale A/R CDM project activities under Decision 6/CMP.1.</p>
      <p>One option would request parties to submit views on the adequacy of the limit, and another would invite parties and accredited observers to submit views on the possibility of changing the limit.</p>
      <p>Parties also discussed a possible call for submissions on carbon capture and storage, and on the need for further research.</p>
      <p>On regional distribution, parties considered alternative approaches to encouraging Annex I parties to support non-Annex I parties, especially LDCs.</p>

      <h2>IN THE BREEZEWAYS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>While speeches by Kofi Annan and Nicholas Stern had delegates crowding plenary rooms and congregating around television monitors at Gigiri in the morning, the UNFCCC Dialogue afternoon session did not meet all expectations.</p>
      <p>More like a monologue, suggested one delegate, who noted too little time for interactive discussions.</p>
      <p>However, optimists observed that this was the first time some new proposals were formally presented.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the question over which entity might host the Adaptation Fund was also being discussed.</p>
      <p>While some predict that a decision is unlikely until 2007, insiders report that one prominent candidate to host the Fund has pushed the matter back onto the Nairobi agenda, in the corridors at least, with some forceful lobbying.</p>
