      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CONVENTION</h2>
      <small>HISTORY</small>
      <p>Increasing scientific evidence about the possibility of global climate change in the 1980s led to a growing consensus that human activities have been contributing to substantial increases in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p>Concerned that anthropogenic increases of emissions enhance the natural greenhouse effect and would result, on average, in an additional warming of the Earth's surface, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988.</p>
      <p>The Panel focused on: assessing scientific information related to the various aspects of climate change; evaluating the environmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change; and formulating response strategies.</p>
      <p>In 1990, the finalization and adoption of the IPCC report and the Second World Climate Conference focused further attention on climate change.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO</h2>
      <p>On behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), Amb.</p>
      <p>Annette des Iles noted the particular vulnerability of small island States to the consequences of global climate change, as evidenced by the devastation caused by the recent onslaught of storms in the Eastern Caribbean and the Pacific, and the pressing need to take immediate action to deter global warming.</p>
      <p>The Draft Protocol submitted to the Convention by AOSIS in September 1994, which recommended that developed countries reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2005, was not accepted as hoped at COP-1.</p>
      <p>However, AOSIS was pleased with the Berlin Mandate, which notes that current commitments are insufficient to fulfill the mandate of the Convention.</p>
      <p>AOSIS will continue to work with the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate to ensure the adoption of a legal instrument to achieve the additional and necessary commitments called for in the Mandate.</p>
      <p>While the Berlin Mandate is crucial in addressing further commitments beyond the year 2000, it is critical that the current commitments of the Convention be fulfilled, and that the industrialized countries lead the way, as was expressly called for in the Convention.</p>
      <p>The leadership role assigned to the industrialized countries also entails the provision of support and technology to developing countries to better enable them to fulfill their commitments.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_11">
      <h2>SAMOA</h2>
      <p>Andrea Williams-Stewart reported that the annual meeting of the South Pacific Forum took place in Papua New Guinea two months ago, where the concerns of Pacific nations regarding climate change were reaffirmed.</p>
      <p>She outlined two matters of fundamental importance to the progress of the AGBM.</p>
      <p>The first is the urgency of concluding the work of the AGBM by 1997, so that its results can be considered at COP- 3.</p>
      <p>The second matter concerns the results of the IPCC's Second Assessment Report, which clearly indicate the reality of climate change and the necessity and economic feasibility of taking urgent action.</p>
      <p>The fact that certain Parties are requesting further analysis has raised concerns that the work of the IPCC and others will be duplicated, and the completion of the Berlin Mandate process will be delayed.</p>
      <p>There have, however, been some promising initiatives made in the AGBM process, such as the European Union's proposal for an outline protocol framework, which was tabled at the last session of the AGBM.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_12">
      <h2>INDIA</h2>
      <p>Sharad Pawar said that the Climate Change Convention embodies not only the control of greenhouse gas emissions to protect the global climate, but also the goals of poverty eradication, achievement of sustained economic growth in developing countries, and averting the negative impact of climate change on food production and on the livelihood and habitat of the poor.</p>
      <p>The ability to address all of these issues depends on the obligations of the Annex I countries to take the first steps - to fulfill their commitments under the Convention, as well as to provide new and additional resources and technologies to developing countries.</p>
      <p>Although it has been acknowledged that the commitments under the current Convention are inadequate, there has been reluctance to proceed and define further reductions.</p>
      <p>In fact, after Berlin, many are even challenging existing commitments.</p>
      <p>The burden of reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be shared equitably by developed and developing countries, and this equity entails an understanding of historical and cumulative emissions.</p>
      <p>Procrastination on the part of the developed countries will only impair the ability of developing countries to achieve their development aspirations and worsen the situation for all inhabitants of the planet.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_13">
      <h2>PAPUA NEW GUINEA</h2>
      <p>Adam Vai Delaney said the threats of global warming, sea-level rise, and the immense potential to change the world's atmosphere, are central to understanding the urgency of the issues related to the Convention.</p>
      <p>The Berlin Mandate is not adequate.</p>
      <p>The decision concerning concrete emissions reduction targets for the next century needs strengthening.</p>
      <p>Necessary support should urgently be given to the establishment of the permanent Secretariat in Bonn.</p>
      <p>For the Convention to succeed, Annex I countries will have to adopt a more constructive partnership and assume responsibility for the huge quantities of greenhouse gases they have emitted into the atmosphere over the last century.</p>
      <p>The transfer of clean, affordable technologies is an obligation under the Convention and will contribute towards improving the efficiency of global energy consumption.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_14">
      <h2>VENEZUELA</h2>
      <p>Jacnedine Dordelly said her country has adopted measures to prevent the emission of greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p>She reaffirmed Venezuela's determination to do its share in the international arena to address climate change issues.</p>
      <p>Environmental protection must be compatible with economic growth and sustainable development.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_15">
      <h2>CHINA</h2>
      <p>Yang Yanyi recalled the obligation of developed countries to take the lead in combating climate change, and to provide new and additional financial resources and transfer environmentally sound technologies to assist the developing countries in fulfilling their commitments.</p>
      <p>These obligations have not been fulfilled, and the threat of global climate change remains.</p>
      <p>The decisions taken at Berlin, such as the establishment of the SBI and the SBSTA, the agreement on the GEF as the interim financial mechanism, and the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly, are encouraging steps toward the realization of the goals of the Convention.</p>
      <p>Most important, however, was the agreement to intensify the commitments of the developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, which by no means should increase the obligations of the developing countries.</p>
      <p>China is committed to doing its part to address climate change based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_16">
      <h2>MARSHALL ISLANDS</h2>
      <p>Espen RÃ¸nneberg stated that the findings of the IPCC, which testify to the reality of climate change, are indeed being confirmed by the increasing frequency and severity of storms.</p>
      <p>These storms are ever more damaging to the economies of the affected countries, particularly the most vulnerable small island States.</p>
      <p>It is imperative that the actions mandated in the Convention be undertaken immediately to avert climatic disaster on a global scale.</p>
      <p>Support and funding for adaptation measures should be a priority, as should work on mitigation efforts.</p>
      <p>Urgent attention should also be focused on the completion of the work of the Berlin Mandate.</p>
      <p>Efforts to improve the prospects for future global climatic stability must not be sacrificed for short-term economic interests.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_17">
      <h2>FIJI</h2>
      <p>Graham E. Leung stated that the momentum must be maintained to ensure that the work of the AGBM is completed on time.</p>
      <p>The widest possible participation in these negotiations should be supported, given the overriding importance of strengthening the commitments of the Convention.</p>
      <p>He expressed concern that at the conclusion of the first session of COP-1, questions regarding rules of procedure and the composition of the Bureau remained unresolved.</p>
      <p>It is crucial that a representative of the small island developing States be included on the Bureau of the COP, considering their special stake in this issue.</p>
      <p>Matters relating to rules of procedure are trivial in light of the pressing need to strengthen commitments, and these matters must therefore be resolved once and for all so that the substantive and important work can be accomplished.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_18">
      <h2>REPUBLIC OF KOREA</h2>
      <p>Ha-Yong Moon urged the Parties to establish goals and timetables for greenhouse gas emission reductions as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>He stressed the importance of acknowledging the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.</p>
      <p>The most effective way to ward off global warming is to employ cleaner and more efficient technologies, and these technologies must be made available to developing countries.</p>
      <p>In this regard, the formation of the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI) by the OECD is a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p>Another crucial element in combating global warming is scientific and technological capacity-building in developing countries.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_19">
      <h2>EGYPT</h2>
      <p>Abdel-Gaffar Eldeeb said a clear link between climate change and economic development must be established.</p>
      <p>Parties to the Climate Change Convention must look at new developments, since recent reports have emphasized that the dangers of climate change have become a reality.</p>
      <p>An additional protocol should be drafted to address these new findings.</p>
      <p>Such a protocol should not pose additional burdens on developing countries.</p>
      <p>Increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from unsustainable patterns of production and consumption in developed countries must be addressed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_2">
      <h2>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INC/FCCC</h2>
      <p>On 11 December 1990, the 45th session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC/FCCC).</p>
      <p>Supported by UNEP and WMO, the mandate of the INC/FCCC was to prepare an effective framework convention on climate change.</p>
      <p>The INC held five sessions between February 1991 and May 1992.</p>
      <p>During these meetings, participants from over 150 States discussed the contentious issues of binding commitments, targets and timetables for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, financial mechanisms, technology transfer, and 'common but differentiated' responsibilities of developed and developing countries.</p>
      <p>The INC sought to achieve a consensus that could be supported by a broad majority, rather than drafting a treaty that dealt with specific policies that might limit participation.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_20">
      <h2>SRI LANKA</h2>
      <p>Prasad Kariyawasam said that Sri Lanka is in the process of implementing its commitments under the Climate Change Convention.</p>
      <p>An Inter-Ministerial Coordinating Committee has been established to coordinate and monitor activities applicable under the Convention.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka became a signatory to the Manila Declaration at the Asia Pacific Leaders Conference on Climate Change.</p>
      <p>The country's first report on greenhouse gas emissions has been prepared as part of a regional study undertaken by the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).</p>
      <p>The possibility of establishing a separate financial mechanism for the Convention should not be prematurely dismissed, in light of the insufficiency of funds available from the GEF for national projects pertinent to the Convention.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_21">
      <h2>IRAN</h2>
      <p>Mohammad Jabbary stated that developing countries should not be expected to implement policies or accept requirements that jeopardize their efforts toward social and economic development and the eradication of poverty.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Annex I Parties, as the primary emitters of greenhouse gases, have not made adequate attempts to fulfill their commitments under the Convention.</p>
      <p>The necessary transfers of technology and financial resources to developing countries, as stipulated in the Convention, are also sorely lacking.</p>
      <p>The objectives of the Convention will be difficult to achieve in the presence of these inconsistencies.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_22">
      <h2>11TH SESSION OF THE IPCC</h2>
      <small>IPCC</small>
      <p>The eleventh session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) met in Rome from 11-15 December 1995.</p>
      <p>Some 500 experts from 120 countries attended the meeting to adopt the Second Assessment Report, which was drawn up with the help of 2,000 scientists worldwide. Like its First Assessment Report, which was published in 1990, the IPCC's Second Assessment Report was prepared by three working groups.</p>
      <p>Working Group I analyzed the functioning of the climate system and potential changes to it resulting from human activities.</p>
      <p>Working Group II assessed potential impacts of climate change, adaptation strategies, and measures that could be adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>Working Group III focused on evaluating the economic implications of climate change. The draft Second Assessment Report, which highlights a 'discernible human influence' on climate, goes beyond the 1990 report when human influence on climate was something that could not really be concluded at all.</p>
      <p>WMO Secretary- General Godwin Obasi told the delegates at the opening ceremony this conclusion was 'a warning to humanity that we have gone beyond the point where the sustainable use of the atmosphere as a highly mobile dump for man's waste is possible without serious consequences'. Based on the findings of the three working groups, the draft report says that the earth's temperature could rise by between one and 3.5 degrees Celsius by the year 2010 - an average rate of warming probably higher than any in the last 10,000 years.</p>
      <p>It says it would expect temperatures to continue rising after that, even if emissions of the greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane that trap heat in the atmosphere were stabilized at that time. While not all scientists agree on the causes, or even the phenomenon of global warming, most believe the build-up of such gases, to a large part caused by burning fossil fuels, could have drastic consequences.</p>
      <p>The draft IPCC report came under fire from major oil producing countries, who want no action on cutting emissions until there is scientific certainty.</p>
      <p>These countries spent much of the week attempting to block adoption of the report. The IPCC report will be published in the following three volumes in early 1996: Volume 1: The Science of Climate Change; Volume 2: Scientific-Technical Analyses of Impacts, Adaptations, and Mitigation of Climate Change; and Volume 3: Economics and Social Dimensions.</p>

      <h2>GENERAL ASSEMBLY HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
      <small>COP</small>
      <p>The Second Committee of the UN General Assembly considered Agenda Item 96(d), 'Protection of Global Climate for Present and Future Generations,' on 15-16 November 1995.</p>
      <p>The Executive Secretary of the Convention, Michael Zammit- Cutajar, presented the final report of the Chair of the INC/FCCC (A/50/536) and the report of the Secretary-General (A/50/716).</p>
      <p>The former lays out the preparatory work that has been undertaken, describes the outcome of COP-1, and assesses the current state of play in the Convention.</p>
      <p>The report of the Secretary-General requests that the General Assembly endorse the principle of an institutional linkage between the Convention Secretariat and the United Nations.</p>
      <p>It also appeals to the General Assembly to respond to the COP's request to finance the conference-servicing costs of the Convention bodies from the United Nations programme budget.</p>
      <p>Such financing would specifically apply to six weeks of meetings per year until the end of 1999.</p>
      <p>The report also relates the Secretariat's plans both for the transfer of fund balances remaining at the end of the year and for transitional arrangements of administrative support to the Convention Secretariat for the coming biennium.</p>
      <p>Cutajar appealed to Parties to make their contributions to the 1996 Convention budget prior to 1 January 1996, and to the General Assembly for a positive response to the request for financing of conference services from the UN programme budget. On behalf of the President of the first session of the Conference of the Parties, Angela Merkel, Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety of Germany, Takao Shibata (Japan) reported on the accomplishments of COP-1.</p>
      <p>Twenty-one decisions were adopted by consensus.</p>
      <p>The Berlin Mandate was established and provides a process for further commitments on the part of industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond the year 2000.</p>
      <p>As the majority of delegates agreed that current commitments are inadequate to achieve the objectives of the Convention, the Berlin Mandate will address the need to quantify limitation and reduction objectives within specific time-frames.</p>
      <p>COP-1 also took decisions relating to the format and review of national communications of Annex I Parties.</p>
      <p>Such communications will be subject to an in-depth review by experts nominated by both Annex I and non-Annex I Parties.</p>
      <p>This review process should be completed by COP-2.</p>
      <p>Another achievement of COP-1 was the establishment of a pilot phase for activities implemented jointly.</p>
      <p>Notable among the decisions regarding the institutional arrangements for the Convention Secretariat is the institutional linkage of the Secretariat with the UN.</p>
      <p>This linkage will facilitate the work of the Secretariat by providing it with an established framework of rules and regulations, as well as appropriate administrative support services.</p>
      <p>Along these lines, the COP requested that the General Assembly finance the conference-servicing costs of the sessions of the COP and its subsidiary bodies from the UN programme budget.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_24">
      <h2>PHILIPPINES</h2>
      <p>On behalf of the G-77 and China, Cecilia Baltazar Rebong reaffirmed the Group's commitment to the objectives of the Convention, and to the fulfillment of their obligations.</p>
      <p>The G-77 urges its developed country partners to fulfill their obligations under the Convention, particularly those pertaining to the provision of new and additional financial resources and the transfer of technology on preferential and concessional terms.</p>
      <p>It is essential that immediate action be taken to address the climate change issue, and this action must be predicated on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.</p>
      <p>The ratification of the Convention by 144 States and one regional economic integration organization is an encouraging indication that the global community agrees on the central importance of global climate protection.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_25">
      <h2>GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION</h2>
      <small>COP</small>
      <p>On 5 December 1995, the Second Committee adopted a draft resolution (A/C.2/50/L.33), which had been submitted by Vice Chair Conor Murphy (Ireland) after informal consultations.</p>
      <p>The resolution endorses the institutional linkage between the Secretariat of the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the United Nations.</p>
      <p>The Secretary-General is requested to review the functioning of this institutional linkage no later than 31 December 1999.</p>
      <p>The resolution notes that the Conference of the Parties to the Convention decided to accept the offer of the Government of Germany to host the Convention Secretariat and expresses its appreciation for the support of the future host Government for the relocation and effective functioning of the Secretariat. The resolution also urges Parties to the Convention to pay promptly their 1996 and 1997 contributions to the trust fund for the core budget of the Convention to ensure continuity in the cash flow required to finance the ongoing work of the COP, its subsidiary bodies and the Convention Secretariat.</p>
      <p>The resolution also decides that conference servicing will be provided for twelve weeks of meetings in 1996-1997.</p>
      <p>The Secretary-General is requested to include in the Calendar of Conferences and meetings for the biennium 1998-1999 sessions of the COP and its subsidiary bodies that the Conference may need to convene in that period. The statement on the financial implications of this resolution is contained in document A/C.2/50/L.49. The resolution is expected to be formally adopted by the General Assembly Plenary before Christmas.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_3">
      <h2>ADOPTION AND ENTRY INTO FORCE</h2>
      <p>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted on 9 May 1992, and was opened for signature at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, where it received 155 signatures.</p>
      <p>The Convention entered into force on 21 March 1994, 90 days after receipt of the 50th ratification. After the adoption of the Convention, the INC met five more times to consider the following items: matters relating to commitments; arrangements for the financial mechanism and for technical and financial support to developing countries; procedural and legal issues; and institutional matters.</p>
      <p>During these INC sessions, scientific work was undertaken to improve the methodologies for measuring emissions from various sources, but the larger scientific problem was determining the best methodology to estimate the removal of carbon dioxide by 'sinks,' namely oceans and forests.</p>
      <p>The other major task before negotiators was the difficult issue of financial support for implementation, particularly for developing country Parties who will require 'new and additional financial resources' to obtain data and implement energy-efficient technologies and other necessary measures. The eleventh and final session of the INC met from 6-17 February 1995, at UN Headquarters in New York.</p>
      <p>During the two-week session, delegates addressed a wide range of issues including arrangements for the first session of the COP, location of the Permanent Secretariat, rules of procedure for the COP, matters relating to commitments, arrangements for the financial mechanism, and provision of technical and financial support to developing country Parties. While delegates did agree to maintain the Global Environment Facility (GEF) as the interim entity to operate the financial mechanism and to finance mitigation activities, little concrete progress was made on other important issues before the Committee.</p>
      <p>Delegates were unable to take action on the adequacy of commitments or to begin negotiations on the draft protocol submitted by AOSIS or the proposals for further elements of a protocol submitted by Germany.</p>
      <p>There was no progress on joint implementation.</p>
      <p>Delegates had little time to address technical and financial support to developing countries.</p>
      <p>The location of the Permanent Secretariat remained pending, although the four countries offering to host the Secretariat (Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Uruguay) were asked to negotiate among themselves to present a single nomination to the COP in Berlin.</p>
      <p>Finally, delegates were unable to reach agreement on the rules of procedure due to lack of agreement on voting procedures and the allocation of seats on the COP Bureau.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_4">
      <h2>CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES</h2>
      <small>plenary</small>
      <p>The first meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-1) took place in Berlin from 28 March - 7 April 1995.</p>
      <p>In this historic city that was once the symbol of the Cold War's division between East and West, delegates from 117 Parties and 53 observer States found that although the Berlin Wall has fallen, the walls that divide the Parties to the Convention still stand.</p>
      <p>After hours of negotiations and consultations, delegates with vastly different priorities and concerns came to agreement on what many believed to be the central issue before COP-1 - adequacy of commitments.</p>
      <p>The result was a mandate to launch a process toward appropriate action for the period beyond the year 2000, including the strengthening of the commitments of developed countries. Delegates also reached agreement on a number of other important decisions, including the establishment of a pilot phase for implementation of joint projects, agreement that the Permanent Secretariat will be located in Bonn, Germany, and decisions on the budget for the Secretariat, financial procedures and the establishment of the subsidiary bodies.</p>
      <p>Delegates, however, did not reach consensus on the rules of procedure.</p>
      <p>This critical issue, including a decision on the voting rules and the composition of the Bureau, was deferred until COP-2.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_1225000e_5">
      <h2>SUBSIDIARY BODY ON SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ADVICE (SBSTA)</h2>
      <p>The SBSTA was established by COP-1 to be the link between scientific, technical and technological assessments, information provided by competent international bodies, and the policy-oriented needs of the COP. The first meeting of the SBSTA was held in Geneva from 28-30 August 1995.</p>
      <p>Delegates confronted a daunting array of technically and politically complex issues, including: scientific assessments, national communications from Annex I Parties, methodologies, first communications from non-Annex I Parties, activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase, transfer of technology, allocation and control of international bunker fuels, possible contributions to the 'Berlin Mandate' process, cooperation with competent international bodies, including the IPCC, proposals on longer term activities, and a workshop on NGO inputs.</p>
      <p>The SBSTA was also supposed to establish intergovernmental technical advisory panels on technologies (TAP-T) and methodologies (TAP-M).</p>
      <p>However, the SBSTA did not have time to consider all of these issues.</p>
      <p>Among the more contentious issues were: definition of the SBSTA's relationship with the IPCC, the terms of reference and composition of the TAPs and the elaboration of guidelines for national communications from non-Annex I Parties.</p>
      <p>By the end of the meeting, delegates successfully identified areas for cooperation with the IPCC, agreed on a division of labor with the SBI on technology transfer issues, and requested the Secretariat to organize a workshop on non-governmental inputs, among other things.</p>
      <p>However, no progress was made on the formation of the TAPs and delegates had no choice to resume this discussion at the second session.</p>

      <h2>SUBSIDIARY BODY ON IMPLEMENTATION (SBI)</h2>
      <small>SBI</small>
      <p>The first meeting of the SBI took place from 31 August - 1 September 1995 in Geneva.</p>
      <p>The SBI addressed: communications from Annex I Parties; a progress report on in-depth review; institutional and budgetary matters; matters relating to the financial mechanism; and the elaboration and scheduling of the programme of work for 1996-1997.</p>
      <p>Delegates rapidly adopted the SBI's work programme and recommended that the COP adopt the draft Memorandum of Understanding with the GEF as the financial mechanism, and proposed a draft decision on this item to be adopted by the COP at its second session.</p>

      <h2>FIRST SESSION OF THE AD HOC GROUP ON THE BERLIN MANDATE</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>COP-1 established an open-ended Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM) through decision FCCC/CP/1995/7/Add.1/ Decision 1/CP.1.</p>
      <p>In this decision, known as the 'Berlin Mandate' (BM), the COP agreed to begin a process to strengthen the commitments on the part of industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond the year 2000 through the adoption of a protocol or other legal instrument. At its first session, which was held in Geneva from 21-25 August 1995, the AGBM considered several issues, including an analysis and assessment to identify possible policies and measures for Annex I Parties and requests for inputs to subsequent sessions.</p>
      <p>Delegates debated the nature, content and duration of the analysis and assessment and its relationship to other aspects of the process.</p>
      <p>Several developed and developing countries stressed that analysis and assessment should be conducted in parallel and not prior to the negotiations, but a few developing countries held that more time was needed, particularly to evaluate economic costs.</p>
      <p>Regarding inputs to subsequent sessions, delegates differed widely in the number of requested inputs.</p>
      <p>Some developed countries emphasized the need to avoid delay, while others sought a more comprehensive approach to increase the AGBM's options.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries requested minimal inputs, stating that a wealth of information already existed, while a few, mainly oil producing countries, emphasized the need for further study on the economic impacts.</p>

      <h2>SECOND SESSION OF THE AD HOC GROUP ON THE BERLIN MANDATE</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>The second session of the AGBM was held in Geneva from 30 October - 3 November 1995.</p>
      <p>Debate over the extent of analysis and assessment continued, but delegates also heard new ideas for the structure and form of a possible protocol.</p>
      <p>During the week-long meeting, delegates considered: strengthening of commitments in Article 4.2 (a) and (b), regarding policies and measures, as well as quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives within specified time-frames; advancing the implementation Article 4.1; and possible features of a protocol or other legal instrument. During the meeting, Spain, on behalf of the European Union, submitted an outline for a protocol or legal instrument.</p>
      <p>The outline did not include proposals on policies, measures, objectives or time-frames, but was organized on three principles: consistency with prior AGBM discussions; creating a dynamic instrument that can develop over time; and linking measures to existing Convention provisions where they apply.</p>
      <p>The outline includes six articles: commitments by developed and other Annex I Parties, including a section on voluntary application by non-Annex I Parties; commitments by all Parties; review of commitments; cross-references to FCCC articles; amendment procedures, including simplified procedures for annexes; and final clauses.</p>
      <p>It would include three annexes of policies and measures: those applicable to all Annex I Parties; those agreed as high priority in national programmes; and those to be considered in national programmes, as appropriate.</p>
      <p>While delegates did not decide to adopt this outline, they did agree that it merits further consideration.</p>

      <h2>SPAIN</h2>
      <p>Santiago Gomez-Acebo, on behalf of the European Union, said the EU reaffirms its commitment to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 and called upon the other Annex I Parties to the Convention to do the same.</p>
      <p>The decision contained in the Berlin Mandate - to begin a process for taking action beyond the year 2000, including the strengthening of commitments of the Parties included in Annex I - is a major achievement.</p>
      <p>The European Union trusts that the decision to establish the Secretariat of the Convention in Bonn will contribute to setting the future work of the Convention on solid ground.</p>
