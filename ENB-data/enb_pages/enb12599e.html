      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ADP PROCESS</h2>
      <small>working group — HISTORY</small>
      <p>The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992, which sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs to avoid 'dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system'.</p>
      <p>The Convention, which entered into force on 21 March 1994, now has 196 parties.</p>
      <p>In December 1997, COP 3 adopted the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC that committed industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission reduction targets.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005, and now has 192 parties.</p>

      <h2>DURBAN:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>The UN Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, took place from 28 November to 11 December 2011.</p>
      <p>The Durban outcomes covered a wide range of topics, notably the establishment of a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, and agreement to launch the ADP with a mandate 'to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties'.</p>
      <p>The ADP is scheduled to complete these negotiations by 2015, with the new instrument entering into force by 2020.</p>
      <p>In addition, the ADP was mandated to explore actions to close the pre-2020 ambition gap in relation to the 2 °C target.</p>
