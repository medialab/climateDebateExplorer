      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small>HISTORY</small>
      <p>The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992, which sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now has 192 parties.</p>
      <p>In December 1997, delegates at COP 3 in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission reduction targets.</p>
      <p>These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I parties, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005, and now has 184 parties.</p>
      <p>In 2005, the first Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties (COP/MOP 1) in Montreal, Canada, established the AWG-KP on the basis of Protocol Article 3.9, which mandates the consideration of Annex I parties further commitments at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period.</p>
      <p>In addition, COP 11 agreed in Montreal to consider long-term cooperation under the Convention through a series of four workshops known as the Convention Dialogue, which continued until COP 13 .</p>

      <h2>BALI ROADMAP:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 took place in December 2007, in Bali, Indonesia.</p>
      <p>The focus of the Bali conference was on long-term issues.</p>
      <p>These negotiations resulted in the adoption of the Bali Action Plan , which established the AWG-LCA to focus on four key elements of long-term cooperation identified during the Convention Dialogue: mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology.</p>
      <p>The Bali Action Plan contains a non-exhaustive list of issues to be considered under each of these areas and calls for articulating a shared vision for long-term cooperative action.</p>
      <p>The Bali conference also resulted in an agreement on a two-year process, the Bali Roadmap, which covers negotiation tracks under the Convention and the Protocol and sets a deadline for concluding the negotiations at COP 15 and COP/MOP 5, to be held in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
      <p>The two key bodies under the Bali Roadmap are the AWG-LCA and the AWG-KP, which held four negotiation sessions in 2008: April in Bangkok, Thailand; June in Bonn, Germany; August in Accra, Ghana; and December in Poznán, Poland.</p>

      <h2>COP 14:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>During COP 14 in Poznán, AWG-LCA 4 continued discussing all the key elements of the Bali Action Plan.</p>
      <p>It mandated the AWG-LCA Chair to prepare a document for consideration by AWG-LCA 5 that would focus negotiations on the fulfillment of the Bali Action Plan , and a negotiating text for AWG-LCA 6 in June 2009. AWG-KP 6 held a strategic discussion on all elements of its work programme and decided that in order to finalize agreement on Annex I parties further commitments at COP/MOP 5, the AWG-KP needs to consider in 2009 the aggregate scale of emission reductions by Annex I parties , and the contribution by parties individually or jointly to the aggregate scale, as well as other issues identified in paragraph 49 of its conclusions ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/8 ).</p>
      <p>These issues include: the flexibility mechanisms; LULUCF; greenhouse gases, sectors and sources; potential consequences of tools, policies, measures and methodologies; aviation and maritime bunker fuels; and legal matters.</p>

      <h2>AWG-LCA 5 &amp; AWG-KP 7</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>From 29 March 8 April 2009, AWG-LCA 5 and AWG-KP 7 convened in Bonn, Germany.</p>
      <p>The main objective of the session was to work towards negotiating text under both AWGs.</p>
      <p>The AWG-LCA considered a note prepared by the Chair to focus negotiations on the fulfillment of the Bali Action Plan and on the components of the agreed outcome (FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/4, Parts I and II ).</p>
      <p>Discussions at AWG-LCA 5 focused on further elaborating elements for a draft negotiating text to be prepared by the Chair for the next AWG-LCA session in June 2009.</p>
      <p>The focus in AWG-KP 7 was on emission reductions by Annex I parties under the Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012 and on legal issues, including possible amendments to the Protocol.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP also considered the other issues in its work programme, including the flexibility mechanisms, LULUCF and potential consequences of response measures.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP agreed to request its Chair to prepare two documents for the June session: a proposal for amendments to the Protocol under Article 3.9 (Annex I parties further commitments) ; and a text on other issues, such as LULUCF and the flexibility mechanisms.</p>

      <h2>DIALOGUE ON CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION FOR LAND AND WATER MANAGEMENT:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>The concluding Dialogue on Climate Change Adaptation for Land and Water Management was held at UNEP headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya from 16-17 April 2009.</p>
      <p>The event was co-hosted by UNEP and the Minister for Development Cooperation of Denmark, Ulla Tørnæs.</p>
      <p>The Dialogue addressed the need to: tackle existing problems in land and water management to build resilience to climate change; strengthen institutions for land and water management; and increase financing targeted towards the most vulnerable people.</p>

    <div id="section_6">
      <h2>IPCC 30:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) held its 30th session in Antalya, Turkey, from 21-23 April 2009.</p>
      <p>The meeting focused mainly on the scoping process for the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) with a view to providing guidance to the experts who are expected to define the AR5 outline during a meeting to be held in Venice, Italy, from 13-17 July 2009.</p>
      <p>The IPCC also decided to proceed with the preparation of a Special Report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters, and agreed to hold a number of expert meetings on topics, such as human settlements, and detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate change.</p>

    <div id="section_7">
      <h2>UNFCCC TECHNICAL WORKSHOP UNDER THE NAIROBI WORK PROGRAMME:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>The UNFCCC Technical Workshop on Increasing Economic Resilience to Climate Change and Reducing Reliance on Vulnerable Economic Sectors through Economic Diversification took place from 28-30 April 2009, in Cairo, Egypt.</p>
      <p>The workshop was convened under the NWP at SBSTA s request with a view to promoting understanding, as well as the development and dissemination of measures, methodologies and tools for increasing economic resilience, including the understanding of social aspects.</p>

    <div id="section_8">
      <h2>MAJOR ECONOMIES FORUMS:</h2>
      <small>SPECIAL WORKSHOP</small>
      <p>The Major Economies Forum held two meetings, from 27-28 April 2009 in Washington, DC, US, and from 25-26 May 2009 in Paris, France.</p>
      <p>These meetings served as preparatory sessions for a Major Economies Forum Leaders meeting that Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has agreed to host in La Maddalena, Italy, in July 2009.</p>
      <p>The 17 major economies invited to attend were: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
      <p>Denmark, in its capacity as the President of COP 15, and the UN were also invited.</p>
      <p>According to the Chair s Summary from the first Forum, participants shared the view that climate change is a clear and present danger, demanding immediate attention from all countries, and that the Major Economies Forum Leaders meeting in July should send a strong political signal to add momentum to the Copenhagen process and to collective efforts to achieve a low-carbon future.</p>
