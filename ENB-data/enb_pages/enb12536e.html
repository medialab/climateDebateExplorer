      <p>Honduras, for the CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM (SICA), called for progress on: adaptation in regions of high vulnerability enabled by adequate, predictable, sustained and additional financial resources; and the work programme on loss and damage that should focus on harm prevention and reduction rather than risk assessment.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>The Bonn Climate Change Conference opened on a sunny Monday morning.</p>
      <p>The mood of delegates gathering in the familiar surroundings of the Maritim Hotel was positive, although many joked that they now know the city and conference venue by heart.</p>
      <p>We ve had nearly a 6-month break in the formal negotiations, but many of us have already been spending quite a bit of time in Bonn recently for workshops and the informal meeting in early May.</p>
      <p>While the surroundings were well-known, there was also a feeling of anticipation regarding the post-Durban process, including the newly established ADP.</p>
      <p>Many commented that they were looking forward to commencing work under the new ADP on Wednesday; however, few seemed to have a clear sense of the timeline and substance.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the various new bodies were generating new dynamics in the process, ripe with rumors that nominations were proving difficult.</p>
      <p>This was confirmed in the evening, with the SBI plenary finishing business for the day without having resolved the process of how nominations for the various bodies should be considered.</p>
      <p>As the SBs opened, technology was very much on the agenda.</p>
      <p>Along with the ubiquitous iPads and iPhones sported by delegates, technology permeated conversation in the corridors with delegates expressing different views on the host of the CTC.</p>
      <p>The importance of resolving the issue came up in the SBSTA, SBI and a press conference with UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres.</p>
      <p>Some delegates favored the Caribbean as host, others emphasized the need for the CTC to be in a developing country, while one recommendation noted the Republic of Korea as an option due to their technological advancements.</p>
      <p>Whatever the case, technology will remain a key part of the climate conversation in Bonn.</p>
