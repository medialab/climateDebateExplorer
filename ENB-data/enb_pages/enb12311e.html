      <h2>ADAPTATION FUND:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>On the Fund's overarching principles (FCCC/SBI/2006/11*), the Philippines, for the G-77/CHINA, proposed a set of principles, including the COP/MOP's authority and guidance, accountability of the Fund to the COP/MOP , and funding covering full costs of adaptation.</p>
      <p>CANADA highlighted a country-driven approach, efficiency and effectiveness, and knowledge and networking capacity.</p>
      <p>The EU proposed shortening the list of principles and underscored synergies in the Fund management, procedures and accountability.</p>
      <p>BRAZIL opposed current references to knowledge and networking expertise.</p>
      <p>SOUTH AFRICA said the Fund should ensure decentralized access, mobilize additional resources, and reduce barriers.</p>
      <p>TUVALU emphasized a community-based approach.</p>
      <p>The contact group agreed to continue discussions on two tracks by developing a shorter list of principles while keeping the current compilation text.</p>
      <p>Informal consultations later in the afternoon focused on principles and modalities for the Fund.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_2">
      <h2>DEFORESTATION:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Co-Chair Rosland presented draft conclusions to the contact group.</p>
      <p>Having agreed on the need for a second workshop before SBSTA 26, discussion focused on its scope.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA proposed focusing on policy approaches and positive incentives and, once these are refined, looking at relevant technical questions and data needs.</p>
      <p>JAPAN, and the UK speaking for the EU, stressed the importance of also addressing technical and methodological issues.</p>
      <p>The US emphasized clarity on technical issues and, with CANADA, expressed concern with a request that the Secretariat compile a background document on common elements and differences between possible approaches.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_3">
      <h2>CAPACITY BUILDING (Convention)</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The group focused on monitoring capacity building and the GEF role under Decision 2/CP.7 (capacity building in developing countries).</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND and the EU welcomed the GEF development of indicators to monitor capacity building and proposed that the Secretariat compile monitoring information for the COP.</p>
      <p>The EU reminded parties that it is very difficult to quantify the monetary contributions to capacity building and that the sustainability of capacity building is more important.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4">
      <h2>PROTOCOL:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The contact group discussed whether it should consider the recommendations of the CDM Executive Board on capacity building, as suggested by the G-77/China.</p>
      <p>The EU, SWITZERLAND and JAPAN opposed this, stressing the need to focus on the current mandate, notably monitoring.</p>
      <p>The Co-Chairs will prepare draft text for discussion on Friday.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_5">
      <h2>AWG ISSUES:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Chair Zammit Cutajar suggested an approach to a programme of work based on clusters of quantitative and qualitative issues and invited parties to respond.</p>
      <p>On a long-term goal, NORWAY called for agreement at COP/MOP 2 and the EU cited its target of stabilizing temperatures at 2 C. NORWAY cautioned that national mitigation potential should not be automatically translated into commitments, and encouraged a global perspective.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA supported an approach beginning with assessment of mitigation potential for Annex I parties and relating this to a possible range of targets or ambition.</p>
      <p>CANADA called for an examination of policy tools, particularly LULUCF and, with JAPAN, for sectoral approaches.</p>
      <p>The EU said it would be insufficient to look at the potential for only a number of parties.</p>
      <p>He compared the Kyoto Protocol to a Nairobi matatu bus, when what is actually needed is a spacecraft.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA cautioned against moving away from the Protocol.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_6">
      <h2>TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In informal consultations, the Co-Chairs presented draft text that sought to integrate proposals from drafts submitted the previous day by the G-77/China and EU.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_7">
      <h2>ADAPTATION PROGRAMME OF WORK:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In informal consultations, progress was reported on both technical and substantive matters, as parties sought common language in the chapeau paragraphs and worked through technical details of the list of initial activities.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_8">
      <h2>IN THE BREEZEWAYS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Long-term issues were the talk of the corridors Thursday.</p>
      <p>The first discussions under Protocol Article 9 were widely anticipated by some, given many people view of this as part of the multi-track process on long-term action.</p>
      <p>In the event, though, the discussion was viewed as interesting, but not earth-shattering, as parties generally reiterated their known positions.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the Russian proposal on voluntary commitments met staunch opposition from the G-77/China in plenary, even though some suggested that a number of developing countries may privately be somewhat sympathetic.</p>
      <p>It not all over yet, said one delegate.</p>
      <p>In other developments, participants were starting to talk about Kofi Annan visit to Nairobi to address next week high-level segment. IN THE BREEZEWAYS II (FROM WASHINGTON TO NAIROBI) Insiders are discussing the potential impact of the US mid-term elections both in Washington and here in Nairobi.</p>
      <p>The Democratic Party change in electoral fortunes seems to have raised expectations massively among the climate policy community, with a number of possibilities viewed on the horizon.</p>
      <p>Some expect that the passage of various climate-related bills may be accelerated through Congress, and there is even speculation about a real possibility that the new leadership on the Hill may opt to include climate change as a wedge issue in the next Presidential election.</p>
      <p>It is also expected by some that the political shake up in Washington may end a moratorium on certain fields of study, which some claim has deprived legislators of important research.</p>
      <p>In Nairobi, observers will be watching for shifts in the US position in the discussions on the AWG, the Article 9 review and the Dialogue session.</p>
