      <h2>AD HOC WORKING GROUP</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>The AWG convened informal consultations on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>Chair Zammit Cutajar presented his initial views, noting that the AWG aims to amend Protocol Annex B.</p>
      <p>He proposed structuring discussions around three areas: evaluation; innovation (including questions on burden sharing, mechanisms, targets, a sectoral approach, technology transfer and bunker fuels); and ambition (including mitigation potential and contribution to the ultimate objective of the Convention).</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA said there is no linkage to other discussions, the outcome should be substantially higher reduction targets, and the task should be completed by 2008.</p>
      <p>INDIA and CHINA stressed that the AWG simply needs to decide on new quantitative commitments and the length of the second commitment period. JAPAN said the second commitment period should be based on a thorough scientific analysis and not a political exercise.</p>
      <p>He said the next commitment period should aim to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention on its own.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND, NEW ZEALAND and others underscored linkages between Articles 3.9 and 9.</p>
      <p>The EU restated its target (15-50% by 2050).</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA and others asked about the origin of the EU figures.</p>
      <p>Negotiations will continue bilaterally and possibly in an informal contact group on Monday.</p>

      <p>Co-chairs Rosland and Carlino will present a proposal on Friday.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_25">
      <h2>ADAPTATION:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Co-Chair Plume proposed using the tables on initial activities listed in the report of the Vienna workshop (FCCC/SBSTA/2006/4) as a basis for discussions.</p>
      <p>The group will reconvene on Friday.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_26">
      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Discussions on future commitments under Kyoto Article 3.9 dominated chatter in the corridors on Thursday, as informal consultations under the AWG got underway.</p>
      <p>Before the evening session, several participants were cautious that a great deal of time would be spent on this issue over the coming days with relatively modest results.</p>
      <p>The chorus of those singing a similar tune was even larger by the time the session ended, as it became apparent that parties positions were already quite rigid, and that finding common ground could be extremely difficult.</p>
      <p>In the words on one observer, it could require a superhuman effort from AWG Chair Zammit Cutajar.</p>
      <p>Many were also focused on the possibility that the dark clouds gathering outside the conference center would soon become a feature inside, as the SBI turns its attention to the financial mechanism on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Initial discussions in the session on non-Annex I communications concerning the GEF did little to dispel this feeling, and left several feeling uneasy about the impending discussion as they made their way to the EU reception on Thursday night.</p>
