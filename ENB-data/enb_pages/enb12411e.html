      <h2>ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Stressing the need to enter into full negotiating mode, AWG-LCA Chair Michael Zammit Cutajar (Malta) opened the session and parties adopted the agenda ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/6 ).</p>
      <p>On the organization of work ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/7 ), parties agreed to a first reading of the negotiating text in an informal plenary.</p>
      <p>AWG-LCA Chair Zammit Cutajar said the next steps would be decided after the first reading.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to informal consultations on the legal form of the outcome and further organization of work.</p>

    <div id="section_2">
      <h2>OPENING STATEMENTS:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Sudan, for the G-77/CHINA, highlighted the meeting as a turning point for the AWG-LCA, with commencement of substantive discussions on the content and form of an agreed outcome in Copenhagen.</p>
      <p>He noted that the negotiating text should contain a more balanced and clear reflection of the Group s proposals.</p>
      <p>Algeria, for the AFRICAN GROUP, expressed concern that the negotiating text did not reflect the views of all parties in an equitable and balanced manner and said some of its elements were not consistent with the Convention.</p>
      <p>On mitigation, she identified the need to maintain a firewall between developed country commitments and developing country actions, called for adequate funding for REDD pilot projects and expressed concern with sectoral approaches.</p>
      <p>Lesotho, for the LDCs, said the text should consider the needs of the most vulnerable countries and the requisite enhanced action on adaptation.</p>
      <p>Grenada, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), cautioned that time is running out, and that the level of ambition in the Copenhagen outcome would determine the survival of small island developing states.</p>
      <p>The Czech Republic, for the EU, and Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, welcomed the text as a starting point for negotiations.</p>
      <p>The EU stressed interconnections between the different building blocks and interlinkages with the AWG-KP.</p>
      <p>Mexico, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, supported, inter alia, a mid-term target by 2020, assessing technology needs, and coordination between the AWGs.</p>
      <p>The UMBRELLA GROUP urged consistency and coherence between the AWGs.</p>
      <p>She also supported flexibility to reflect the full spectrum of mitigation efforts, and near-term commitments and actions, and long-term pathways for all parties.</p>
      <p>BELARUS advocated combining the two AWGs at this session and considering a single negotiating text under one AWG. MALI said each AWG should continue to work separately until Copenhagen, and CHINA supported the continuation of double-track negotiations under the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP.</p>
      <p>He emphasized that developed countries should commit to ambitious emission reductions, as well as meet developing country needs for finance, technology transfer and capacity building.</p>
      <p>BOLIVIA said the text is unbalanced and requires substantial changes.</p>
      <p>INDIA said that: the text required greater balance; proposals not compatible with the Convention should be excluded; and paragraphs should reference the specific Convention Articles whose implementation they aim to enhance.</p>
      <p>He proposed addressing technology and finance in two distinct sections. SAUDI ARABIA expressed concern that many proposals in the negotiating text go beyond the Convention and the Bali Action Plan.</p>
      <p>He opposed proposals to merge the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA, as well as proposals that would pass the burden from developed to developing countries.</p>
      <p>The PHILIPPINES lamented that the text on developing country mitigation is several pages longer than the text on developed country mitigation.</p>
      <p>AWG-LCA Chair Zammit Cutajar replied that the length reflects the number of interesting proposals on developing country mitigation, and encouraged parties to elaborate on their ideas on other issues.</p>
      <p>The US highlighted ongoing work on draft legislation to reduce emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, and 83% by 2050.</p>
      <p>He expressed dismay with the text s structure, and concern over the proposal to close negotiations from observers after the first reading of the text.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA called for a strong outcome on mitigation.</p>
      <p>She said a spectrum of mitigation efforts was needed and that the LDCs should be fully supported in their efforts.</p>
      <p>The REPUBLIC OF KOREA highlighted the Seoul initiative for Low-carbon Green Growth in East Asia, and proposed: a paradigm shift toward low-carbon development; a registry for nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs); and a crediting mechanism for NAMAs.</p>
      <p>The RUSSIAN FEDERATION called for commitments from all major emitters and burden sharing, taking into account country specificities and levels of economic development.</p>
      <p>He said historical responsibility should not be interpreted as a basis for imposing commitments on only developed countries.</p>
      <p>He also highlighted the recent Russian climate change doctrine document, saying it provides the conceptual foundation for long-term practical measures and shows that Russia is prepared to make a fair contribution. INDONESIA highlighted the Manado Ocean Declaration, adopted in May 2009, which identified the urgent need to address the impact of sea level rise.</p>
      <p>BENIN called for a funding mechanism, which should, inter alia, promote effective technology transfer.</p>
      <p>COLOMBIA urged greater emphasis on adaptation in the text and called for new, additional and predictable resources to support adaptation.</p>
      <p>EGYPT called for a balanced and fair agreement, and working in parallel with the AWG-KP.</p>
      <p>MAURITANIA stressed the need to speed up the translation of the negotiating text. ARGENTINA highlighted that the four pillars of the Bali Action Plan are intrinsically related, and emphasized that the texts on mitigation and adaptation should also address finance and implementation.</p>
      <p>He called for global objectives, and said both production and consumption should be addressed.</p>
      <p>PERU stressed the link between the intensity of mitigation efforts and cost of adaptation.</p>
      <p>GUYANA urged progress on the role of forests, including REDD, sustainable forest management and conservation.</p>
      <p>PAKISTAN highlighted finance and technology and called for a clear, strong and cohesive institutional architecture, including a climate technology transfer mechanism.</p>
      <p>URUGUAY stressed the need to address mitigation in the agricultural sector, identifying the need for global cooperation on research and development, and for a mechanism to facilitate technology transfer.</p>
      <p>TOGO stressed the need to ensure the survival of future generations and to drop selfish attitudes.</p>
      <p>The WORLD BUSINESS COUNCIL ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT highlighted the key role that business could play in a post-2012 framework to stimulate investment and development, and noted that the global economic crisis points to the need for a sustainable low-emissions pathway.</p>
      <p>The CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK said the text contains options that could lead to destructive tipping points, and lacks ambition and a sense of urgency.</p>
      <p>The THIRD WORLD NETWORK described the submissions of several developed country parties as a substantial deviation from the Convention and the Bali Action Plan.</p>
      <p>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES ORGANIZATIONS said any reference to REDD in the agreed outcome should include respect for indigenous rights and prior informed consent.</p>

      <h2>LONG-TERM COOPERATIVE ACTION:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>AWG-LCA Chair Zammit Cutajar and the Secretariat introduced the relevant documents (FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/7-9; FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/MISC.4 parts I II and Adds.</p>
      <p>1 2 ; and FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/MISC.5 ).</p>
      <p>The Secretariat also noted a proposal from Japan for a draft protocol to the Convention ( FCCC/CP/2009/3 ) to be communicated to parties in accordance with Convention Article 17 (Protocols).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4">
      <h2>ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>AWG-KP Chair John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) highlighted the six-month rule, noting that Protocol amendments proposed for adoption in Copenhagen must be communicated to parties by 17 June 2009.</p>
      <p>Parties adopted the agenda and organization of work ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/6 ).</p>
      <p>They agreed to take up together the sub-item on proposals for Protocol amendments pursuant to Article 3.9 (Annex I further commitments) and the sub-item on proposals on other issues in the AWG-KP s work programme.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_5">
      <h2>OPENING STATEMENTS:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Sudan, for the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern at the extremely slow progress in completing milestones under the AWG-KP s work programme.</p>
      <p>He lamented that the agenda for AWG-KP 8 does not include items on central tasks, especially those in paragraphs 49(a) and (b) of the work programme ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/8 ) relating to Annex I aggregate and individual or joint emission reductions.</p>
      <p>Grenada, for AOSIS, stated that the unilateral targets presented by Annex I parties so far have virtually no chance of limiting global warming to below 2°C, and called for a 45% reduction in Annex I emissions from 1990 levels by 2020 and a reduction of more than 90% from 1990 levels by 2050.</p>
      <p>Algeria, for the AFRICAN GROUP, emphasized that the AWG-KP s mandate is to specify further emission reduction commitments for Annex I parties, and stressed the need for a firewall between the AWG-KP and other processes.</p>
      <p>Lesotho, for the LDCs, urged agreement on ambitious emission reductions, stressing that a delay could threaten a successful outcome in Copenhagen.</p>
      <p>INDONESIA urged the AWG-KP to work efficiently on Annex I emission reductions.</p>
      <p>INDIA called on Annex I parties to propose targets based on objective criteria and reflecting comparability of efforts, and SAUDI ARABIA welcomed discussions on potential consequences. VENEZUELA stated that consideration of the flexibility mechanisms is beyond the mandate of the AWG-KP and PAKISTAN said Annex I commitments must not be linked to any conditions.</p>
      <p>MALAYSIA stressed the need to focus on amendment of Protocol Annex B, stating other issues could be considered later.</p>
      <p>TUVALU stated that discussions must go beyond Annex B amendments in order to address issues such as extending the share of proceeds.</p>
      <p>COLOMBIA supported extending the share of proceeds to joint implementation and emissions trading.</p>
      <p>The EU noted synergies between the AWGs and underscored that the AWG-KP s mandate allows discussion of all issues affecting Annex I parties further commitments.</p>
      <p>Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, suggested 2020 as the end of the second commitment period, and stressed the importance of discussing general improvements to the Protocol.</p>
      <p>He supported functional coordination between the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, stated that the texts on Annex I parties further commitments and other issues must be considered as a package, and urged consistency and coherence between the AWGs.</p>
      <p>JAPAN called for a comprehensive post-2012 framework, stating that a simple Protocol amendment would be an unacceptable outcome, and stressing the need for mitigation by all major economies.</p>
      <p>The RUSSIAN FEDERATION explained that his country s participation in the second commitment period would be assessed in accordance with national legislation and highlighted that the current Protocol is not a fair and comprehensive agreement.</p>
      <p>He called for merging the two AWGs and ensuring a single agreement under the Convention, which would bring together all major emitters.</p>
      <p>BELARUS noted the need to simplify procedures for joining Annex B, and urged synergy between the two AWGs. TURKEY highlighted its recent ratification of the Protocol, and CROATIA outlined plans to, inter alia, increase the use of renewable energy and biofuels, and improve energy efficiency.</p>
      <p>She called for recognition of her country s special circumstances as a country negotiating both a post-2012 target and EU membership. CANADA stated that a firm understanding of the rules is necessary to enable Annex I parties determine proper commitments.</p>
      <p>NEW ZEALAND stated that a long-term quantified global goal for emission reductions is the single most important step to advancing negotiations.</p>
      <p>He highlighted that New Zealand s commitment would have to take into account the large uncertainty of LULUCF rules, and stressed the importance of including LULUCF in the Copenhagen package. PAPUA NEW GUINEA said neither the current nor proposed LULUCF rules demonstrate leadership by Annex I parties, stating that the rules would allow erosion of Annex I parties mitigation commitments.</p>
      <p>Lamenting the exclusion of his country s proposal for a land-based approach from the text, he stressed it would ensure environmental integrity and account for all emissions and removals. FRIENDS OF THE EARTH INTERNATIONAL called attention to the cost of failure to reach an ambitious agreement, and called for an end to offsetting.</p>
      <p>CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK called for an aggregate Annex I emission reduction target of more than 40% from 1990 levels by 2020. BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY highlighted the potential of sectoral crediting proposals and NAMAs to transform the flexibility mechanisms.</p>

BOLIVIA urged that the time allocation reflect the importance of emission targets and legal matters.</p>
      <p>The IPCC reported on the workshop on alternative greenhouse gas metrics, highlighting that: the effectiveness of a metric depends on the policy goal it seeks to address; the global warming potential metric was not designed with a particular policy goal in mind; and depending on the relevant policy or goals, alternative metrics may be preferable. ICELAND highlighted his country s recent decision on a 15% reduction target by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA pledged a reduction of 25% below 2000 levels by 2020, in the context of an ambitious international agreement.</p>

      <p>Many expressed cautious optimism about what they felt had been constructive plenary discussions under the AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>Although there were some diverging views over the contents of the Chair s negotiating text, most delegates were happy that agreement had been reached to discuss it further in informal plenary sessions.</p>
      <p>Some developed country delegates said, however, that they would have preferred to dedicate more attention to the legal framework, pointing out that only one hour of informals is currently allocated for what they felt was an important topic.</p>
      <p>On the AWG-KP, a group of negotiators joked that the two AWGs had switched places, with one commenting, everything looked so smooth in the AWG-KP last year, but now the gloves seem to be coming off.</p>
      <p>The AWG-KP s opening plenary was delayed by more than an hour while parties consulted informally over mandate issues and the structure and number of possible contact groups.</p>
      <p>The result three different contact groups on Annex I further commitments considering the same two texts, was, as one delegate put it, an arrangement that everyone can live with but no one is happy about.</p>
