      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>SBI/SBSTA — corridors</small>
      <p>Despite the previous weeks apparent lack of momentum, the final week of the meeting began with an intense schedule of contact groups, leaving delegations exhausted, if only from running around the Maritim.</p>
      <p>Some observers felt that many of the discussions saw at least the creation of a basis for progress, with important ground-work laid in the contact groups on adaptation and mitigation, and on national communications.</p>
      <p>Others feared entrenchment of negotiating positions on accounting for sinks would heat up the rest of the week.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12238e_2">
      <h2>ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION</h2>
      <p>Chair Benrageb reported on the in-session workshops on adaptation and mitigation.</p>
      <p>SOUTH AFRICA, for the Africa Group, supported by the G-77/CHINA, AOSIS, and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, called for separate contact groups on adaptation and mitigation.</p>
      <p>JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, the US and EU supported one contact group.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA, with several Parties, suggested future in-session workshops.</p>
      <p>The RUSSIAN FEDERATION underscored addressing mitigation at the regional level.</p>
      <p>Many Parties stressed the importance of regional modeling, and noted the importance of integrating sustainable development policies with adaptation measures.</p>
      <p>The US highlighted innovative technologies.</p>
      <p>PERU suggested separating short-term needs from long-term effects of climate change.</p>
      <p>MAURITIUS stressed increasing adaptive capacity of vulnerable Parties.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA called for addressing the impacts of response measures.</p>
      <p>The INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE OF TRIBAL PEOPLES OF THE TROPICAL FORESTS emphasized the need to consider the concerns, rights and knowledge of indigenous peoples when developing adaptation strategies.</p>
      <p>The WORLD AGROFORESTRY CENTER called for broadening the debate beyond a technological focus.</p>
      <p>Chair Benrageb proposed to have one contact group co-chaired by David Warrilow (UK) and Kok Seng Yap (Malaysia), with separate draft conclusions for each item.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12238e_3">
      <h2>UNFCCC ARTICLE 6</h2>
      <p>Chair Markus Nauser opened discussions on a paper consolidating Parties views and guidance to the Secretariat for inclusion in the terms of reference for potential clearing house contractors.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA called for reference to clear timelines and financial resources, and suggested inviting private sector involvement in the development of the clearing house.</p>
      <p>Chair Nauser cautioned against setting a schedule, as financing for activities remains unresolved.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA suggested identifying costs as an initial task, and stressed the importance of ensuring sustained financial flow for activities.</p>
      <p>The EU, supported by NEW ZEALAND and the G-77/CHINA, suggested proceeding with the call for tenders, while mentioning that any or none may be chosen.</p>

      <p>On arrangements for COP-10, the EU, CANADA and others supported the themes as proposed for discussion in the high-level segment.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA, with others, opposed by NORWAY, AOSIS, BURKINA FASO and SOUTH AFRICA, suggested abandoning proposed discussions on energy.</p>
      <p>The US, supported by the G-77/CHINA, and opposed by the EU, called for reviewing the approach for selecting constituencies.</p>
      <p>On effective participation in the UNFCCC process, the US, opposed by the EU, called for text clarifying that participation includes physical presence, and suggested reviewing the issue at SBI-22.</p>
      <p>NORWAY pointed to financial implications of ensuring physical presence of all Parties in all meetings related to the process.</p>
      <p>Delegates exchanged views on textual proposals regarding participation of indigenous peoples.</p>
      <p>While some Parties supported exploring opportunities for participation by indigenous peoples, others felt representation on national delegations would be sufficient.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12238e_5">
      <h2>NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
      <p>Chair Sok Appadu invited delegates to discuss proposals from the US and EU on submission of non-Annex I national communications.</p>
      <p>Regarding the US proposal, which requests Parties to submit greenhouse gas inventories every two years, BRAZIL, for the G-77/China, with others, raised concerns that the proposal would impose additional costs.</p>
      <p>In its proposal, the EU suggested a submission cycle of around 5 years, and emphasized continuity.</p>
      <p>While agreeing to consider it, the G-77/CHINA stressed that the proposal did not take into account delays in funding disbursement.</p>
      <p>Parties discussed, inter alia, the GEF funding guidelines and the timing of funds for preparing subsequent national communications, while work on the previous one is being completed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12238e_6">
      <h2>CAPACITY BUILDING</h2>
      <p>Continuing negotiations on the draft conclusions, delegates commented on reference to a technical meeting to complete the review of the effectiveness and range of capacity-building activities in developing countries.</p>
      <p>JAPAN opposed reference that would make the completion of the review conditional on input from such a meeting, while the EU agreed that further work is needed to complete the review.</p>
      <p>She suggested a round-table discussion at COP-10.</p>
      <p>Parties considered various options.</p>
      <p>The text remained bracketed.</p>
      <p>Delegates also discussed dates for submitting information on the effectiveness of capacity-building activities by EITs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12238e_7">
      <h2>P&amp;MS</h2>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA emphasized the importance of emissions reductions and information sharing by Annex I Parties, and minimizing adverse effects, including of P&amp;Ms.</p>
      <p>The EU urged avoiding selective quoting and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of decision 13/CP.7 (P&amp;Ms).</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to use the latest version of a non-paper from COP-9, with an amendment proposed by Saudi Arabia, as the basis for discussion.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/China, said the draft conclusions should not be considered approved until agreement is reached on all paragraphs.</p>
      <p>The LDCs said that the G-77/China did not have a consensus position on P&amp;Ms.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA suggested removing reference to a status report on information exchange and deleting text on the Secretariats role in considering relevant on-going activities under other agenda items and those undertaken by international and intergovernmental organizations.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12238e_8">
      <h2>TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER</h2>
      <p>Parties continued discussions on new draft conclusions.</p>
      <p>Delegates discussed reference to additional regional workshops and the establishment of national databases of technology needs assessments.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Kishan Kumarsingh requested the EU, US, CHINA, JAPAN and other interested Parties to consult informally.</p>
      <p>Regarding topics for consideration for the EGTTs 2005 work programme, GHANA stressed the importance for the EGTT to identify, assess and prioritize joint research programmes between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties.</p>
      <p>Parties deliberated the extent to which the EGTT has the authority to prioritize activities, and agreed to a proposal by CANADA to request the EGTT to identify possible joint research programmes.</p>
      <p>Parties then discussed alternatives for text referring to the TT:CLEAR survey, and the deadline for submissions on enhancing the implementation of the framework for technology transfer for a possible COP-10 decision.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12238e_9">
