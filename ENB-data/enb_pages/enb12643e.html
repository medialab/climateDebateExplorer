      <h2>ADAPTATION AND LOSS AND DAMAGE</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Andrea Guerrero (Colombia) co-facilitated the session.</p>
      <p>Reporting back from the spin-off on loss and damage, GRENADA highlighted two proposals: from the G-77/China, placing a loss and damage mechanism with a climate displacement coordination facility in the agreement, noting that this mechanism would replace the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) after 2020; and from the US, the EU, Switzerland and Australia, addressing loss and damage through COP decisions, and capturing the WIM’s permanence.</p>
      <p>Co-Facilitator Guerrero summarized the spin-off’s discussions on adaptation, including: the possibility of a long-term global goal or vision to reduce vulnerability and increase adaptive capacity; and potential means to achieve such a vision, including sharing knowledge, MOI, and improving science.</p>
      <p>Spin-offs met in the afternoon to consider textual proposals.</p>

      <h2>MITIGATION</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>This session was co-facilitated by Franz Perrez (Switzerland).</p>
      <p>On collective efforts, CHINA suggested focusing on providing a long-term objective.</p>
      <p>Colombia, for AILAC, said the section on general/objective should include a global goal, to be operationalized in relevant sections of the agreement.</p>
      <p>CANADA noted that COP decisions are appropriate to enable action in line with the latest science.</p>
      <p>On differentiation, AILAC supported reference to commitments by all parties.</p>
      <p>NEW ZEALAND, CANADA and JAPAN said language on differentiation belongs to the paragraph on individual efforts.</p>
      <p>A number of developing countries said collective efforts should be linked to CBDR, equity and Convention Article 4 (commitments).</p>
      <p>INDIA, with CHINA, said individual efforts would operationalize differentiation of collective efforts.</p>
      <p>NEW ZEALAND, with the US, said the agreement would recognize differentiation but emphasized the need for a common, collective effort.</p>
      <p>NORWAY suggested that the collective efforts paragraph provide a framework for individual efforts.</p>
      <p>The MARSHALL ISLANDS called for clarity on the relationship between the general/objective section and collective efforts on mitigation.</p>
      <p>Co-Facilitator Perrez said discussions would inform his input to the ADP Co-Chairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_3">
      <h2>TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND DEVELOPMENT</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu (the Democratic Republic of Congo) co-facilitated the session.</p>
      <p>CANADA reported on Wednesday’s spin-offs, noting constructive discussions on the framework for enhanced action, and presenting a list of key aspects of the technology section.</p>
      <p>The EU and the US highlighted convergence on the role and importance of technology, cooperative action and anchoring institutions.</p>
      <p>Swaziland, for the AFRICAN GROUP, suggested further work on periodic assessments of institutional arrangements through COP decisions.</p>
      <p>The EU stated that a COP decision could strengthen institutions, while IRAN preferred doing so in the agreement.</p>
      <p>JAPAN called for the framework for enhanced action to be in a COP decision.</p>
      <p>INDIA underlined that the agreement could be the “final reinforcement” of the framework and reflect its durability.</p>
      <p>The UNITED ARAB EMIRATES said the framework could feature in both the agreement and a COP decision, the former explaining “the what” and the latter “the how.” Co-Facilitator Mpanu-Mpanu encouraged the spin-off to engage in a drafting exercise on cooperative action, the framework and institutions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4">
      <h2>TRANSPARENCY</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>This session was co-facilitated by Fook Seng Kwok (Singapore).</p>
      <p>ALGERIA called for avoiding a mitigation-centric MRV system.</p>
      <p>Singapore, for AOSIS, presented a framing paragraph for this section of the agreement, conveying that developed countries shall provide adequate support for effective participation of developing countries in the transparency system.</p>
      <p>China, for the LMDCs, presented a proposal that, inter alia, reflects that the extent to which developing countries can implement MRV arrangements will depend on developed countries’ financial support.</p>
      <p>The EU underlined that textual proposals should be “bridging,” which she said implies a prior discussion among parties with varying views.</p>
      <p>INDIA and BRAZIL called for capturing the full scope of “support.” The US suggested spelling out the capacity-building aspect.</p>
      <p>The EU reported that Wednesday’s spin-off had identified various ways accounting can be used, and had compiled different, though not necessarily contradictory, perspectives on accountability.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to hold a final informal meeting to hear suggestions on elements for the agreement versus decisions, and on clarifying the different types of support.</p>

    <div id="section_5">
      <h2>TIMEFRAMES</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>This session was co-facilitated by Roberto Dondisch (Mexico).</p>
      <p>Adaptation and finance Co-Facilitators, respectively Andrea Guerrero and Diann Black-Layne, reported on discussions relating to timing in their groups.</p>
      <p>Parties then discussed a list of key elements presented by Co-Facilitator Dondisch.</p>
      <p>Many supported including a general stocktaking of global progress in the agreement.</p>
      <p>BRAZIL suggested the agreement establish a process for the stocktaking, with inputs deriving from existing processes under the Convention, such as the review of the adequacy of finance; and output timed at least one year before parties submit revised NDCs.</p>
      <p>The EU suggested a synthesis report coming out of the stocktaking.</p>
      <p>Several parties emphasized the voluntary nature of adjustments to NDCs, with the EU underlining this should be compatible with progress towards a long-term goal in the agreement.</p>
      <p>The US suggested different treatment of adaptation and mitigation under timeframes.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe, for the AFRICAN GROUP, called for an article defining communication of the different types of undertakings, with flexibility for parties with limited capacity.</p>
      <p>Tuvalu, for the LDCs, suggested that: the term “NDCs” refers to mitigation; the term “contributions” does not apply to adaptation; and a parallel timing process for MOI is needed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_6">
      <h2>FINANCE</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Georg Børsting (Norway) co-facilitated this session.</p>
      <p>Reporting back from spin-off discussions on scale, ECUADOR noted difficulty in disentangling cross-cutting issues.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND summarized spin-off discussions on sources, highlighting a common view that sources could not be limited to a single option.</p>
      <p>Parties then proceeded to discuss four proposals on institutional arrangements from the G-77/China, the Republic of Korea, the EU, and a joint proposal by the US, Japan and Canada.</p>
      <p>South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, noted commonalities across proposals, such as the financial mechanism under Convention Article 11 (Financial Mechanism) serving as the financial mechanism of the new agreement.</p>
      <p>Supported by BOLIVIA, he opposed the Republic of Korea’s proposal to designate the Green Climate Fund (GCF) as the “main” operating entity of the agreement, noting that it would re-open the GCF’s governing instrument.</p>
      <p>NORWAY expressed concern about the G-77/China proposal to list existing funds under the Convention in the agreement.</p>
      <p>The EU emphasized flexibility and stressed the need for the COP to retain full authority to decide on operational matters of the funds.</p>
      <p>Noting overlap across the proposals, Co-Facilitator Børsting encouraged parties to submit bridging proposals.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_7">
      <h2>PREAMBLE</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Co-Facilitator George Wamukoya (Kenya) recalled that the Wednesday spin-off had agreed on five concepts: reference to the Convention; science; the sustainable development agenda; integrity; and issues related to SIDS and LDCs.</p>
      <p>Reporting on informal discussions held after the spin-off, BOTSWANA said a group of parties was unable to agree on the mode of work and had not engaged in substantive discussions.</p>
      <p>BOLIVIA and GUATEMALA reported that some parties agreed on a list of concepts for possible inclusion in the preamble.</p>
      <p>After a procedural discussion, parties presented views on the concept of integrity.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA said discussing the preamble is premature.</p>
      <p>The EU called for referencing human rights, while ZAMBIA expressed discomfort with such a reference.</p>
      <p>Many countries supported referring to gender equality and indigenous peoples.</p>
      <p>BOLIVIA and ECUADOR stressed references to Mother Earth.</p>
      <p>The US opposed references to the right to sustainable development.</p>
      <p>SWITZERLAND, with AUSTRALIA and VENEZUELA, supported including health.</p>
      <p>Co-Facilitator Wamukoya indicated that he would circulate a summary of discussions in the evening, noting that parties’ comments on it would be part of the Co-Facilitators’ inputs to the ADP Co-Chairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_8">
      <h2>IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLIANCE</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Sarah Baashan (Saudi Arabia) co-facilitated the session.</p>
      <p>Discussions focused on ways to facilitate implementation of and compliance with the new agreement.</p>
      <p>On the facilitative nature, the US drew attention to her proposal for a multilateral consultative process.</p>
      <p>Colombia, for AILAC, described the facilitative nature of the Basel Convention’s Implementation and Compliance Committee, which in non-compliance cases is competent to recognize and assist with capacity needs, and advises the COP to make cautionary statements.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA warned that providing for alternative avenues to access financial support through non-compliance could create adverse incentives.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA noted that intentional non-compliance would trigger the dispute settlement provision in the agreement.</p>
      <p>The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said criteria for determining parties’ intention would need to be clarified.</p>
      <p>CHINA noted the preference of some parties for an implementation branch and inquired about the scope of a compliance branch.</p>
      <p>The EU called for a mechanism that looks into parties’ performance and has adequate triggers.</p>
      <p>She noted the link to transparency and the MRV system.</p>
      <p>The BAHAMAS suggested the facilitative method be both forward and backward looking.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_9">
      <h2>CAPACITY BUILDING</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Artur Runge-Metzger (EU) co-facilitated the group.</p>
      <p>JAPAN reported on the institutional arrangements spin-off, noting that parties had not reached the “bridging” stage.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA reported that the pre-2020 milestone spin-off group was not able to draft compromise text.</p>
      <p>SWAZILAND, JAPAN and UGANDA called for a specific discussion on which existing institutions could be strengthened and how, with Senegal, for the LDCs, Jamaica, for AOSIS, and China, for the G-77/CHINA, questioning whether the Durban Forum on Capacity-building could address existing gaps, as suggested by the US.</p>
      <p>INDIA, with the G-77/CHINA, Saudi Arabia, for the LMDCs, and SUDAN requested the option for new institutional arrangements be moved to Part 1 of the Tool on the agreement.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA underlined that some paragraphs in Part 1 had not yet been discussed, but may attract broad agreement.</p>
      <p>Co-Facilitator Runge-Metzger noted consensus on the need to make enhancing capacity building a central part of the agreement, with disagreement on whether it will be enhanced through existing or new institutions.</p>
      <p>He said the Co-Facilitators would capture the discussion in text and gather parties’ reactions on Friday.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_10">
      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>As negotiations moved toward the last day, delegates ruminated both on what the outcome of the session could be, and on samples of Ben and Jerry’s latest ice-cream flavor, “Save Our Swirled (SOS),” which were offered at the Bonn conference center.</p>
      <p>Some described Wednesday’s stocktaking session as a “waste of time,” noting a lingering lack of clarity on process and where things stand on each issue.</p>
      <p>Yet, maybe a little sweetness, combined with Wednesday’s reprimand from the Co-Chairs, helped.</p>
      <p>Some noted more parties “reaching across the aisle” and welcomed a few textual proposals trickling into the spin-offs and facilitated discussions, in particular those on finance and on loss and damage.</p>
      <p>As some parties start considering guidance to the ADP Co-Chairs on their possible intersessional work before the October meeting, one observer quipped “let’s hope the signal from Bonn isn’t an SOS.”</p>
