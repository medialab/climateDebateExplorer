      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small>HISTORY</small>
      <p>Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to sustainable development, with negative impacts expected on human health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural resources, and physical infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Global climate varies naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of anthropogenically emitted greenhouse gases in the Earths atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate.</p>
      <p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of climate change have already been observed, and a majority of scientists believe that precautionary and prompt action is necessary. The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous anthropogenic interference' with the climate system.</p>
      <p>Controlled gases include methane, nitrous oxide, and, in particular, carbon dioxide.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, it now has 188 Parties.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_2">
      <h2>THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP-1) established the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate, and charged it with reaching agreement on strengthening efforts to combat climate change.</p>
      <p>Following intense negotiations culminating at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, delegates agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed countries and countries making the transition to a market economy to achieve quantified emission reduction targets.</p>
      <p>These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at least 5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.</p>
      <p>The Protocol also established three mechanisms to assist Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets cost-effectively: an emissions trading system; joint implementation (JI) of emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties; and a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) that encourages projects in non-Annex I (developing country) Parties. At subsequent meetings, Parties negotiated most of the rules and operational details determining how countries will cut emissions and measure and assess emissions reductions.</p>
      <p>To enter into force, the Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the UNFCCC, and by Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990.</p>
      <p>To date, 120 Parties have ratified the Protocol, including 32 Annex I Parties, representing 44.2% of the emissions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_3">
      <h2>THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In November 1998, Parties met at COP-4 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and agreed to a set of decisions known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA).</p>
      <p>The BAPA set COP-6 as the deadline for reaching agreement on the operational details of the Protocol and on strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>Issues to be addressed included rules relating to the mechanisms, a regime for assessing Parties compliance, accounting methods for national emissions and emissions reductions, and rules on crediting countries for carbon sinks.</p>
      <p>Issues under the UNFCCC requiring resolution included questions of capacity building, the development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and/or to actions taken by industrialized countries to combat climate change.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4">
      <h2>COP-6 PART I</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>COP-6 and the resumed SB-13 were held in The Hague, the Netherlands, from 13-25 November 2000.</p>
      <p>During the second week of negotiations, COP-6 President Jan Pronk (the Netherlands) attempted to facilitate negotiations on the many disputed political and technical issues by convening high-level informal Plenary sessions.</p>
      <p>After almost 36 hours of intense talks in the final two days of COP-6, negotiators could not agree on a range of topics, particularly financial issues, supplementarity in the use of the mechanisms, compliance, and LULUCF.</p>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk announced that delegates had failed to reach agreement.</p>
      <p>Delegates then agreed to suspend COP-6 and resume negotiations in 2001.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_5">
      <h2>COP-6 PART II</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the agreement reached in Kyoto, stating that it considered the Protocol to be 'fatally flawed,' as it would damage its economy and exempt key developing countries from emissions reduction targets.</p>
      <p>Parties reconvened at COP-6 Part II and SB-14 from 16-27 July 2001, in Bonn, Germany.</p>
      <p>After protracted consultations, President Pronk presented his proposal for a draft political decision.</p>
      <p>Despite support from several Parties, disagreements surfaced over the nature of the compliance regime.</p>
      <p>After several days of high-level consultations, ministers agreed to adopt President Pronks political decision, with a revised section on compliance on 25 July 2001.</p>
      <p>The political decision - or 'Bonn Agreements' - needed to be operationalized through COP decisions.</p>
      <p>These decisions were considered a 'package,' and since no agreement was reached on the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF, all draft decisions were forwarded to COP-7.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_6">
      <h2>COP-7</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Delegates continued discussions on the 'Bonn Agreements' at COP-7 and SB-15 in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October to 10 November 2001.</p>
      <p>After lengthy negotiations, a package deal on LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information), and input to the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) was proposed.</p>
      <p>Although the deal was accepted by most regional groups, some Annex I Parties, including Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the Russian Federation, did not join the consensus, disputing, among other things, eligibility requirements and credit banking under the mechanisms.</p>
      <p>However, following extensive negotiations, the 'Marrakesh Accords' were agreed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_7">
      <h2>SB-16</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Parties met at SB-16 in Bonn from 5-14 June 2002.</p>
      <p>Delegates considered several issues previously left off the agenda due to the pressing BAPA negotiations.</p>
      <p>Views on the direction of the climate process differed, with some Parties looking back to recent debates and others looking ahead toward the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>Many hoped the Protocol could enter into force by the WSSD in August 2002, with the EU and Japan announcing their Protocol ratifications prior to the Summit.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_8">
      <h2>COP-8</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Delegates to COP-8 and SB-17 met from 23 October to 1 November 2002, in New Delhi, India.</p>
      <p>On the final day of COP-8, they adopted the Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainable Development.</p>
      <p>The Declaration reaffirms development and poverty eradication as overriding priorities in developing counties, and recognizes Parties common but differentiated responsibilities and national development priorities and circumstances in the implementation of UNFCCC commitments.</p>
      <p>Parties at COP-8 considered institutional and procedural issues under the Protocol and adopted several decisions, including the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board of the CDM.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_9">
      <h2>SB-18</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Delegates to SB-18 met in Bonn from 4-13 June 2003, and continued to address issues under negotiation since COP-8 and prepare for the Protocols entry into force.</p>
      <p>Conclusions were agreed on a number of issues, but the issue of the Secretariats programme budget for 2004-5 and the Special Climate Change Fund proved to be particularly difficult.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_10">
      <h2>COP-9 REPORT</h2>
      <small>COP</small>
      <p>Opening the session on Monday morning, 1 December, COP-8 Vice-President Enele Sopoaga (Tuvalu) welcomed participants. On behalf of COP-8 President T.R.</p>
      <p>Baalu, Indias Joint Secretary for Environment and Forests C. Viswanath called on Annex I Parties to take the lead in addressing the impacts of climate change and to provide developing countries with financial and technological assistance.</p>
      <p>He rejected the introduction of commitments for developing countries. Vice-President Sopoaga then introduced Miklós Persányi, Minister of Environment and Water, Hungary, who was elected as COP-9 President by acclamation.</p>
      <p>In his opening statement, President Persányi highlighted efforts in developing countries to implement climate-friendly production patterns.</p>
      <p>He stressed that although the Protocol has not yet entered into force, its ratification by numerous Parties demonstrates its importance. Altero Matteoli, Italys Minister for the Environment and Territory, said COP-9 provided an opportunity to identify new and stronger initiatives for combating climate change.</p>
      <p>Roberto Formigoni, President of the Region of Lombardy, stressed the importance of regional action on climate change, while Gabriel Albertini, Mayor of Milan, said delegates must take long-term views of climate change, its impacts, and the well-being of future generations.</p>
      <p>Luigi Cocchiaro, for the President of the Province of Milan, called for increased implementation in the areas of transport and renewable energy. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter said that, while the date of the Protocols entry into force remained uncertain, it was encouraging that this had not slowed the momentum for action.</p>
      <p>She emphasized the need to ensure that adequate resources were provided to meet programme delivery and implementation of COP decisions. Morocco, speaking for the G-77/China, called on the Russian Federation to ratify the Protocol and on the US to 'come back on board,' and expressed concern about the low level of Parties contributions to the Secretariat.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe, on behalf of the Africa Group, said Annex I Parties have failed to assume leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lack political will to do so. Italy, speaking for the EU, urged the US to take actions comparable to those that would have been expected from them under the Protocol.</p>
      <p>Tuvalu, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), said the discussion on sinks in the CDM must maintain the social, environmental and economic integrity of the mechanism.</p>
      <p>Pakistan said work at COP-9 must focus on capacity building, technology transfer, and the Special Climate Change Fund. Highlighting the vulnerability of LDCs, Tanzania, for the LDCs, stressed the need for entry into force of the Protocol and constructive work on matters relating to technology transfer, capacity building and LDCs. The COP met in plenary sessions on Monday, 1 December, Thursday, 4 December and twice on Friday, 12 December.</p>
      <p>A high-level segment took place on Wednesday and Thursday, 10-11 December, and included three round-table discussions.</p>
      <p>The SBI and SBSTA opened on Monday, 1 December.</p>
      <p>The SBSTA met from Monday to Wednesday, 1-3 December, and closed on Tuesday, 9 December.</p>
      <p>The SBI met from Monday to Thursday, 1-4 December, Tuesday, 9 December, and closed on Wednesday, 10 December.</p>
      <p>Numerous contact group meetings and informal consultations were also held.</p>
      <p>This report summarizes the issues discussed at this meeting, organized in accordance with the agendas of the SBSTA, SBI and COP.</p>

      <h2>IPCC THIRD ASSESSMENT REPORT</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change, and scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation: On Monday, 1 December, Chair Thorgeirsson introduced his summary of the pre-sessional consultations, held from 27-28 November 2003, in Milan.</p>
      <p>Malaysia, speaking for the G-77/China, expressed hope that the new agenda items would not introduce new commitments for developing country Parties. The EU said SBSTA should use a wide range of approaches and methodologies, including case-studies, technical papers, and workshops, and should draw on activities being developed by stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Japan said the process should be based on a step-wise, practical approach. Delegates agreed to convene a contact group chaired by SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson on this issue. On Thursday, 4 December, contact group Chair Thorgeirsson introduced the draft decision and draft SBSTA conclusions on this issue.</p>
      <p>Noting the need to further discuss the themes and issues to be considered by SBSTA under the two new agenda items, the G-77/China objected to forwarding a draft decision to the COP.</p>
      <p>Opposing the G-77/China, several Parties emphasized the need to begin work on the new agenda items.</p>
      <p>Chair Thorgeirsson said he would consult informally with Parties. In the contact group meeting held on Friday, 5 December, Chair Thorgeirsson reported on informal consultations, noting that Parties highlighted the need to: build upon existing agreement; advance work without creating boundaries; encourage broad participation, including from experts, while keeping the process under Party control; and ensure participation by all Parties.</p>
      <p>Parties considered a future workshop, with Saudi Arabia urging work to focus on determining the terms of reference of the workshop.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China, New Zealand and Thailand stressed the need to determine the workshops scope.</p>
      <p>China, India, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia proposed structured submissions on priority themes for consideration at the workshop, while the EU and Norway said there was no need for further submissions.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China, Saudi Arabia and Oman objected to drafting a COP decision, while the EU, Norway, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and Canada expressed support for it. In the contact group on Saturday, 6 December, Chair Thorgeirsson introduced a revised draft COP decision and draft conclusions, and invited Parties to meet in informal consultations. Following agreement in the informal consultations, Parties met in the SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 9 December.</p>
      <p>The Russian Federation emphasized that the TAR provides a 'scientific basis of a global nature' applicable to all Parties.</p>
      <p>SBSTA adopted conclusions and agreed to forward a draft decision to the COP.</p>
      <p>The COP adopted the decision on Friday, 12 December.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_15">
      <h2>SBSTA Conclusions</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.26), SBSTA notes that exchanges with experts as held during the pre-sessional consultations may be useful for the future work of SBSTA under the new agenda items.</p>
      <p>SBSTA also notes that the themes of, inter alia, sustainable development, opportunities and solutions, and vulnerability and risk, are relevant for consideration under the two new agenda items.</p>
      <p>SBSTA invites Parties to submit their views on these themes, and other information relating to these agenda items. In the conclusions, SBSTA also: requests the Secretariat, under the guidance of the SBSTA Chair, to organize a workshop on each of the new agenda items during SBSTA-20; requests the SBSTA Chair to take into account the views and information provided by Parties when organizing the workshops; and agrees to determine next steps on each of the new agenda items at SBSTA-20 in light of the outcomes of the workshops.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_16">
      <h2>COP Decision</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In the decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.26/Add.1), the COP requests SBSTA-20 to initiate its work on scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change, and on scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation, and to focus on exchanging information and sharing experiences and view among Parties on practical opportunities and solutions to facilitate the UNFCCCs implementation.</p>
      <p>The COP also requests SBSTA to report on its work to COP-11.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_17">
      <h2>METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Review of methodological work under the UNFCCC and Protocol: In the SBSTA Plenary on Monday, 1 December, several Parties noted the value of the Secretariats synthesis of views on a future work programme on methodological work and stressed the need for a data interface.</p>
      <p>Chair Thorgeirsson requested Jim Penman (UK) and Brian Challenger (Antigua and Barbuda) to co-chair a contact group to discuss these issues. In the contact group on Tuesday, 2 December, Parties disagreed over the approach and content of the activities to be discussed, but agreed to rationalize the proposals, avoid the duplication of work, and move forward with the commencement of a scoping phase for a data interface. In the contact group meeting held on Thursday, 4 December, the Co-Chairs presented proposed elements for further discussion, distinguishing new items from those that are already being addressed under the UNFCCC or elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Several Parties recommended a focus on methodological work for UNFCCC implementation and good practices in policies and measures (P&amp;Ms) in Annex I Parties.</p>
      <p>Parties disagreed over the inclusion of text on cleaner or less-greenhouse gas-emitting energy, methodologies on the impact of implementation of the Protocol, and methodologies to determine Parties contributions. On Friday, 5 December, concerns were raised in the contact group regarding: cost implications; whether work on the agenda item had been completed; linking text on capacity building and collaborative efforts to the elements of methodological work; and text on periodic overviews. In the contact group on Monday, 8 December, some delegates expressed concern that provisions on background information and on future methodological work should await completion of IPCC TAR discussions.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to provisions on a data-interface scoping phase and to delete text on: periodic overviews of the status of methodological work; collaboration with relevant organizations; and capacity building relating to the development and dissemination of methodologies.</p>
      <p>Parties debated whether to remove provisions on the exchange of information regarding the implementation of national systems for the preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories, and on the exchange of information to increase common understanding of proposals for determining Parties contributions to controlling emissions. In the SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 9 December, delegates disagreed over whether a proposed workshop should focus solely on fourth national communications, on Annex I Parties projections, or whether it should be more general.</p>
      <p>Agreeing to focus a workshop on emissions projections of Annex I Parties as a contribution to their fourth national communications, SBSTA adopted the conclusions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_18">
      <h2>SBSTA Conclusions</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.25), SBSTA recognizes that the Secretariats Greenhouse Gas Information System is the authoritative repository of greenhouse gas data reported by Parties to the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>It requests the Secretariat, subject to the availability of funding, to: initiate a scoping phase for consideration of a data interface and invite Parties to submit views on this to be synthesized by the Secretariat; invite Parties submissions and organize a workshop on emissions projections of Annex I Parties, as a contribution to their fourth national communications; and invite Party submissions and organize a workshop on national systems under Protocol Article 5.1 for the preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_19">
      <h2>Greenhouse gas inventories</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In the SBSTA Plenary on Monday, 1 December, Parties called for the identification of options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from civil aviation.</p>
      <p>They also proposed that SBSTA work with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to achieve further progress, urged a more proactive role than information gathering on emissions from aviation and maritime transportation, and encouraged SBSTA to support programmes for improving maritime and aviation emissions estimates. Chair Thorgeirsson requested Helen Plume (New Zealand) to conduct informal consultations on the matter.</p>
      <p>In the SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 9 December, Plume said Parties had been unable to remove all of the brackets from the draft conclusions on emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transportation.</p>
      <p>Following discussions in Plenary, Parties agreed to remove the brackets.</p>
      <p>SBSTA adopted the conclusions, as amended.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_20">
      <h2>SBSTA Conclusions</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.28), SBSTA addresses methodological issues, emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transportation, and the report on national greenhouse gas inventory data from Annex I Parties for the period of 1990-2001.</p>
      <p>SBSTA requests the Secretariat to continue to cooperate with the IPCC and provide more detailed information, based on the latest available greenhouse gas inventories submitted by Parties, and the result of the technical review of the greenhouse gas inventories.</p>
      <p>SBSTA also notes the substantial improvement in quality and timing of greenhouse gas inventory submissions, by most Annex I Parties.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_21">
      <h2>Afforestation and Reforestation under the CDM</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>On Tuesday, 2 December, SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson noted progress on definitions and modalities on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) projects under the CDM during pre-sessional consultations undertaken Friday and Saturday, 29-30 November.</p>
      <p>He said delegates had addressed, inter alia: baselines, additionality and leakage; crediting options; and socioeconomic and environmental criteria.</p>
      <p>Chair Thorgeirsson said a contact group would be formed, co-chaired by Karsten Sach (Germany) and Thelma Krug (Brazil). In a meeting of the contact group held on Wednesday, 3 December, Co-Chair Sach presented a revised negotiating text, to be annexed to the draft COP decision.</p>
      <p>The text incorporated several submissions by Parties, particularly on permanence and on socioeconomic and environmental criteria.</p>
      <p>Other proposals tabled included provisions on invasive alien species (IAS), genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and small-scale projects. On Thursday, 5 December, delegates met in informal consultations and discussed the viability of positive leakage and the various options for establishing a crediting period. In the contact group on Saturday, 6 December, Co-Chair Krug presented a revised annex to the draft COP decision.</p>
      <p>Detailing the modalities and procedures of afforestation and reforestation project activities, the annex maintains agreed definitions of forest, afforestation and reforestation.</p>
      <p>It also includes an option for both temporary and long-term credits, which may be renewed or taken for a fixed crediting period; allows for negative leakage only; provides a definition for small-scale projects with modalities to be decided at COP-10; incorporates socioeconomic and environmental criteria into project design document requirements; and includes a general reference to the IPCC Good Practice Guidance. On Monday, 8 December, informal consultations continued throughout the day and into the night.</p>
      <p>Discussions centered, inter alia, on the size and modalities governing small-scale projects, and the inclusion of IAS and GMOs. On Tuesday, 9 December, Co-Chair Krug presented the contact group with a revised annex to the draft COP decision resulting from informal consultations held throughout Monday, 8 December, and into Tuesday morning, 9 December.</p>
      <p>Several Parties congratulated the Co-Chairs on the 'balanced package' and urged others to avoid re-opening the debate.</p>
      <p>Canada, opposed by Switzerland and the EU, proposed deleting reference in the draft COP decision on awareness of international 'environmental' agreements and leaving only 'international agreements.</p>
      <p>' The amendment was accepted in the spirit of compromise, and the contact group decided to forward the draft COP decision to SBSTA for approval. In the SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 9 December, contact group Co-Chair Krug reported that agreement had been reached on the draft COP decision.</p>
      <p>While Australia expressed concern regarding the singling out of GMOs and IAS, Norway regretted the lack of stronger language excluding them from project activities.</p>
      <p>The EU stressed that the text was balanced and reflected progress toward implementing the Protocol.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, 9 December, SBSTA agreed to forward the draft decision to the COP.</p>
      <p>On Friday, 12 December, the COP adopted the decision.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_22">
      <h2>COP Decision</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The decision on afforestation and reforestation under the CDM (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27) contains a draft COP/MOP decision and an annex detailing the modalities and procedures of the project activities decision.</p>
      <p>In the decision, the COP declares an awareness of relevant provisions in international agreements applying to afforestation and reforestation under the CDM, and recognizes that host Parties evaluate risks associated with GMOs and IAS according to their national laws.</p>
      <p>The COP also invites Parties submissions on simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale projects and their implementation, and requests the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper on the matter based on Parties submissions, to be considered by SBSTA-20 and COP-10.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_23">
      <h2>Good practice guidance and other information on LULUCF</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>SBSTA decided to address the IPCC report on good practice guidance for LULUCF, together with the IPCCs work on factoring out direct human-induced changes in carbon stocks from indirect human-induced and natural effects, as well as with the IPCC report on degradation of forests and devegetation of other vegetation types. On Tuesday, 2 December, the IPCC presented its report on Good Practice Guidance (GPG) for LULUCF to SBSTA.</p>
      <p>The IPCC also reported on its work on factoring out, and noted difficulties in providing a practical methodology for factoring out for a broad range of LULUCF activities.</p>
      <p>Chair Thorgeirsson said Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe) and Audun Rosland (Norway) would co-chair a contact group to develop conclusions on the GPG. On Wednesday, 3 December, during a meeting of the contact group, several Parties suggested adopting the IPCCs GPG.</p>
      <p>They noted the need to retain links in the common reporting format with the Revised 1996 IPCC Reporting Guidelines, and said that the sectoral tables should be simplified and consistent.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Rosland established a small group to continue informal discussions on this issue. The G-77/China and the EU highlighted the importance of factoring out, saying it reflected principles agreed in the Marrakesh Accords, and therefore needed to be addressed before the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>On degradation of forests and devegetation of other types, the contact group agreed that submissions by Parties should be requested for further discussion at COP-10. In the contact group on Thursday, 4 December, Co-Chair Rosland reported progress on the common reporting format and announced that the EU, with the help of Canada, would present reporting tables on sectoral background data for LULUCF based on IPCC GPG. On Friday, 5 December, the contact group discussed draft conclusions recommending the use of the IPCC GPG under the UNFCCC, while considering the GPG further at SBSTA-20, before recommending its use under the Protocol.</p>
      <p>AOSIS raised concerns over adopting the GPG without sufficient time for its examination, and also over the practicality of considering the GPG for the UNFCCC and Protocol separately.</p>
      <p>Others urged the adoption of the GPG for both the UNFCCC and the Protocol in order to prepare national inventories in time for entry into force of the Protocol.</p>
      <p>The EU recommended recording Tuvalus concerns in the meetings minutes instead of amending the draft conclusions.</p>
      <p>Tuvalu opposed this suggestion. On degradation of forests and devegetation of other vegetation types, Parties debated whether the SBSTA should invite Parties to submit their views on possible definitions and methodologies to the Secretariat. On Saturday, 6 December, the contact group continued discussions on the revised draft conclusions and a draft COP decision, centered on whether to recommend the GPG for reporting under the UNFCCC as well as under the Protocol.</p>
      <p>Delegates also discussed how to refer to the IPCC report on factoring out when taking note of it in the decisions, and accounting of LULUCF activities. In the contact group on Monday, 8 December, Co-Chair Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe announced that Parties had agreed to recommend the IPCC GPG for reporting under the UNFCCC, and to continue considering reporting requirements under the Protocol at SBSTA-20, with a view to making a decision by COP-10.</p>
      <p>On factoring out, Parties agreed to note the IPCC report submitted to SBSTA by the IPCC in response to a COP invitation. On Tuesday, 9 December, the SBSTA adopted draft conclusions and agreed to a decision to be forwarded to the COP, which adopted the decision on Friday, 12 December.</p>

      <p>Adoption of the agenda: On Monday, 1 December, Chair Stoycheva opened the session, and introduced the agenda for adoption (FCCC/SBI/2003/9 and Corr.1).</p>
      <p>Regarding the sub-item on submission of second and third national communications, the G-77/China objected to the reference to the 'frequency of' submissions and, with Saudi Arabia, stressed the importance of financial and technical support for preparing national communications before addressing the issue of their timing.</p>
      <p>Supporting the inclusion of this reference, the EU, with Australia, noted that decision 17/CP.8 (guidelines for the preparation on non-Annex I national communications) refers to the 'frequency of' submissions. On the sub-item dealing with the consideration of the fifth compilation and synthesis of initial national communications, the G-77/China, opposed by the US, objected to a document tabled by the Secretariat on steps taken by non-Annex I Parties to reduce emissions. On the agenda item addressing the implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse affects), the EU and US emphasized the need to discuss the implementation of decision 5/CP.7 (implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 on adverse effects) as a sub-item.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China and others proposed that the agenda sub-item not be restricted to decision 5/CP.7, but address all matters related to Article 4.8.</p>
      <p>Following discussion, the agenda was adopted with these two sub-items held in abeyance. On Thursday, 4 December, Chair Stoycheva noted that, following informal consultations, Parties had reached agreement on the two agenda sub-items.</p>

On Thursday, 4 December, SBI addressed the issue of submission of second, and where appropriate, third national communications.</p>
      <p>The US suggested that non-Annex I national communications should be submitted no more than four years after the submission of their initial communications, and that LDCs should submit their communications every five years.</p>
      <p>Regarding the submission of greenhouse gas inventories, she proposed that non-Annex I Parties should submit these every two years, and that LDCs should submit inventories every five years, as part of their national communications. In the contact group on Friday, 5 December, Parties addressed the fifth compilation and synthesis report and work of the CGE.</p>
      <p>Parties addressed how CGE workshops should be organized, with the EU, opposed by the G-77/China, suggesting that workshops could address all thematic areas in a combined approach, rather than addressing one theme only. On Saturday, 6 December, the contact group considered provision of financial and technical support, and the timing of submissions of second and, where appropriate, third national communications.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China noted that the preparation of national communications is a continuous process, but that the frequency of submissions is a 'non-issue.</p>
      <p>' Chair Appadu requested submissions from Parties on their views, for inclusion in the draft conclusions and COP decision. In the contact group on Monday, 8 December, the G-77/China suggested deleting text recognizing that the submission of national communications would ensure that the COP has sufficient information to assess the UNFCCCs implementation in a timely manner.</p>
      <p>The EU proposed text that national communications assist the COP to review the UNFCCCs implementation. On Tuesday, 9 December, delegates met twice in the contact group.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China suggested text stating that frequency of submissions of national communications shall be dependent on the availability of funding.</p>
      <p>The EU, US and Australia favored text requiring that second national communications be submitted within three years of the availability of financial resources.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China underlined that it would not discuss the issue of frequency of submissions.</p>

      <p>Delegates could not agree to a Canadian proposal to use non-Annex I national communications as the basis for defining adaptation and technology transfer priorities. In the contact group on Wednesday, 10 December, Co-Chair Moore presented a second revision of the Co-Chairs draft COP decision, noting that it was a 'take it or leave it' text.</p>
      <p>The EU, Canada and Japan, opposed by the G-77/China, said they could accept the Co-Chairs text.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China proposed alternative text regarding the prioritization of, and funding for, economic diversification activities.</p>
      <p>Following further informal consultations, Co-Chair Moore said the draft COP decision would be forwarded to SBI with bracketed text.</p>
      <p>In the SBI Plenary on Wednesday, 10 December, SBI agreed to forward the draft decision to the COP President for further action.</p>

      <h2>REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMITMENTS AND OF OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE UNFCCC</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>On Thursday, 4 December, delegates presented their views on this item, with the Russian Federation, Belarus and Slovenia reporting that the decline in emissions in their countries is due to the decoupling of GDP and emissions, and not due to economic decline.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China expressed concern over the increase in Annex I emissions and appealed for political commitment.</p>
      <p>Argentina, opposed by the US, questioned the appropriateness of the emissions intensity measurement.</p>
      <p>AOSIS, with Bangladesh, said that failure to mitigate emissions has resulted in the need to increase adaptation measures.</p>
      <p>Iceland called for the application and transfer of existing technologies, and South Africa called for demonstrable leadership by Annex I Parties.</p>
      <p>President Persányi said José Ovalle (Chile) and Michael Zammit-Cutajar (Malta) would co-chair a contact group on this issue. On Friday, 5 December, the contact group discussed a draft COP decision.</p>
      <p>Argentina noted omissions regarding the extent of delay in submission of documents, problems in the implementation of P&amp;Ms, and increasing emissions levels.</p>
      <p>The US said references to commitments under the Protocol may be premature, questioned the interpretation of Article 4.2 (a) and (b) (fulfillment of commitments by developed country Parties) and objected to the focus on international aviation.</p>
      <p>Opposed by the EU, the G-77/China suggested removing reference to Article 4.2 throughout the draft decision, noting that such reference was judgmental. In the COP Plenary on Friday, 12 December, Co-Chair Ovalle reported on the work of the contact group, and the COP adopted the decision.</p>
      <p>Argentina stressed that future discussions on this matter should include the need to have comparable methodologies for measuring greenhouse gas emission projections, and Saudi Arabia said the impacts of Annex I P&amp;Ms on developing countries dependent on fossil fuel exports also need to be addressed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_81">
      <h2>COP Decision</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In the decision (FCCC/2003/CP/L.3), the COP notes that: aggregate greenhouse gas emissions of Annex I Parties in 2000 were below their 1990 levels largely because of decreases in EIT emissions; emissions in energy and transport sectors had increased in 2000 above 1990 levels; and emissions from international civil aviation had increased more than 40% in the period 1990-2000.</p>
      <p>The COP concludes that further action is needed by Annex I Parties to implement P&amp;Ms that will contribute to modifying longer-term trends in anthropogenic emissions and urges these Parties to intensify their efforts in this regard.</p>
      <p>The COP urges those Annex I Parties that have not submitted their national communications or their annual greenhouse gas inventories to do so as a matter of priority. In addition, the COP stresses the need for Parties included in Annex II to the UNFCCC to provide detailed information on their assistance to developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects.</p>
      <p>It encourages SBSTA to consider ways of improving the transparency of greenhouse gas projections in time to contribute to the preparation of fourth national communications.</p>

      <h2>CLOSING PLENARY</h2>
      <small>plenary</small>
      <p>Rapporteur Gonzalo Menéndez (Panama) introduced the report of COP-9 on Friday, 12 December, which the COP adopted (FCCC/CP/2003/L.1 and Add.1). Cuba requested that its concerns over being denied visas to attend the GEF Council meetings, despite being the Caribbean countriesrepresentative on the Council, be noted in the COP-9 report.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China read a statement urging the GEF Secretariat to take the necessary action with the World Bank and host government to grant the representative of the Caribbean constituency a visa to attend the GEF Council meetings.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China also urged the GEF Secretariat and other international organizations to take the necessary action and make arrangement with host governments and relevant agencies to guarantee the representation of all Parties at relevant meetings.</p>
      <p>President Persányi said the request would be noted in the COP-9 Report. The Russian Federation questioned when preparatory work to facilitate the implementation of projects under Protocol Article 6 (joint implementation) would be undertaken.</p>
      <p>The Executive Secretary responded that this would be done by the Secretariat in 2004-5, subject to the availability of resources from extra-budgetary resources which will be activated in 2005 upon entry into force of the Protocol. Argentina introduced an expression of gratitude to the Government of Italy and the people of the city of Milan, which the COP adopted (FCCC/CP/2003/L.6).

    <div id="section_93">
      <h2>A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF COP-9 THE TWO FACES OF THE UNFCCC</h2>
      <small>ANALYSIS</small>
      <p>Two sides of the UNFCCC, two 'faces,' were clearly visible at COP-9.</p>
      <p>The first face was that of the ongoing negotiations aimed at strengthening and building on the original treaty and bringing the Kyoto Protocol to fruition.</p>
      <p>While these official negotiations enjoyed some progress at COP-9, including an agreement on the use of sinks in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), this side of the meeting could hardly be seen as an overwhelming success.</p>
      <p>While the official intergovernmental negotiations seemed beset by inertia and a lack of leadership, the COP-9 corridors were buzzing with what some saw as the second 'face' of the meeting; the 'implementing face.</p>
      <p>' This side of COP-9 was reflected in the workshops and other side events that showed the vision and enthusiasm being demonstrated for the Convention by its observer constituencies: environmental NGOs, business and industry groups, local governments, indigenous peoples organizations, and research and independent NGOs (RINGOs).</p>
      <p>It is these constituencies who continue to prove that, regardless of some Parties apparent reluctance to make significant progress, vigorous efforts to address the adverse effects of climate change are already underway, and are gaining momentum.</p>
      <p>This analysis provides an insight into these two different 'faces' of the UNFCCC process.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_94">
      <h2>THE 'FOREST COP'</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>While COP-8 is already referred to be some as the 'adaptation COP' due to the progress made on adaptation issues, for similar reasons negotiators may one day reminisce that COP-9 was the 'forest COP.</p>
      <p>' Ever since COP-4 in 1998, the issue of sinks in the CDM has been plagued by complex and time-consuming discussions and often diametrically opposed negotiating positions.</p>
      <p>The long period of sessional and inter-sessional consultations, which forged good relationships among negotiators and allowed Parties to understand each other's concerns, was the basis for a much more cordial atmosphere at COP-9. Essentially, the debate could be viewed as one between buyers and sellers of carbon sequestration credits.</p>
      <p>The buyers, including the EU, Norway and Switzerland, were mostly concerned about the quality of the product and sought conditions that would protect their investments and maintain credibility with environmental NGOs.</p>
      <p>Some insisted on rigorous criteria for socioeconomic and environmental impacts, non-permanence and leakage.</p>
      <p>The sellers, including Bolivia, Colombia, and other Latin American countries, on the other hand, strove for favorable market conditions, aimed at avoiding 'crippling' transaction costs.</p>
      <p>They sought more flexible crediting periods, an insurance approach to credits that would add value to what otherwise appears as a mere 'rent' of emissions reductions, and environmental and social impact assessments that are not excessively strict and costly. After years of negotiations, a compromise package was agreed, which in the words of one observer was 'masterfully crafted' by Co-Chairs Thelma Krug and Karsten Sach.</p>
      <p>While the value of the compromise still needs to be tested, for now, all Parties agree that the only way forward is learning by doing.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_95">
      <h2>The negotiations direction: backward, sideways or forward?</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Irrespective of the results achieved in the discussions on sinks in the CDM, there was undoubtedly a sense of treading the same waters, if not of pedaling backwards on a range of other issues considered by the SBSTA and SBI.</p>
      <p>These included negotiations on the IPCCs Third Assessment Report (TAR) and on non-Annex I national communications. The limited progress in the TAR negotiations becomes evident as soon as one recalls that it was the First Assessment Report (FAR) that led to the negotiation of the UNFCCC itself, while the Second Assessment Report (SAR) helped trigger negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>In contrast, nearly three years after the TARs completion, and following two years of negotiations in SBSTA and COP sessions, delegates only just agreed not to preclude substantive discussion of the TAR under the new agenda items on adaptation and mitigation established to this end.</p>
      <p>The G-77/Chinas strong resistance to adopting a COP decision on the TAR, and in fact to discussing anything beyond procedures for further consideration of this issue, is a clear reflection of the groups determination not to allow negotiations to head anywhere close to the issue of developing countries future commitments.</p>
      <p>After all, the new mitigation agenda item will be the main place where this could be addressed.</p>
      <p>With frustration over Annex I Parties failures to fulfill their commitments, limited transfer of technologies and insufficient financial support, developing countries held firmly to preventing negotiations turning towards mitigation activities by non-Annex I countries in the future. On the other hand, some observers commented with surprise on the G-77/Chinas prohibitive stance to advancing substantive consideration of the IPCC TAR, as this not only limits work on mitigation, but also on adaptation, a major concern to a large, although not necessarily very powerful, faction of the G-77/China group.</p>
      <p>Given this shortfall on focusing on substantive discussions, it is unlikely that the TAR will, unlike the SAR and FAR, significantly shape future UNFCCC negotiations.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the window of opportunity for considering the substance of the third, and possibly future, IPCC assessment reports has been created. On non-Annex I national communications, it would be a stretch to say that great advances have been made.</p>
      <p>In fact, the general perception seemed to be that Parties had taken a step back in at least one sense: whereas at SBSTA-18, delegates agreed to 'urge' Parties that have not yet done so to submit their national communications as soon as possible, this time around, the compromise language ended-up only 'encouraging' Parties to do so as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, lengthy negotiations at COP-8 on revised guidelines for preparing national communications returned to haunt negotiators as developing countries sought to weaken any additional commitments on reporting due to a realization that funding would be insufficient to cover this work. This, and the G-77/Chinas unwavering opposition to refer to the frequency of submissions, was seen by some as yet another illustration of developing countries unwillingness to move ahead on anything other than the obligations of the developed countries.</p>
      <p>As for Parties inability to reach agreement on the submission of future national communications, this is on the one hand a reflection of what some saw as the G-77/Chinas current 'mantra' to avoid indications of future commitments on their part.</p>
      <p>One the other hand, it illustrates the incoherence between the EUs negotiating mandate, pushing for a decision on this issue, and its determination to carry this through.</p>
      <p>Despite many EU Member States emphasis on the importance of this issue, it remained unclear to observers, save for incredulous miscommunication or a hidden agenda, why this issue was given up by the EU without any resistance. On the other hand, outside the box of defensive party positions and regime-focused strategic approaches held in the negotiations, the high-level round-table discussions among ministers provided a refreshing change of pace, allowing an opportunity to step back and take a wider perspective on the UNFCCC process and the issue of climate change itself.</p>
      <p>Unleashed from common denominator group positions and the confines of negotiations, ministers were forced, within strict time limits, to get to the point and present the issues, which they believe are most pertinent in the broader context of climate change.</p>
      <p>While many of the issues raised by ministers, such as sustainable development, adaptation and technology transfer are not new, they clearly needed political reinforcement.</p>
      <p>Statements by several countries on their Kyoto targets and future actions may also provide a better insight into the non-negotiated COP outcomes: ministers and senior officials from Canada, the Netherlands and Australia confirmed their intent to meet their Kyoto targets, even if the Protocol does not enter into force, and Germany, the UK, Philippines and Micronesia supported action on keeping the temperature increase below two degrees Celsius within this century.</p>
      <p>Re-awakening ministers to the needs to engage, mainstream and prioritize these broader issues may be one of the more significant, non-negotiated outcomes of the COP.</p>

      <h2>THE CONSTITUENCY FACE</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>While the official negotiations were taking place, the UNFCCCs 'second face' was also highly visible at COP-9.</p>
      <p>The Milan COP demonstrated that climate change issues remain high on the political agendas of many NGOs, business groups and the academic community, regardless of what is taking place in the latest round of intergovernmental negotiations.</p>
      <p>While diplomats were often left agreeing on the lowest common denominator, more than one hundred side events also took place Milan, almost all of which were focused on the highest common denominator: achieving the concrete and necessary steps to meet the UNFCCCs ultimate objective.</p>
      <p>To many attending COP-9, the attention and interest generated in these debates overshadowed the impasse and unwillingness of some Parties to engage in substantive negotiations on progress or lack thereof.</p>
      <p>The side events often stressed the various paths on which negotiators seemed 'afraid to travel,' - again highlighting the somewhat contradictory nature of the two faces of the UNFCCC most visible at COP-9. First, a large majority of side events focused on 'future actions' and 'post first commitment period thinking.</p>
      <p>' This contrasted sharply with the official negotiations, where the issue of the second review of the adequacy of commitment was held in abeyance for the fifth COP running.</p>
      <p>The last day of COP-9 saw an informal discussion between environmental NGOs and some Annex I and non-Annex I Parties to discuss the urgency of defining future actions. Secondly, while negotiations on national communications were continuously 'blocked' over concerns that the submission of information on inventories and P&amp;Ms will lead to 'new obligations,' the constituencies active in the side events have already built and solidified the foundations for the successful sharing of experiences, capacity and lessons learned, clearly demonstrating the value and contribution of such information in shaping debates on mainstreaming climate change, adaptation, local action and innovative projects.</p>
      <p>COP-9 also saw the official recognition of the RINGOs constituency, first created in COP-8, who took its place alongside other recognized observer constituencies.</p>
      <p>RINGOs form an important new constituency of organizations engaged in independent research and analysis, and their inclusion as a key constituency will inevitably strengthen the research elements of the climate process.</p>

      <h2>THE ONLY SHOW IN TOWN</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>While COP-9 had a rocky start, it ended on a positive note.</p>
      <p>Calling the Protocol 'an unrealistic and ever-increasing regulatory straitjacket,' US Under-Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky had written in a major financial newspaper that the 'only acceptable, cost-effective option' to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was the American way.</p>
      <p>This viewpoint was argued vigorously (albeit unconvincingly, according to most observers), by the 60-strong US delegation in Milan.</p>
      <p>Days later, an advisor in the Russian presidency, 'thought out loud' that Russian ratification was unlikely.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, these statements did not detract Parties from keeping the process on track.</p>
      <p>In fact, the overwhelming message from the high-level segment was that the Protocol is the 'only show in town.</p>
      <p>' COP-9 not only highlighted the division between developed and developing countries, but also the leadership and initiative gaps between negotiators and constituency groups.</p>
      <p>While resolving differences on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis remains complex, the significant number of side events signals a change towards a more positive outlook for future COP sessions.</p>
      <p>In that sense the major outcome of COP-9 is a renewed emphasis on the role of the UNFCCCs constituencies as an important component of the process to deliver an equitable global climate change regime, a point clearly made by their demands for strong climate action, dedicated leadership, information sharing and future thinking.</p>
