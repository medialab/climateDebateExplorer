      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small>HISTORY</small>
      <p>The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p>
      <p>The Convention, which entered into force on 21 March 1994, now has 195 parties.</p>
      <p>In December 1997, delegates to COP 3 in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy (EITs) to achieve emission reduction targets.</p>
      <p>These countries, known as Annex I parties under the UNFCCC, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and now has 192 parties.</p>

      <h2>LONG-TERM NEGOTIATIONS IN 2005-2009:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Convening in Montreal, Canada, at the end of 2005, the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties (CMP) decided to establish the AWG-KP under Protocol Article 3.9, which mandates consideration of Annex I parties further commitments at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period.</p>
      <p>COP 11 created a process to consider long-term cooperation under the Convention through a series of four workshops known as the Convention Dialogue.</p>
      <p>In December 2007, COP 13 and CMP 3 in Bali, Indonesia, resulted in agreement on the Bali Roadmap on long-term issues.</p>
      <p>COP 13 adopted the Bali Action Plan and established the AWG-LCA with a mandate to focus on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and a shared vision for long-term cooperative action.</p>
      <p>Negotiations on Annex I parties further commitments continued under the AWG-KP.</p>
      <p>The deadline for concluding the two-track negotiations was Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
      <p>In preparation, both AWGs held several negotiating sessions in 2008-2009.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>COPENHAGEN:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, took place in December 2009.</p>
      <p>The high-profile event was marked by disputes over transparency and process.</p>
      <p>During the high-level segment, informal negotiations took place in a group consisting of major economies and representatives of regional and other negotiating groups.</p>
      <p>Late in the evening of 18 December, these talks resulted in a political agreement: the Copenhagen Accord, which was then presented to the COP plenary for adoption.</p>
      <p>Over the next 13 hours, delegates debated the Accord.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the COP agreed to take note of the Copenhagen Accord.</p>
      <p>In 2010 over 140 countries indicated support for the Accord.</p>
      <p>More than 80 countries also provided information on their national mitigation targets or actions.</p>
      <p>Parties also agreed to extend the mandates of the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP until COP 16 and CMP 6 in 2010.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4">
      <h2>CANCUN:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Following four preparatory meetings in 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico, took place in December 2010.</p>
      <p>By the end of the conference, parties had finalized the Cancun Agreements, which include decisions under both negotiating tracks.</p>
      <p>Under the Convention track, Decision 1/CP.16 recognized the need for deep cuts in global emissions in order to limit global average temperature rise to 2°C.</p>
      <p>Parties also agreed to keep the global long-term goal under regular review and consider strengthening it during a review by 2015, including in relation to a proposed 1.5°C target.</p>
      <p>They took note of emission reduction targets and nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) communicated by developed and developing countries, respectively (FCCC/SB/2011/INF.1/Rev.1 and FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/INF.1, both issued after Cancun).</p>
      <p>Decision 1/CP.16 also addressed other aspects of mitigation, such as measuring, reporting and verification (MRV); reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+).</p>
      <p>The Cancun Agreements also established several new institutions and processes, such as the Cancun Adaptation Framework and the Adaptation Committee, as well as the Technology Mechanism, which includes the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) and the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN).</p>
      <p>They also created the Green Climate Fund (GCF), designated to be a new operating entity of the Convention s financial mechanism and governed by a Board of 24 members.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to set up a Transitional Committee tasked with the Fund s detailed design.</p>
      <p>Parties also established a Standing Committee to assist the COP with respect to the financial mechanism.</p>
      <p>They also recognized the commitment by developed countries to provide US$30 billion of fast-start finance in 2010-2012, and to jointly mobilize US$100 billion per year by 2020.</p>
      <p>Under the Protocol track, the CMP urged Annex I parties to raise the level of ambition of their emission reduction targets with a view to achieving aggregate emission reductions consistent with the range identified in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>
      <p>Parties also adopted Decision 2/CMP.6 on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).</p>
      <p>The mandates of the two AWGs were extended to the UN Climate Change Conference in Durban.</p>

      <h2>DURBAN:</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Following three negotiating sessions in 2011, the UN Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, took place from 28 November to 11 December 2011.</p>
      <p>The Durban outcomes cover a wide range of topics, notably the establishment of a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, a decision on long-term cooperative action under the Convention, and agreement on the operationalization of the GCF.</p>
      <p>After extensive negotiations, parties also reached agreement to launch the new ADP with a mandate to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties.</p>
      <p>The new negotiating process is scheduled to end by 2015.</p>
      <p>The outcome is mandated for adoption at COP 21 and should come into effect and be implemented from 2020 onwards.</p>

      <h2>REPORT OF THE MEETING</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>The UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn opened on Monday morning, 14 May 2012.</p>
      <p>This report summarizes the discussions of the five bodies, based on their respective agendas: - First session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP); - 17th session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP ); - 15th session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA). - 36th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA); and - 36th session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI).</p>

    <div id="section_7">
      <h2>AD HOC WORKING GROUP ON THE DURBAN PLATFORM FOR ENHANCED ACTION</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>Opening the first session of the ADP, COP 17 President Maite Nkoana-Mashabane (South Africa) identified the new body as an opportunity to consider what needs to be done beyond 2020.</p>
      <p>She urged parties to engage constructively and create a credible work plan, prioritizing work in such a manner that the ADP can finalize its work by 2015.</p>
      <p>Highlighting the ADP as an opportunity to demonstrate that multilateralism works, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres indicated that the ADP s work should be guided by both a short-term view that considers implementation and a long-term perspective that rises to the challenge of the post-2020 world.</p>
      <p>Algeria, for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), stated that the ADP s outcome must be in line with the objective, principles and provisions of the Convention and emphasized the importance of progress under the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>She said the ADP s work plan must be based on Decision 1/CP.17 (Establishment of an Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action), equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and the relevant provisions of the Convention.</p>
      <p>Switzerland, for the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG), highlighted the ADP as a turning point in the UNFCCC negotiations.</p>
      <p>He identified mitigation as the core task, involving all countries in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, while also addressing adaption, finance, technology and capacity-building.</p>
      <p>The EIG called for a solid work plan, agreed in Bonn, that includes milestones and a timetable, leading to a smooth adoption of the future regime in 2015.</p>
      <p>The European Union (EU) emphasized that their decision to participate in a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol was taken in the context of the wider package in Durban that leads to transition toward a single global agreement.</p>
      <p>He said a new protocol would be the most effective form of such an agreement, and identified the need to discuss how the new protocol can allow sustainable development as well as delivering the necessary emission reductions by all parties.</p>
      <p>On the mitigation work plan, the EU identified the process of closing the mitigation gap as an iterative one whereby the gap is assessed, options to increase ambition are identified and the appropriate decisions are taken.</p>
      <p>Australia, for the Umbrella Group, underscored the Durban Platform as a universal platform to take international efforts on climate change forward by providing a common ground for all countries.</p>
      <p>He suggested focusing the work in Bonn on defining the ADP s work plan and added that the establishment of low-carbon development pathways is key to addressing climate change without sacrificing economic growth or development.</p>
      <p>The Gambia, for Least Developed Countries (LDCs), highlighted that the ADP s mandate provides an opportunity to enhance the mitigation ambition and adopt a new protocol under the Convention applicable to all, taking into consideration equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.</p>
      <p>He suggested identifying deliverables for each COP in the context of a three-year programme that would allow incorporating inputs from, inter alia , the IPCC s Fifth Assessment Report.</p>
      <p>He underscored that the work of the ADP must not be seen as an opportunity to postpone action, and stressed the importance of the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>Nauru, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), expressed hope that the ADP would demonstrate a sober, serious and determined sense of urgency and ambition.</p>
      <p>She called for a mitigation work plan that makes strides in closing the recognized mitigation ambition gap.</p>
      <p>Swaziland, for the African Group, said the ADP should result in a strengthened multilateral, rule-based climate change regime, emphasizing the need for significant scaling up of developed country mitigation ambition.</p>
      <p>Egypt, for the Arab Group, stressed that negotiations under the ADP must ensure full and effective implementation of the Convention.</p>
      <p>He also emphasized the need to respect, and not renegotiate, the principles that govern international action.</p>
      <p>Papua New Guinea, for the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, stated that an international legal instrument is needed now as 2020 is too late.</p>
      <p>She underscored the important role of REDD+ in the new regime.</p>
      <p>India, for Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC), said that the full elaboration of the ADP s work plan will only be possible after the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP have concluded their work and that an outcome should reflect the historical responsibility of developed countries and view the Durban Platform as a historic opportunity to ensure that international climate regime evolves according to the realities of a changing world.</p>
      <p>Tajikistan, for Mountainous Landlocked Developing Countries, said a new legally-binding agreement must build upon the Convention s principles and suggested that a contact group be formed to get work underway.</p>
      <p>Chile, for Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Peru, Panama and Dominica, said the results of the ADP should take the form of a protocol or some other legally-binding instrument under the Convention.</p>
      <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo, for the Central Africa Forests Commission (COMIFAC), said the working group should lead to the adoption of a new binding accord and that the ADP should treat adaptation and mitigation on equal footing.</p>
      <p>Honduras, for the Central American Integration System (SICA), said: adaptation is the priority for the majority of developing countries, in particular for the most vulnerable ones.</p>
      <p>Argentina, for a number of countries, emphasized that an ADP outcome should be in accordance with the Convention s principles, recognizing the different nature of developing and developed countries obligations.</p>
      <p>He added that developing countries voluntary NAMAs are related to the provision of finance, technology and capacity building, and suggested that the ADP s work plan first focus on the scope of the work, including on guiding principles.</p>
      <p>Business and Industry NGOs suggested strengthening the avenues for the business and private sector to contribute to the ADP s work in areas such as finance, innovation, MRV, and new market mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Climate Action Network (CAN), for Environmental NGOs, urged: increasing mitigation ambition through, inter alia , closing loopholes, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and adopting an ADP work plan with milestones. ICLEI, for Local Government and Municipal Authorities, underscored that there is a dangerous gap between now and 2020 that needs to be addressed by increasing mitigation ambition.</p>
      <p>He highlighted the key role of local governments in successfully implementing climate change policies.</p>
      <p>Women and Gender Constituency cautioned against exacerbating gender inequalities and identified the need to integrate human and social dimensions into the climate change negotiations.</p>
      <p>She suggested a workshop on gender equality.</p>
      <p>Youth NGOs (YOUNGOs) said: the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is not negotiable; the integrity of the Convention should not be undermined; and closing the ambition gap should be a priority for the ADP.</p>

      <h2>ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Discussions during ADP 1 focused on the election of officers and the agenda.</p>
      <p>Agreement on these two issues took time and was only reached during the ADP closing plenary on 25 May.</p>
      <p>Election of Officers: In the ADP plenary on Thursday, 17 May, COP Vice-President Robert Van Lierop (Suriname) explained that intensive consultations have taken place before and during the Bonn meeting concerning the ADP Bureau.</p>
      <p>He noted that it remains unresolved and urged parties to agree on nominees for the Chair and Vice-Chair so that the ADP can begin its work.</p>
      <p>The three candidates for ADP Chair were Harald Dovland (Norway), nominated by the Western Europe and Others Group, Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago), nominated by the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC) and Jayant Moreshwar Mauskar (India), nominated by the Asia-Pacific Group.</p>
      <p>A proposal was made to elect the Chair at this session and continue consultations on the election of other officers until Doha.</p>
      <p>Delegates were given until Friday, 18 May to consult on this proposal.</p>
      <p>On 18 May, the ADP reconvened.</p>
      <p>COP Vice-President Van Lierop explained that consultations on the election of the ADP Bureau by Amb.</p>
      <p>Nozipho Joyce Mxakato-Diseko (South Africa) had been inconclusive.</p>
      <p>Diseko raised the possibility of the ADP Bureau being elected by a vote in accordance with the draft rules of procedure.</p>
      <p>Expressing regret for the situation, The Gambia, for LDCs, supported by Guyana, for GRULAC, the EU, the US, Australia, AOSIS and the Russian Federation, proposed that the COP Presidency preside over the ADP until matters concerning the election of its Bureau are resolved.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed that the COP President would preside during the Bonn session, while consultations continued on the election of officers.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, 19 May, COP Vice-President Van Lierop informed the ADP plenary that the COP 17 President had designated Sandea de Wet (South Africa) to preside over the ADP on her behalf and urged parties to intensify their efforts in informal consultations facilitated by Amb.</p>
      <p>Diseko so that the ADP Bureau can be elected by the end of the Bonn session.</p>
      <p>Informal consultations on the ADP Bureau continued throughout the meeting.</p>
      <p>On the morning of Friday, 25 May, Amb.</p>
      <p>Diseko reported that the consultations had been intensive and that they revealed parties strong interest and commitment to the work of the ADP.</p>
      <p>She explained there was agreement on the principles of equitable and geographical balance, rotation between Annex I and non-Annex I parties and regional rotation in 2012-2015.</p>
      <p>She noted that despite all efforts there was no successful outcome and described this as a sad state of affairs.</p>
      <p>She requested parties to prepare for elections in accordance with the draft rules of procedure.</p>
      <p>The EU, supported by Saudi Arabia, requested an adjournment to allow for further consultations among the regional groups.</p>
      <p>The ADP plenary was suspended for further informal consultations.</p>
      <p>In the evening, Amb.</p>
      <p>Diseko reported that agreement had been reached.</p>
      <p>She outlined an interim arrangement, which will be applied pending its endorsement by COP 18.</p>
      <p>The arrangement consists of a multi-year approach for the Bureau, with two Co-Chairs, one from a non-Annex I country and one from an Annex I country.</p>
      <p>In 2012-2013, the ADP will be co-chaired by Mauskar and Dovland.</p>
      <p>Oleg Shamanov (Russian Federation) will be the Rapporteur.</p>
      <p>In 2013, Kumarsingh will co-chair the ADP with a Co-Chair from an Annex I country, and the Rapporteur will come from a non-Annex I party.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the non-Annex I party Co-Chair will be from the African Group and the Rapporteur from a non-Annex I country.</p>
      <p>Diseko commended the ADP s achievement, underscoring the need for the spirit of unity and called for keeping transparency and mutual trust among parties. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres welcomed the new Bureau members and commended de Wet and the COP presidency for having unequivocal perseverance in taking forward the negotiations on the agenda and the Bureau officers.</p>
      <p>She highlighted the need to keep working in a spirit of mutual respect and congratulated parties for having taken the first of many footsteps of this journey. ADP Co-Chair Mauskar highlighted that the Durban package of decisions is a landmark and, in that context, the ADP is significant, in establishing a new process.</p>
      <p>He acknowledged that taking the process forward to achieve meaningful results at Doha and beyond will be complex and challenging.</p>
      <p>He said that the ADP Co-Chairs will undertake intersessional consultations on how parties intend to progress on the two work streams under the ADP agenda.</p>
      <p>Agenda and organization of work: The ADP agenda was first considered on Saturday, 19 May when interim Chair de Wet proposed that the ADP plenary adopts the agenda (FCCC/ADP/2012/1).</p>
      <p>China requested the Secretariat to explain the rationale of the items on the ADP s provisional agenda.</p>
      <p>The Secretariat responded that items 3 (planning of work in accordance with Decision 1/CP.17) and 4 (work plan on enhancing mitigation ambition) were placed on the provisional agenda on the basis of Decision 1/CP.17.</p>
      <p>China stated that Decision 1/CP.17 does not specify that the work plan on enhancing mitigation ambition should be under the ADP.</p>
      <p>He emphasized a post-2020 outlook as the ADP s core task, and also noted that raising the level of ambition does not only refer to mitigation but also to means of implementation in technology, finance and capacity building.</p>
      <p>China suggested deleting item 4 and amending item 3 to planning of the work on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity building.</p>
      <p>Singapore cautioned against listing specific issues to avoid potential exclusion of those not listed.</p>
      <p>He suggested that item 3 be adopted as proposed, while item 4 on the work plan on mitigation ambition be amended by adding in accordance with Decision 1/CP.17.</p>
      <p>Nauru, for AOSIS, The Gambia, for LDCs, Barbados, Grenada, Switzerland, the EU, the US, Mexico, Singapore, Australia, Japan and Costa Rica urged the adoption of the agenda as originally proposed.</p>
      <p>The EU stressed that the work plan on enhancing mitigation ambition was a core element of the Durban package.</p>
      <p>Barbados explained that a draft decision had been proposed in Durban that included only a post-2020 outlook but the most vulnerable countries had rejected this proposal.</p>
      <p>He suggested modifying item 4 by adding a reference to pre-2020 mitigation ambition.</p>
      <p>Many parties emphasized the need to adopt the agenda and begin substantive work as soon as possible, including on pre-2020 mitigation ambition.</p>
      <p>Brazil recognized that the work plan on enhancing mitigation ambition is part of the agreement on the ADP, highlighting that discussions around this issue will be broader than a simple reference to mitigation.</p>
      <p>He stressed that the main focus of the ADP s work will be on negotiations for the new instrument and that the two elements of its work will be separate.</p>
      <p>The Philippines, supported by several parties, proposed deleting item 4 and amending item 3 to planning of work in accordance with all the elements of Decision 1/CP.17.</p>
      <p>Grenada, the EU, Barbados and others opposed this proposal.</p>
      <p>With Switzerland and others, they reiterated their support for adopting the agenda as originally proposed by the Chair.</p>
      <p>Venezuela noted her country s formal reservation to Decision 1/CP.17 in Durban and highlighted that developed countries had already violated the Durban package by not putting on the table their QELROs for the second commitment period under the Protocol.</p>
      <p>Supported by Bolivia, she requested adding a footnote to the agenda to indicate that: the implementation of Decision 1/CP.17 should be examined on the basis of its compliance with international law, in accordance with the principle of pacta sunt servanda and, in particular, with the exception on non-performance related to the full respect and compliance with the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol, for the parties that are parties of those instruments.</p>
      <p>Venezuela stressed that the footnote is indispensable for her country s support for the adoption of the agenda.</p>
      <p>The US, Singapore and Switzerland preferred not including a footnote.</p>
      <p>Interim Chair de Wet stressed that the Durban outcome was a very balanced one, saying it will be difficult to delete agenda items.</p>
      <p>She urged parties to adopt the agenda as originally proposed, thereby sending a tremendous message to the international community that parties are ready to begin work under the ADP.</p>
      <p>The Philippines, supported by Ecuador, Bolivia, Malaysia, Argentina, Iran, China and others, opposed this.</p>
      <p>After further discussion, interim Chair de Wet proposed launching substantive work provisionally on the basis of the proposed agenda while conducting informal consultations on the agenda.</p>
      <p>Reconvening the ADP plenary on Tuesday, 22 May, interim Chair de Wet invited parties to share their views on how they see work proceeding under the ADP.</p>
      <p>Venezuela, speaking on behalf of Argentina, Algeria, Bahrain, Bolivia, China, Comoros, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, India, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Palestine, Paraguay, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen, expressed willingness to discuss a post-2020 mitigation framework, while recognizing the need to enhance mitigation actions in 2012-2020.</p>
      <p>He also pointed out that a separate agenda item on enhancing mitigation ambition under the ADP would render meaningless the ongoing discussions under the AWGs.</p>
      <p>He expressed support for an inclusive agenda that captures, in a non-selective manner, all the elements of Decision1/CP.17.</p>
      <p>A number of parties highlighted the key elements of the Durban package and called for launching the ADP s work as agreed in Durban.</p>
      <p>They expressed concern over efforts to undo the Durban package and delay progress.</p>
      <p>The EU, supported by Norway, highlighted the fine and balanced Durban compromise, consisting of: a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol; a pre-2020 mitigation work plan; agreement by 2015 applicable to all; concluding the AWG-LCA; and operationalizing the institutions created in Cancun and Durban.</p>
      <p>He underscored that ministers noted the ambition gap in Durban with great concern but it is not for negotiators to change the agreement.</p>
      <p>The EU also expressed concern over attempts to change the ADP s mandate to negotiate a new, legally-binding instrument applicable to all by introducing the Bali Action Plan into the new mandate.</p>
      <p>He urged agreement on the ADP agenda and said work should be launched under two contact groups.</p>
      <p>Switzerland, for the EIG, warned that attempting to change the balanced Durban package will put Doha at risk.</p>
      <p>Chile highlighted that the Durban Platform has transformative potential, and presents opportunities to increase the ambition that must be seized.</p>
      <p>With many others, he listed key elements of the Durban package, including: a second Protocol commitment period to commence in January 2013; a new legally binding agreement, concluded as early as possible but no later than 2015, in order to take effect no later than 2020; a work plan on enhancing mitigation ambition with a view to closing the ambition gap and reach an emissions trajectory consistent with the goal of limiting temperature increase to below 2°C; and the successful completion of the AWG-LCA s work at COP 18.</p>
      <p>Chile elaborated that the new agreement should include mitigation commitments by all parties, finance commitments, adaptation, technology development and transfer, transparency of action, and support and capacity building.</p>
      <p>Australia highlighted two distinct work streams under the ADP on: the development of a protocol or legally-binding agreement; and enhancing mitigation ambition.</p>
      <p>He suggested using 2012 as a conceptual year aimed at sharing ideas on the work of the ADP.</p>
      <p>Proposing the adoption of the ADP agenda based on what was agreed to in Durban, Nauru, for AOSIS, called for a detailed schedule of work with timetables and milestones.</p>
      <p>He underscored the need for a work plan for enhancing mitigation ambition.</p>
      <p>Colombia proposed establishing two contact groups on agenda items 3 and 4.</p>
      <p>The Marshall Islands emphasized the decision by ministers in Durban to launch the mitigation work plan.</p>
      <p>The US identified critically important features in the Durban Platform, highlighting an instrument with legal force for all parties and a path leading further into the future than before.</p>
      <p>He underscored two work streams with a clear mandate from the COP: developing a post-2020 regime and working on pre-2020 mitigation.</p>
      <p>Emphasizing the need to implement rather than renegotiate Decision 1/CP.17, he called for planning the ADP s work at this meeting, including input and interactions over the coming months.</p>
      <p>Brazil emphasized the importance of advancing all aspects of the Durban outcome and highlighted the main focus of the Durban Platform to create a new legal instrument under the UNFCCC as an important opportunity that must not be lost.</p>
      <p>South Africa underscored the importance of trust and mutual reassurance, upon which the Durban Package was based, including agreement to look at the level of ambition.</p>
      <p>The Russian Federation highlighted a new, comprehensive agreement as the main objective of the ADP s work and warned against using the agenda as a tool to review the fragile and multifaceted balance of interests agreed in Durban.</p>
      <p>Stressing urgency, Japan warned against wasting time on agenda discussions and called for starting substantive work in contact groups.</p>
      <p>New Zealand expressed concern over the difficult atmosphere and attempts to renegotiate ministerial agreements.</p>
      <p>She stressed that the agenda must be compatible with the Durban outcome, and proposed establishing two contact groups.</p>
      <p>Norway urged agreement on the agenda and Chairs, calling for discussions on the ADP work programme and milestones.</p>
      <p>He underscored that work must start under both work streams.</p>
      <p>Canada supported working through two groups, which would make progress possible in the discussions to raise the level of ambition and arrive at a single, global and comprehensive agreement for all parties.</p>
      <p>India underscored the importance of working on, inter alia , mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, and ensuring that the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities are fully suffused in each item.</p>
      <p>He also recalled that ambition relates to all elements of work.</p>
      <p>China emphasized the need to continue work under the AWG-LCA, according to the Bali Action Plan.</p>
      <p>He urged continued work on mitigation ambition under the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>The ADP plenary reconvened on Friday, 25 May.</p>
      <p>Interim Chair de Wet explained that she had undertaken extensive consultations on the agenda.</p>
      <p>She said the discussions had provided clarity on the future and for the organization of work.</p>
      <p>She thanked parties for their hard work, active participation, flexibility and understanding and invited them to adopt the agenda.</p>
      <p>Venezuela noted that the footnote requested by his country regarding reassurances had not been reflected in the revised agenda.</p>
      <p>He asked for the footnote to be reflected either in a miscellaneous document or in the agenda.</p>
      <p>Interim Chair de Wet responded that her understanding was that Venezuela s concerns had been addressed during informal discussions and that Venezuela s request would be reflected in the report of the session.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to reflect the footnote in a miscellaneous document and in the meeting s report.</p>
      <p>Parties then adopted the agenda as revised during informal consultations (FCCC/ADP/2012/L.1).</p>
      <p>The revised agenda contains item 3 (implementation of all the elements of Decision 1/CP.17), with paragraph (a) on matters related to paragraphs 2 to 6 and paragraph (b) on matters related to paragraphs 7 and 8.</p>
      <p>Item 3 also includes a footnote explaining that the item will be considered within the context of Decision 1/CP.17 and under the Convention, without prejudice to the position of any Party or to the work of the other Subsidiary Bodies.</p>
      <p>The footnote also indicates that two work streams are initiated under paragraphs (a) and (b), and further work streams may be considered as the need arises.</p>

      <h2>CLOSING PLENARY:</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>The ADP closing plenary took place on Friday, 25 May.</p>
      <p>Parties adopted the meeting s report (FCCC/ADP/2012/L.2).</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia, for the Asia-Pacific Group, said that electing the ADP Bureau by a vote would have had serious consequences for the UNFCCC process and highlighted the importance of preserving consensus.</p>
      <p>The Gambia, for LDCs, called for a meeting before Doha to advance the ADP s work and avoiding lengthy discussion on the organization of work.</p>
      <p>Nauru, for AOSIS, highlighted that policy decisions should be guided by science, and success will only be reached by working together.</p>
      <p>On the post-2020 period, he supported milestones and deadlines for smooth and steady progress by 2015.</p>
      <p>He supported submissions on the planning of work and on identifying ways to close the ambition gap.</p>
      <p>He said a work plan should focus on, inter alia: developed countries information on policies to increase the level of ambition; developing countries analysis of their mitigation potential and means of implementation needed; and developed countries information on potential scale up of support for enabling ambitious NAMAs.</p>
      <p>Australia, for the Umbrella Group, said the ADP should intensify global cooperation on climate change to meet the below 2ºC goal.</p>
      <p>He called for progress on the two tasks: enhancing pre-2020 mitigation ambition and negotiating a new legal agreement applicable to all.</p>
      <p>Swaziland, for the African Group, expressed hope for work under the ADP to provide an opportunity for a fair, multilateral, rules-based system in the context and principles of the Convention.</p>
      <p>He expressed disappointment that some parties have pushed back on assurances given in Durban with regard to the second commitment period under the Protocol, and also that the comparability assurance from developed countries had not been realized.</p>
      <p>He called for an increase in the level of ambition on all fronts, including through the scale-up of finance, technology transfer, and focused capacity building towards developing countries for mitigation and adaptation.</p>
      <p>The EU expressed support for adopting a ratifiable second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol in Doha as part of a transition to a single, comprehensive and global legally binding climate agreement by 2020.</p>
      <p>He also stated the need to take forward the pre-2020 mitigation work plan as agreed to in Durban.</p>
      <p>He proposed that workshops be held to take forward the two substantive work streams covered by the agenda in the ADP: one on a work plan taking parties towards the 2015 agreement, and the other on ways to enhance pre-2020 mitigation ambition.</p>
      <p>Algeria, for the G-77/China, expressed hope that the work under the ADP will lead to concrete and positive outcomes for all parties, in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention.</p>
      <p>Mexico, for the EIG, described the Durban package as a turning point in the climate negotiations, noting that substantive work must start in the next session on both work streams to increase mitigation ambition and adopt a legal instrument under the Convention that is applicable to all parties.</p>
      <p>Guyana, for GRULAC, congratulated the Chairs and Rapporteur of the ADP on their election, adding that they were pleased to be part of the leadership of the ADP, and offered the support and cooperation of GRULAC.</p>

      <p>She observed that the legal form of the outcome should not be decided up-front, nor should discussions on this be an immediate priority.</p>
      <p>Honduras, for SICA, reaffirmed adaptation as the main priority, requesting serious advancement during the next negotiating session to ensure actions and results that favor reduction of vulnerability in their region.</p>
      <p>Sierra Leone, for the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, stated that a new, international agreement is needed before 2020.</p>
      <p>He underscored the need for REDD+ mechanisms to be part of the new regime, and for private and public capital to make REDD+ phases effective.</p>

      <h2>AD HOC WORKING GROUP ON FURTHER COMMITMENTS FOR ANNEX I PARTIES UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>The AWG-KP opening plenary took place on Monday, 15 May, with Madeleine Diouf (Senegal) as the AWG-KP Chair and Jukka Uosukainen (Finland) as the AWG-KP Vice-Chair.</p>
      <p>Chair Diouf highlighted important outcomes from CMP 7 and called on parties to build on the momentum to finalize the AWG-KP s work for adoption by CMP 8 in Doha.</p>
      <p>Parties adopted the agenda and agreed to the organization of work (FCCC/KP/AWG/2012/1 and 2).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_12">
      <h2>ANNEX I FURTHER COMMITMENTS:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Chair Diouf recalled the AWG-KP s mandate to conclude its work by CMP 8 and identified issues for consideration to fulfill its mandate.</p>
      <p>These include QELROs (FCCC/KP/AWG/2012/MISC.1 and Add.1), carry-over of AAUs and proposed amendments to the Protocol, including the length of the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to establish a contact group on Annex I further commitments, co-chaired by Chair Diouf and Vice-Chair Uosukainen.</p>
      <p>A spin-off group was subsequently created, focusing on numbers and text.</p>
      <p>It was co-facilitated by Jürgen Lefevere (EU) and Sandea de Wet (South Africa), later replaced by Harald Winkler (South Africa), following de Wet s appointment as the interim ADP Chair.</p>
      <p>Legal and procedural issues were considered in informal consultations facilitated by Vice-Chair Uosukainen.</p>
      <p>Numbers/Text: On this issue (FCCC/KP/AWG/2012/MISC.1 and Add.1), parties considered a number of proposals, and inter alia : heard presentations on the parties QELROs submissions; discussed the level of ambition of parties commitments and carry-over of surplus AAUs; and reviewed options for addressing the carry-over of surplus AAUs from the first to the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>On QELROs , parties received information from Switzerland, Norway, Kazakhstan, the EU, AOSIS, Belarus, Australia, and Croatia regarding, inter alia : clarifications on QELROs submissions and associated conditions; views on market mechanisms; national policies implemented to support QELROs; and preferences for the length of the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>On ambition , the EU introduced two proposals.</p>
      <p>The first one would establish a review of the level of ambition of parties QELROs, coinciding with the 2013-2015 Review under the Convention, to address the concern raised by some parties that an eight-year commitment period would lock in a low level of ambition.</p>
      <p>The second one includes a simplified procedure to amend Protocol Annex B to facilitate an increase in the level of ambition by parties.</p>
      <p>Brazil introduced a proposal on revising QELROs with a view to strengthening commitments under the Protocol.</p>
      <p>The proposal indicates that Annex I parties may, at any time, strengthen their QELROs and ensure the immediate effect of such revision by: forfeiting a part of their AAUs; transferring these units to a cancellation account established for this purpose in the national registry; and communicating such transfer to the Secretariat.</p>
      <p>On carry-over of surplus AAUs, the African Group, AOSIS, and Brazil offered proposals and presentations.</p>
      <p>The African Group proposal states, inter alia , that surplus AAUs can be carried over but placed in a special reserve, provided that the party is participating in the second commitment period and the party s QELRO is lower than its 2008 greenhouse gas inventory.</p>
      <p>In addition, the proposal permits parties to trade 2% of the reserve per year with 1% of the revenue to be spent on domestic mitigation and 1% of AAUs to be transferred to the Adaptation Fund.</p>
      <p>The AOSIS proposal states that, inter alia , the total quantity of AAUs, Certified Emission Reductions and Emission Reduction Units approved for carry-over, and carried over from the previous commitment period, shall be deemed a party s previous period surplus reserve.</p>
      <p>It also states that after the end of the subsequent commitment period, a party may use any carried over units up to a specified quantity.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian proposal contains various paragraphs, which state that, inter alia , if the emissions of an Annex I party in a commitment period are less than its assigned amount under this article, the difference shall, on request of that party, be carried over to the subsequent commitment period.</p>
      <p>It alternatively states that if the assigned amount of an Annex I party included for the first commitment period is less than that party s emissions in 2007 multiplied by five, the difference between the assigned amount for that party for the first commitment period and its emissions in 2012 multiplied by five shall be deemed the previous period surplus reserve.</p>
      <p>Legal issues: During informal consultations facilitated by Vice-Chair Uosukainen, parties considered legal aspects of the entry into force of the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>Issues discussed included: how to secure continuity between the first and second commitment periods; the application of accounting rules in the second commitment period; options for provisional application of Protocol amendments to secure continuity pending their entry into force; and ways to raise ambition levels during the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>Parties also considered an AOSIS proposal relating to provisional application of the Protocol amendment, an AOSIS proposal for amendments and an African Groups proposal on legal issues.</p>
      <p>Many parties stressed the need for clarity on legal issues to ensure a seamless continuation of the Protocol beyond 2012.</p>
      <p>Enhanced clarity on parties positions was noted, as well as a large amount of work remaining before a successful outcome in Doha can be reached.</p>

      <h2>CLOSING PLENARY:</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>The AWG-KP closing plenary convened on Thursday, 24 May.</p>
      <p>Chair Diouf indicated that discussions in the AWG-KP contact group have advanced understanding of substantive issues.</p>
      <p>She identified issues for further consideration, including information on QELROs; carry-over of AAUs; and proposed amendments to the Kyoto Protocol, including the length of the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>On informal consultations on legal and procedural issues related to the second commitment period, she highlighted enhanced clarity on parties positions and on the options to facilitate a successful outcome in Doha, noting that a large amount of work remains.</p>
      <p>Chair Diouf suggested suspending AWG-KP 17 and resuming work at the next meeting, saying this will allow the AWG-KP to proceed promptly with the current organization of work.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to the proposal.</p>
      <p>Chair Diouf also noted wide support for an additional session before Doha, explaining that this depends on funding.</p>
      <p>Swaziland, for the African Group, highlighted, inter alia , that: the legal status of the second commitment period is not negotiable; a five-year commitment period is needed to avoid locking in low levels of ambition; and that not all Annex I parties have submitted adequate, or any, information on QELROs.</p>
      <p>He highlighted the African Group s proposal on carry-over of units, saying it gives fair reward to over-achievement, maintains environmental integrity and is flexible enough to cater for countries with special needs.</p>
      <p>He also noted monetization of AAUs to capitalize the Adaptation Fund.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Korea, for the EIG, emphasized commitment to adopting amendments to the Protocol in Doha with a view to operationalize the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>He highlighted, inter alia, that: the length of the second commitment period should be eight years; the mid-term review to enhance the level of ambition has to be conducted in the context of the scientific recommendations of the IPCC; and agreement is needed on an environmentally integral treatment of carry-over.</p>
      <p>Nauru, for AOSIS, identified the need to address surplus Kyoto units, highlighting the proposals by AOSIS and others to move this issue forward.</p>
      <p>He called for clear, unconditional, single-number QELROs for a five-year commitment period and clarifying that units from any new market mechanism under the Convention may only be used within the Kyoto accounting framework if they have been scrutinized for environmental integrity.</p>
      <p>He stressed that Protocol amendments adopted in Doha must be legally-binding on parties from 1 January 2013 onwards through the provisional application of these amendments pending their entry into force.</p>
      <p>The EU highlighted the importance of transition and continuity of rules, institutions and mechanisms.</p>
      <p>He lamented the lack of agreement on the length of the second commitment period, and reiterated support for an eight-year period.</p>
      <p>He urged other Annex B parties that have not done so to provide information on their QELROs.</p>
      <p>He called for the Durban constructive spirit to take the final steps for a second commitment period in Doha as part of progress across all tracks on the road to a single global and comprehensive legally-binding agreement.</p>
      <p>The Gambia, for LDCs, urged those Annex I parties that have not done so to submit their QELROs.</p>
      <p>He supported: a five-year commitment period to avoid locking in the current low level of ambition for eight years; having a cap on carry-over of AAUs; and the provisional application of the proposed Protocol amendments for the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>He called for: avoiding the distractions by parties wanting to jump ship ; clearing away the conditionalities; and striving for continuity.</p>
      <p>Australia, for the Umbrella Group, called for ensuring the smooth operation of the second commitment period, to commence on 1 January 2013, as well as securing a smooth post-2012 transition for the flexibility mechanisms.</p>
      <p>He welcomed the breakthrough in Durban to negotiate a new, comprehensive agreement by 2015 covering all parties, recognizing the Kyoto Protocol s role in securing the Durban outcome.</p>
      <p>He emphasized that alone, a second commitment period cannot help us avoid dangerous climate change and that it will be only one part of the bigger picture.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, expressed disappointment with the slow pace of negotiations on key issues, in particular on the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>Underscoring historical responsibility, he said, inter alia , that: emission reductions are the primary responsibility of developed countries; negotiations under the AWG-KP should be separated from other negotiations; and the flexibility mechanisms should only benefit parties undertaking commitments during the second commitment period.</p>
      <p>Ecuador, for ALBA, expressed concern with the lack of fulfillment of the legal mandate to achieve ambitious emission reductions.</p>
      <p>He said the level of ambition by developed countries is insufficient.</p>
      <p>He maintained that a central element of the Doha package must be a legal procedure for countries who did not comply with their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p>He underscored that the ADP should not jeopardize progress under the AWG-KP.</p>
      <p>Sierra Leone, for a number of members of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, expressed preference for a five-year commitment period that would better enable considering new scientific results, and highlighted the need for clear rules to ensure environmental integrity.</p>
      <p>He emphasized a link between the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA concerning units from the new market mechanism.</p>
      <p>He stressed the role of REDD+ in the new market mechanism, highlighting public and private capital, and ambitious Annex I commitments.</p>
      <p>Honduras, for SICA, expressed deep concern over delays concerning the second commitment period under the Protocol, stressing the need for urgent progress.</p>
      <p>He expressed support for a five-year commitment period.</p>
      <p>Thanking delegates, AWG-KP Chair Diouf suspended AWG-KP 17 at 5:58 pm.</p>

      <h2>AD HOC WORKING GROUP ON LONG-TERM COOPERATIVE ACTION UNDER THE CONVENTION</h2>
      <small>working group — groups</small>
      <p>Opening the session on Tuesday, 15 May, AWG-LCA Chair Aysar Tayeb (Saudi Arabia) recalled the mandate to finish the AWG-LCA s work at COP 18.</p>
      <p>On the agenda and organization of work (FCCC/AWGLCA/2012/1), he outlined intentions to establish a single contact group.</p>
      <p>He also noted that five in-session workshops will take place, as mandated by Decision 2/CP.17 (Outcome of the work of the AWG-LCA).</p>
      <p>Discussions ensued on the AWG-LCA s proposed agenda and organization of work.</p>
      <p>China, Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua expressed support for adopting the agenda as proposed.</p>
      <p>The EU lamented that the proposed agenda did not recognize specific issues that the AWG-LCA was tasked by COP 17 to take forward in 2012.</p>
      <p>He emphasized that listing the elements of the Bali Action Plan in the agenda implied that no progress had been made since COP 13.</p>
      <p>He specified that the agenda did not take into account the various new institutions created or that some of the issues had been transferred from the AWG-LCA to the SBI and SBSTA.</p>
      <p>Switzerland, for the EIG, called for clarity on the organization of work, noting that many of the items on the proposed agenda had already been addressed.</p>
      <p>The US, supported by Canada and others, expressed concern with reopening of issues and proposed establishing spin-off groups to consider issues specifically mandated by COP 17.</p>
      <p>Chair Tayeb noted that issues on the proposed agenda have enjoyed different levels of progress and listing them on the agenda did not imply that they were going to be reopened.</p>
      <p>Informal consultations on the agenda followed.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, 17 May, Chair Tayeb reported to the plenary that agreement had been reached on the agenda, with a footnote stating that items on the agenda enjoy different levels of progress through decisions adopted by COP 16 and COP 17, and some items may not need further work under the AWG-LCA taking into account the progress made.</p>
      <p>He also noted agreement to proceed in the single contact group; rapidly launch spin-off groups to consider tasks mandated in Durban; and evaluate progress through the single contact group to decide where additional spin-off groups are needed.</p>
      <p>Chair Tayeb also said he will consult informally on Annex I parties whose special circumstances have been recognized by the COP.</p>
      <p>Parties then adopted the revised agenda (FCCC/AWGLCA/2012/L.1) and agreed to establish a single AWG-LCA contact group, chaired by Tayeb.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_15">
      <h2>AGENDA ITEMS 3, 4 AND 5:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>Discussions in the AWG-LCA contact group focused on agenda items 3 (preparation of an agreed, comprehensive and balanced outcome to COP 18), 4 (review) and 5 (other matters).</p>
      <p>At the first contact group meeting on Friday, 18 May, parties debated whether spin-off groups would only focus on the implementation of tasks mandated by COP 17.</p>
      <p>Agreement was reached to launch spin-off groups on tasks mandated by COP 17, including on: shared vision; developed country mitigation; developing country mitigation; REDD+; sectoral approaches; various approaches, including markets; and Review.</p>
      <p>Progress made under the AWG-LCA since the adoption of the Bali Action Plan and the need for additional spin-off groups was debated during subsequent contact group meetings.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries called for spin-off groups on adaptation, finance, technology and response measures, underscoring outstanding issues.</p>
      <p>Developed countries opposed, highlighting progress made under the AWG-LCA and establishment of various new institutions and processes.</p>
      <p>Belarus, for Kazakhstan, Ukraine and the Russian Federation, supported a spin-off group on other matters and EITs.</p>
      <p>At the AWG-LCA closing plenary on Thursday, 24 May, Chair Tayeb said discussions in the AWG-LCA contact group had been helpful in furthering parties understanding of each other s views.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed that the oral reports and summaries of the issues discussed under the contact group will be made available online and can be used in future discussions, but they have no formal status.</p>
      <p>The reports can be accessed at: http://unfccc.int/meetings/bonn_may_2012/session/6646.php .</p>
      <p>Discussions on issues under the AWG-LCA contact group are summarized below under the respective agenda items and sub-items.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_16">
      <h2>Shared Vision</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Discussions in the informal group on shared vision, facilitated by Zou Ji (China), focused on identifying possible areas of convergence.</p>
      <p>Botswana, for the African Group, Uganda, for LDCs, China, Brazil and others stressed the importance of the means of implementation.</p>
      <p>Some developing countries urged for a discussion on the context, whereas several developed countries said the focus should be on the global goal for emission reductions and timeframe for peaking.</p>
      <p>China, supported by Brazil, requested that the importance of context be included in the Facilitator s report.</p>
      <p>Mexico, the Philippines and others said that relevant contextual elements need to be defined.</p>
      <p>Trinidad and Tobago, for AOSIS, said that burden-sharing cannot be discussed without identifying the burden first.</p>
      <p>While many parties supported discussion of the context for identifying the goals, their views differed on the context.</p>
      <p>Some parties suggested the principle of equity is key for considering, inter alia : contributions, capabilities and circumstances.</p>
      <p>Some developing countries drew attention to trade, response measures and intellectual property rights (IPRs) as potential elements within the context.</p>
      <p>In the final AWG-LCA contact group meeting, three options were identified for consideration: specific numbers for goals with context; range of numbers for goals with context; or process or mechanism with which to work on a specific number or range of numbers for goals.</p>
      <p>Facilitator Ji underscored the AWG-LCA workshop on equitable access to sustainable development as a good opportunity to exchange views.</p>
      <p>Among key issues, he highlighted discussions on context for equity and equitable access to sustainable development; definition of equity; and application of the equity principle.</p>
      <p>For more details on the workshop, see: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12538e.html .</p>
      <p>Mitigation: Developed country mitigation: Developed country mitigation was considered in a spin-off group and an in-session workshop.</p>
      <p>The workshop on clarification of developed country parties quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets and related assumptions and conditions took placed on Thursday, 17 May.</p>
      <p>For more details on the workshop, see: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12539e.html .</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, 22 May, the spin-off group on mitigation by developed country parties convened for the first time, facilitated by Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia).</p>
      <p>The EU, Norway, the US, Japan and other developed countries identified the ADP as the appropriate place for discussing mitigation ambition.</p>
      <p>India highlighted that discussions should be based on the Bali Action Plan, which mandates comparable efforts among developed countries.</p>
      <p>Ecuador underscored that the AWG-LCA should not conclude its work before the Bali Action Plan mandate on developed country mitigation has been fulfilled.</p>
      <p>A number of developed countries highlighted the agreement to terminate the work of the AWG-LCA in Doha.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries supported further work on common accounting rules, with South Africa calling for considering comparability and compliance.</p>
      <p>Parties also suggested that the group focus on further clarifying assumptions underlying developed country pledges.</p>
      <p>China indicated that progress on comparability of developed countries mitigation efforts is required, otherwise the Bali Action Plan mandate will not be accomplished and the AWG-LCA will not be able to terminate its work at Doha.</p>
      <p>India suggested the group elaborate a robust set of rules on accountability and enhancement of mitigation ambition.</p>
      <p>Many developed countries supported an updated technical paper and further workshops on understanding underlying assumptions.</p>
      <p>In the final AWG-LCA contact group meeting on 24 May, Facilitator Kranjc reported on substantive issues and suggestions for the way forward.</p>
      <p>On substantive issues, he noted, inter alia : that all parties agreed to the continuation of the process to clarify developed country parties quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets is essential to enable the understanding of various issues, such as assumptions and conditions associated with the targets.</p>
      <p>He also noted a number of divergent views around issues related to, inter alia : the comparability of efforts by all developed country parties as outlined in the Bali Action Plan and whether the ambition gap should be addressed in the AWG-LCA, ADP, or other bodies under the Convention.</p>
      <p>On the way forward, the group agreed, inter alia : to continue working on the clarification of targets in workshops, but in a more rigorous way and on the usefulness of updating the technical paper (FCCC/TP/2012/2) to incorporate additional information provided by parties.</p>
      <p>Divergent views were reported on the following: whether the update of the technical paper should be preceded by further submissions from developed country parties in the form of an agreed and updated common template; and on the next steps in and after Doha, including if the process of clarifying targets should continue, and if specific work should be carried out under the subsidiary bodies (SBs).</p>
      <p>Developing country mitigation: Developing country mitigation was considered in a spin-off group and an in-session workshop.</p>
      <p>The workshop to further the understanding of the diversity of NAMAs by developing country parties, underlying assumptions, and any support needed for implementation of these actions took place on Friday, 18 May.</p>
      <p>For more details on the workshop, see: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12540e.html.</p>
      <p>The spin-off group was facilitated by Gary Theseira (Malaysia).</p>
      <p>It discussed the tasks mandated by Decision 2/CP.17.</p>
      <p>There were divergent views on how to take the work forward and three options were considered, namely: - the organization of a workshop to further the understanding of the diversity of NAMAs, structured around the elements identified in Decision 2/CP.17, paragraph 34, including assumptions and methodologies, sectors and greenhouse gases, support needs and others; - that the Secretariat prepare a synthesis report or compilation paper gathering the information provided by developing country parties on their NAMAs through submissions or workshops; and - any future workshop should not focus on understanding the diversity of NAMAs or the elements of Decision 2/CP.17, paragraph 34, but on other issues.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to have a focused workshop on specific NAMAs, structured in accordance with Decision 2/CP.17, that pays particular attention to support needs, but not limited to this.</p>
      <p>Other issues discussed include: considering the diversity of NAMAs under the Subsidiary Bodies after the AWG-LCA finishes its work; developing guidelines for MRV of support; work on the understanding of means of implementation; and developing a common template for pledges from non-Annex I Parties listed in FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/INF.1.</p>

      <h2>REDD+</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>REDD+ was considered in a spin-off group, facilitated by Yaw Osafo (Ghana).</p>
      <p>Issues discussed included: parties submissions on REDD+ financing related issues; what parties want to achieve in Doha; and the way forward.</p>
      <p>On party submissions on REDD+ finance, Guyana, supported by the Philippines, highlighted that the 2ºC target can only be achieved if REDD+ is part of the solution.</p>
      <p>With many others, he underscored that the required scale of financing can only be provided through a variety of sources.</p>
      <p>Many parties also supported a REDD+ window in the Green Climate Fund.</p>
      <p>China and others expressed a preference for public sources of financing, with China saying he is open to explore other sources.</p>
      <p>Mexico elaborated on a proposal that parties participating in REDD+ establish a national registry to account for the verified emission reductions and carbon stock units and inform a UNFCCC REDD+ registry to prevent double counting.</p>
      <p>Brazil supported further work on new ideas on appropriate market-based mechanisms excluding generation of offsets.</p>
      <p>Bolivia suggested further work on non-market approaches.</p>
      <p>The EU said REDD+ emission reductions results should be assessed against independent review.</p>
      <p>With Switzerland and India, he suggested further work on definitions.</p>
      <p>Some parties highlighted the relevance of enhancing understanding of results based performance.</p>
      <p>On what parties want to achieve in Doha, in particular on conditions necessary for financing REDD+ results-based actions, some countries preferred broader discussions, with some cautioning on the use of the word conditions.</p>
      <p>Key issues discussed included, inter alia : how the finance landscape for the post-2012 period will allow countries to implement REDD+; a new market mechanism for REDD+ phase 3; fixing the gap for supporting REDD+ preparatory phases; whether to forward the work on finance to the SBI and the scope of this work; MRV of support; support for related activities that do not deliver carbon sequestration, such as adaptation; and interlinkages with discussions held in other groups, such as finance and various approaches.</p>
      <p>On the way forward, Chair Tayeb highlighted that the Secretariat will prepare a technical paper, as well as efforts to organize the REDD+ workshop before Doha, despite financing difficulties.</p>
      <p>Many parties expressed support for organizing the workshop, with some suggesting potential areas to focus on.</p>
      <p>Sectoral approaches: The AWG-LCA spin-off group on sectoral approaches and sector-specific actions convened twice, facilitated by George Wamukaya (Kenya).</p>
      <p>Parties reflected on the way forward in light of Decision 2/CP.17, which agrees to continue work towards a general framework (paragraph 74) and issues related to addressing emissions from international aviation and maritime transport (paragraph 78).</p>
      <p>During the spin-off groups, parties: expressed a willingness to move this item forward within a multilateral setting; reiterated the importance of sectoral approaches and sector-specific actions; and reflected on how to finish or transition work in light of the AWG-LCA s mandate to terminate work in Doha.</p>
      <p>Views varied on the framing of a general framework that would apply to all sectors as set out in Convention Article 4.1(c) (reducing emissions on relevant sectors).</p>
      <p>Parties emphasized that such a framework should not inhibit investment and growth in these sectors.</p>
      <p>On emissions from international transport, parties recognized the roles of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO) and emphasized the importance of the UNFCCC to send a signal to these bodies for reducing emissions.</p>
      <p>Party views varied, however, on how to package the signal to these bodies.</p>
      <p>On the way forward, many parties expressed that more time is needed before submitting proposals for text that could form the basis of negotiations in the coming sessions.</p>
      <p>Parties also welcomed the opportunity to make submissions on paragraphs 74 and 78, which will be made available on the UNFCCC website to form the basis of future work at the next session.</p>
      <p>Various approaches: Various approaches, including markets, were considered in a spin-off group, facilitated by Alexa Kleysteuber (Chile), and two in-session workshops.</p>
      <p>For more details on the workshops, held on Saturday, 19 May, see: http://www.iisd.ca/download/pdf/enb12541e.pdf .</p>
      <p>In the spin-off group, parties were invited to consider various approaches, including opportunities for using markets, to enhance the cost-effectiveness of, and to promote, mitigation actions, bearing in mind different circumstances of developed and developing countries.</p>
      <p>On a framework for various approaches, parties focused discussions on paragraph 79 of Decision 2/CP.17 concerning the need for robust standards that deliver real, permanent, additional and verified mitigation outcomes, avoidance of double counting, and achievement of a net decrease and/or avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>On the new market-based mechanism, parties discussed the need to elaborate modalities and procedures for, as well as specific elements of, such a mechanism.</p>
      <p>Parties requested that the Secretariat prepare a technical paper, and agreed to focus further discussions through workshops.</p>
      <p>Response measures: Response measures were discussed in the AWG-LCA contact group.</p>
      <p>India called for a spin-off group to address unresolved issues on response measures with clear timelines.</p>
      <p>He elaborated on discussions needed under the AWG-LCA and indicated that the statement, supported by several developing countries, would be delivered to the AWG-LCA Chair.</p>
      <p>Australia opposed a spin-off group, pointing to Decision 2/CP.17, which consolidates all progressive discussions related to response measures under the Convention.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia stressed that parties are working to complete and not consolidate work, and that he does not see a mandate for consolidation.</p>
      <p>The US explained that work in Durban was painstakingly negotiated.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia, China, Kuwait, Venezuela, Argentina, India and others, opposed by the EU, Singapore, Mexico, Australia and the US, suggested considering trade measures.</p>
      <p>Some parties highlighted the World Trade Organization as the appropriate forum to consider trade measures.</p>
      <p>Summarizing discussions in the final AWG-LCA contact group, Chair Tayeb explained that a number of parties had expressed the view that response measures have not yet been fully addressed by the AWG-LCA, while others argue that the consideration of the issue has been completed.</p>
      <p>Adaptation: Adaptation was discussed in the AWG-LCA contact group.</p>
      <p>Algeria, for the African Group, the Philippines, Argentina, Nicaragua and other developing countries called for establishing a spin-off group on adaptation, noting the need to further consider NAPs for developing countries that are not LDCs.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh, for LDCs, also drew attention to gaps in terms of scaling up support, transparency, accounting, risk management and risk reduction strategies.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia called for addressing economic diversification to build resilience and Egypt highlighted vulnerability assessments and developing countries urgent needs.</p>
      <p>The Philippines, for the G-77/China, highlighted that some areas of the Bali Action Plan have not been thoroughly addressed and that the mechanisms established for adaptation and other issues are not yet operational.</p>
      <p>Opposing the establishment of a spin-off group on adaptation, Switzerland, Norway, the EU and other developed countries pointed to progress and current work under other bodies on, inter alia , the Adaptation Committee, and loss and damage.</p>
      <p>Chair Tayeb noted in the final contact group that a number of issues were identified during the discussion under adaptation, but there were divergent views about the issues raised and how they are to be addressed.</p>
      <p>Finance: Issues related to finance were discussed in the AWG-LCA contact group.</p>
      <p>The Philippines, for the G-77/China, Algeria, for the African Group, Cuba, Egypt, Indonesia, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, India and others, opposed by the US and the EU, called for establishing a spin-off group on finance.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China stressed finance as one of the most important pillars of the Bali Action Plan.</p>
      <p>With many others, she emphasized the need to consider transparency of fast-start finance and the lack of agreement on long-term finance.</p>
      <p>She stressed the need to discuss financial support for: NAPs in developing countries other than LDCs; biennial update reports; and reporting and verification.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China also stressed that the financial institutions that we have now are empty shells and, with the African Group and many developing countries, expressed concern over the finance gap between 2012 and 2020.</p>
      <p>Egypt, Pakistan and others called for the consideration of how to conclude institutional arrangements between the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the COP.</p>
      <p>The EU indicated that the AWG-LCA is not the proper forum to discuss arrangements between the COP and the GCF.</p>
      <p>China called for capitalizing the GCF and for the Standing Committee to start its work as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia stated that special attention is needed for the public and private sourcing of finance.</p>
      <p>Pakistan stressed that closing the finance gap is just as important as closing the mitigation gap.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries drew attention to the funding gap from 2013 to 2020, underscoring the need for scaling up finance and for ensuring new, additional and predictable funding.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh proposed an incremental increase from 2013 to 2020.</p>
      <p>He also called for a balanced allocation between mitigation and adaptation.</p>
      <p>Colombia suggested considering an intermediate funding target for the mid-term period.</p>
      <p>Barbados proposed an additional mid-term period of commitments like fast-start finance.</p>
      <p>He also indicated that the US$100 billion per year of long-term finance would be grossly inadequate for assisting countries in adaptation.</p>
      <p>The US noted that the 2020 finance goal was made in the context of meaningful mitigation action for 2020, questioning whether those parties calling for mid-term finance commitments would also take on mid-term mitigation commitments.</p>
      <p>The US and the EU emphasized that: developed countries have provided assurance that there will be no financing gap in 2012-20; a work programme on long-term finance has been established; and developed countries are fully committed to providing fast-start finance.</p>
      <p>The EU also indicated that decisions on provision of finance have been taken in Durban and Cancun.</p>
      <p>Chair Tayeb reported to the final AWG-LCA contact group that a number of issues were identified during the discussion on finance and that there were divergent views about the issues raised and how they are to be addressed.</p>
      <p>Technology: On technology, many developing countries supported establishing a spin-off group.</p>
      <p>Japan, the EU and other developed countries opposed a spin-off group on technology.</p>
      <p>The G-77/China underscored the issue as one of the four pillars of the Bali Action Plan and called for further discussions, in particular on IPRs.</p>
      <p>Algeria, for the African Group, called for a clear distinction between issues to be addressed under the ADP for the post-2020 regime and issues to be finished by the AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>Many developed countries drew attention to progress on technology and its consideration under other UNFCCC bodies.</p>
      <p>The US and Singapore indicated that there are other avenues to discuss IPRs.</p>
      <p>Bolivia suggested further discussion on, inter alia , barriers to development and transfer of technologies and IPRs that are in the public domain.</p>
      <p>Developing countries listed issues for further consideration, including: IPRs; linkages between the technology and financial mechanisms; possible additional functions for the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) in evaluating environmental aspects of technology; and the relationship between the TEC and the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN).</p>
      <p>During the final AWG-LCA contact group, Chair Tayeb, assisted by Kunihiko Shimada (Japan), reported that parties had an opportunity to have a focused discussion on issues relating to IPRs, the linkage between the Technology Mechanism and the financial mechanism, and additional functions of the TEC and the CTCN.</p>
      <p>The report also reflected the diversity of parties views on these issues.</p>
      <p>Capacity Building: On capacity building, China, for the G-77/China, supported further discussion on, inter alia : institutions, financial mechanisms, monitoring and performance tools.</p>
      <p>The Philippines highlighted means of implementation.</p>
      <p>Drawing attention to the recently established Durban Forum for in-depth discussion on capacity building, the US, the EU and other developed countries opposed having a spin-off group.</p>
      <p>During the final AWG-LCA contact group, Chair Tayeb noted that although confirming the richness of information that emerged during the first meeting of the Durban Forum on Capacity Building, some parties expressed the view that it does not enable a valid assessment of the delivery of capacity building; and the identification of performance indicators to monitor and assess capacity building is an issue that still needs to be addressed by the AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>He also noted that other parties expressed the view that the AWG-LCA does not need to re-consider capacity-building, as the agreement reached in Durban on the establishment of the Durban Forum addresses substantive issues previously raised by parties.</p>

      <h2>REVIEW:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>The spin-off group on Review, facilitated Gertraud Wollansky (Austria), met twice.</p>
      <p>Parties considered an information paper highlighting the mandate of the group from Decisions 1/CP.16 and 2/CP.17.</p>
      <p>The main issues discussed were the scope of the Review and the expert consideration of inputs.</p>
      <p>On scope, Botswana, for the African Group, supported by China and Brazil, observed that the Durban decision defines the scope and modalities of the Review, and that the scope includes not just the temperature goal but also the adequacy of means of implementation for developing countries.</p>
      <p>Calling for a prompt start to the Review, Trinidad and Tobago, for AOSIS, with Singapore, the EU and others, emphasized the need for a narrow focus on scope in the context of what was agreed in Cancun.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia, China, the Philippines and the African Group drew attention to Decision 2/CP.17, which stipulates that parties will continue working on the scope of the Review and consider its further definition.</p>
      <p>AOSIS and others questioned the value of expanding the scope of the Review.</p>
      <p>On the expert consideration of inputs, Japan proposed an open-ended expert meeting format and called for avoiding duplicating the work of the IPCC.</p>
      <p>Trinidad and Tobago, for AOSIS, opposed by Botswana, for the African Group, China, Brazil and the Philippines, reiterated support for establishing an expert group, highlighting the guiding role that such a body could play.</p>
      <p>She also noted that tasking the SBs to assist with the Review does not preclude the establishment of an expert body.</p>
      <p>Norway said an expert body should support and inspire the review process.</p>
      <p>Canada, supported by the US and Australia, proposed establishing a joint SBSTA/SBI contact group to allow for full deliberation of the Review.</p>
      <p>Reporting on progress to the final AWG-LCA, Facilitator Wollansky said that there was a general understanding among parties that the work this year is to further consider the definition of the scope of the review and the expert consideration of the inputs.</p>
      <p>She highlighted two options for consideration: limiting the scope of the Review; or extending the Review.</p>
      <p>She also noted another view that there is no need to discuss scope as defined by inputs.</p>
      <p>She also noted that parties had discussed expert consideration of inputs and various options had been considered, including establishing a new body to provide guidance to review, in addition to the SBs; and that a joint SB contact group should be used because such a group would have party ownership and incur no additional cost.</p>
      <p>She noted general guidance for expert consideration including: holding meetings with sessions parallel to the SBs; calls for meetings to be open-ended; and to avoid duplication of work.</p>
      <p>She noted that beginning in 2014 intersessional activities might be required.</p>

      <h2>METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE FOR REDD+</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>This issue was first addressed in the SBSTA plenary on Thursday, 17 May.</p>
      <p>It was further addressed in a contact group and informal consultations co-chaired by Peter Graham (Canada) and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz (the Philippines).</p>
      <p>Main issues discussed included: MRV, forest monitoring systems and drivers of deforestation and forest degradation.</p>
      <p>On national forest monitoring systems , parties discussed at length the potential features of the system, with many saying it should be built on a phased approach.</p>
      <p>Parties views differed on whether activities shall or should take into account the most recent IPCC guidance.</p>
      <p>Parties discussed a robust national forest monitoring system, with some underscoring it should provide data and information that is complete, meaning that the information provided should allow the technical analysis of the results of the activities implemented.</p>
      <p>On the type of information to be collected , Bolivia highlighted that non-market approaches and information on the multiple functions of forests and adaptation should be considered.</p>
      <p>Some parties underscored that the information monitored should be selected by each country implementing REDD+.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries highlighted the need to build capacity and provide adequate support and finance.</p>
      <p>Some developed countries emphasized the need to include consideration of social and environmental safeguards within the monitoring system and stressed the need for robust information.</p>
      <p>On MRV , parties discussed possible interlinkages between MRV for NAMAs and for REDD+, with many developing countries highlighting the need to look for synergies.</p>
      <p>Some emphasized the need to find a balance between the quality and type of information required, while ensuring simplicity and avoiding overburdening developing countries.</p>
      <p>Many developing countries suggested reference to the need for MRV support.</p>
      <p>A number of parties emphasized that the system should be built on existing national monitoring systems.</p>
      <p>Many highlighted linkages with discussions in other groups, such as REDD+ financing under the AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>Some underscored that access to technology and information should be facilitated by developed countries, but others also emphasized the role of South-South cooperation.</p>
      <p>Some parties suggested the information be included in the national communications and biennial update reports.</p>
      <p>On information systems , a party suggested a technical assessment for the reference levels based on experiences and lessons learned from LULUCF.</p>
      <p>One party highlighted the need to consider lessons learned from the first report submitted.</p>
      <p>Norway suggested a step-wise approach to MRV.</p>
      <p>On drivers of deforestation and forest degradation , parties exchanged initial views.</p>
      <p>Some highlighted that drivers are different in each country and should be addressed at the domestic level.</p>
      <p>Some parties, opposed by Brazil and Argentina, suggested addressing international drivers in the draft text.</p>
      <p>Parties did not reflect discussions on drivers in the SBSTA conclusions, as some parties indicated that it was premature to reflect initial discussions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_21">
      <h2>SBSTA Conclusions</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2012/ L.9/Rev.1), the SBSTA takes note of the parties submissions, in particular on drivers of deforestation and forest degradation and on robust and transparent national forest monitoring systems.</p>
      <p>SBSTA agrees to: - continue its work on MRV on the basis of an annex containing elements for a possible draft decision; to complete this work at SBSTA 37; and prepare recommendations for a draft decision for consideration by COP 18; - continue its work on issues identified in Decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 72 and Appendix II, in particular on how to address drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, including consideration of social and economic aspects in developing countries at the national level, at SBSTA 37; - continue consideration of the timing and the frequency of the presentations of the summary of information on how all of the safeguards referred to in Decision 1/CP.16, Appendix I, are being addressed and respected, and the need for further guidance at SBSTA 37, with a view to conclude its consideration at SBSTA 39; and - initiate work on the technical assessment of the proposed forest reference emission levels and/or forest reference levels at SBSTA 37, to report to the COP 18 and 19 on progress made, including any recommendations for a draft decision on this matter.</p>
      <p>The SBSTA recognizes that: - further work on methodological guidance may be needed pending the outcome of the work of the AWG-LCA; - parties aiming to undertake the activities referred to in Decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 70, could consider the adaptation needs of the country concerned; and - the annex on elements for a possible draft decision contains bracketed text structured under two subheadings: modalities for national forest monitoring systems and MRV.</p>

      <h2>CLOSING PLENARY:</h2>
      <small>working group — plenary</small>
      <p>The AWG-LCA closing plenary took place late in the evening on Thursday, 24 May.</p>
      <p>Parties agreed to suspend the session to allow the AWG-LCA to resume work at its next meeting.</p>
      <p>Algeria, for the G-77/China, stressed the need for an AWG-LCA outcome in Doha to be in line with the Bali Action Plan and decisions taken in Cancun and Durban.</p>
      <p>She called for further progress, inter alia , on adaptation and technology, and an additional negotiating session in Bangkok to allow the AWG-LCA to fulfill its mandate.</p>
      <p>Australia, for the Umbrella Group, underscored efforts undertaken since 2007 to fulfill the AWG-LCA s mandate and build confidence among parties, including the establishment of transparency requirements for all parties, the Adaptation Framework and the GCF.</p>
      <p>He said the AWG-LCA was mandated by COP 17 to complete selected activities and suggested that issues requiring more technical consideration after Doha be taken up in the permanent SBs.</p>
      <p>The EU highlighted the task in Bonn was to take forward what was mandated in Durban and lamented lack of sufficient progress.</p>
      <p>She indicated that some items from the Bali Action Plan may not need further work, saying this does not imply that they are less important.</p>
      <p>She expressed concern over attempts to reopen issues as this could jeopardize the goal of successfully terminating the AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>She cautioned against automatically transferring issues from the AWG-LCA to the ADP, and supported working in a more effective way, taking into consideration decisions taken in Durban and Cancun.</p>
      <p>Switzerland, for the EIG, highlighted that the AWG-LCA is close to fulfilling the Bali Action Plan mandate after the decisions taken in Cancun and Durban.</p>
      <p>He called for the successful conclusion of the AWG-LCA in Doha and suggested taking forward specific tasks to the SBs and relevant institutions.</p>
      <p>He indicated that Doha must deliver on the Durban package, including on the clarification of pledges, understanding the diversity of NAMAs, Review and REDD+.</p>
      <p>Swaziland, for the African Group, urged the AWG-LCA to give full consideration to adaptation, finance, response measures, and technology transfer and shared vision.</p>
      <p>On adaptation, he highlighted the need to scale up financial and technology support, and to include NAPs for both LDCs and vulnerable developing countries.</p>
      <p>Nauru, for AOSIS, proposed a workshop on common accounting rules to be held in Bangkok and indicated that it should be a full negotiating session.</p>
      <p>He also proposed a workshop on the diversity of NAMAs for developing countries, highlighting the need for the AWG-LCA to start discussion on the post-2012 financing.</p>
      <p>The Gambia, for LDCs, called for a spin-off group on the scale of funding, based on the needs of developing countries.</p>
      <p>Egypt, for the Arab Group, identified the need for an additional negotiating session before Doha to allow more time for the AWG-LCA to reach clear agreements, underlining the need for specific results.</p>
      <p>He proposed a workshop on threats of climate change to developing countries.</p>
      <p>Cuba, for ALBA, urged for adequate completion of the work of the AWG-LCA and highlighted support for the Bali Roadmap.</p>
      <p>Sierra Leone, for a number of members of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, stressed the need for an implementable REDD+ mechanism by Doha and called for discussions on REDD+ financing, including a dedicated window in the GCF.</p>
      <p>Tajikistan, for Mountainous Landlocked Developing Countries, stressed the importance of long-term finance and the provision of assistance to all developing countries, saying exclusive language will not be acceptable to the group.</p>
      <p>The Philippines, for 36 developing countries, underscored the Convention s principles, including common but differentiated responsibilities and equity.</p>
      <p>He underscored unresolved issues under the AWG-LCA and warned against prematurely agreeing on the conclusion of the AWG-LCA in Doha without ensuring an agreed outcome on all elements of the Bali Action Plan mandate.</p>
      <p>The AWG-LCA adopted the report of the session (FCCC/AWGLCA/2012/L.2).</p>
      <p>Chair Tayeb underscored the need to start thinking about the agreed outcome to be reached at COP 18.</p>
      <p>He suspended AWG-LCA 15 at 11:59 pm.</p>

      <h2>SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE</h2>
      <small></small>

      <h2>A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE BONN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE</h2>
      <small>ANALYSIS</small>
      <p>Six months ago, many delegates left the UN Climate Change Conference in Durban basking in the warm glow of success, imbued with the infectious spirit of Ubuntu, or unity and interconnectedness.</p>
      <p>The conference had agreed on several landmark decisions including: the establishment a new Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) and a process to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force applicable to all parties to come into effect from 2020 onwards; a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol; and agreement to terminate the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA) and Ad Hoc Working Group on Annex I Parties Further Commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP) in Doha.</p>
      <p>Many saw these decisions as heralding a new era of multilateralism and turned to 2012 with anticipation, vigor and purpose.</p>
      <p>Six months later, the pressure was on delegates in Bonn to live up to the promise of Durban.</p>
      <p>Delegates faced a heavy workload, including the tasks needed to operationalize the institutions and mechanisms established in Cancun and Durban.</p>
      <p>Parties also had to try to demystify what it was they had actually agreed to during the waning hours of the frenzied COP 17.</p>
      <p>However, negotiations in 2012 got off to an inauspicious start and the Bonn Climate Change Conference was marred by mistrust and unabashed posturing.</p>
      <p>The meeting was almost paralyzed by prolonged procedural wrangling, which many described as unprecedented.</p>
      <p>This analysis will discuss the underlying reasons for the disputes in Bonn and examine the implications for COP 18 in Doha, Qatar, in another six months.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_88">
      <h2>UNRAVELING DURBAN S CONSTRUCTIVE AMBIGUITY</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>Many could not begin to imagine how difficult it would be to begin implementing the Durban decisions.</p>
      <p>The new platform established in Durban introduced the notions of a post-2012 or pre-2020 landscape; and a post-2020 period, that will be covered by the new protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties to be developed by the ADP.</p>
      <p>The Durban Package, which had been negotiated sensitively to accommodate the myriad of parties interests, presented challenges and complexities in Bonn, when parties began the business of interpreting its ambiguous language.</p>
      <p>For example, while many parties see mitigation as the core of the ADP, some developing countries insisted that all elements, including financing, adaptation, capacity building and technology transfer, should also be central to the ADP s mandate.</p>
      <p>For many, enhancing ambition to close the mitigation gap was a crucial part of Decision 1/CP.17.</p>
      <p>The decision establishes that the ADP process for the post-2020 regime shall raise the level of ambition and also launches a post-2012 work plan on enhancing mitigation ambition for all parties.</p>
      <p>However, the decision does not stipulate when and which body will implement the work plan.</p>
      <p>While some developing parties supported addressing pre-2020 mitigation ambition under the AWG-LCA, many others insisted on addressing it under the ADP.</p>
      <p>The reason why some preferred to address enhancing mitigation ambition under the AWG-LCA is that the Bali Action Plan affirms the Convention s core principles, including common but differentiated responsibilities.</p>
      <p>This implies that developed countries have commitments, while developing countries only take nationally appropriate mitigation actions contingent on support from developed countries.</p>
      <p>This level of comfort is missing under the ADP for developing countries.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the decision adopting the ADP does not include references to the Convention s principles nor does it make a distinction between developed and developing countries.</p>
      <p>As one insider highlighted, some parties have started to panic about the ADP; they feel as if they are walking into a dark room and don t know if there is anything there or where anything is.</p>
      <p>This uncertainty manifested in disagreements over both the AWG-LCA and the ADP agendas.</p>
      <p>On the ADP agenda, parties ultimately agreed to address two work streams, one on the post-2020 regime and the other on the post-2012 work plan on enhancing the level of ambition.</p>
      <p>Uncertainties also arose when considering the termination of the AWG-LCA in Doha.</p>
      <p>Decision 1/CP.17 extends the AWG-LCA s mandate for one year in order for it to continue its work and reach the agreed outcome pursuant to decision 1/CP.13 (Bali Action Plan) , until COP 18 at which it shall be terminated.</p>
      <p>However, Durban left room for different interpretations on how to proceed with the inconclusive work beyond Doha.</p>
      <p>The lack of clarity on the AWG-LCA termination provided room for discussions on whether the AWG-LCA should finish after the Bali Action Plan was accomplished or if the Bali Action Plan was accomplished by the termination of the AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>Some parties, particularly a group of developing countries, wanted to assess the progress achieved toward fulfilling the Bali Action Plan, including some elements that were not agreed upon in Durban but were reflected in a compilation document referred to as CRP.39, such as intellectual property issues in relation to technology, rights of Mother Earth, trade, and response measures.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, many developed countries wanted to focus on specific issues mandated by COP 17.</p>
      <p>They highlighted that many issues mandated by the Bali Action Plan had already been properly addressed and forwarded to the permanent subsidiary bodies or other relevant institutions created for that purpose, such as the Technology Executive Committee, the Green Climate Fund, the Adaptation Committee and the Durban Forum on Capacity Building.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the extent to which the permanent subsidiary bodies and the new bodies can address these issues is limited to their technical nature or their particular mandate.</p>
      <p>Moreover, many of the established bodies still need to be operationalized, as many highlighted.</p>
      <p>The fact that progress towards their operationalization was not achieved in Bonn did not help to enhance the environment of cooperation.</p>
      <p>On finance, the Philippines provided examples of this phenomenon, underscoring that the GCF is still an empty shell, and the Standing Committee is not standing.</p>
      <p>In Durban, under the AWG-KP track, parties agreed to decide that the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol shall begin on 1 January 2013.</p>
      <p>However, it is clear to everybody that to really adopt the second commitment period parties will have to agree on its length, put forward QELROs and adopt the necessary amendments to the Kyoto Protocol in Doha.</p>
      <p>Some questions remain on key issues such as how to ensure a smooth transition to the second commitment period, how to deal with excess units from the first commitment period, how rules can be continued and, in particular, how to continue with the flexibility mechanisms, including who will be able to participate, given that some countries indicated they would not be part of a second commitment period.</p>
      <p>In Bonn, developing countries reiterated that parties intending to participate in the second commitment period should submit ambitious QELROs in line with the goal of limiting temperature increase to below 2°C.</p>
      <p>Venezuela vociferously demanded that Annex I parties show their QELROs as opposed to pledges.</p>
      <p>The EU highlighted their submission of QELROs and also called upon his Annex B colleagues to follow suit.</p>
      <p>Moreover, in order to finish shaping the second commitment period and properly adopt it in Doha, parties have to agree on its length and on the text of the Kyoto Protocol amendment, but negotiations in Bonn did not lead to any further progress in this regard.</p>
      <p>With so many relevant details to be defined before Doha, developing countries expressed fear that parties are jumping from the Kyoto Protocol ship by shifting the focus on the ADP.</p>
      <p>The EU and other developed countries argued, in turn, that their agreement on a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol was based on a transition to a global and comprehensive post-2020 climate treaty to be negotiated under the ADP.</p>

    <div id="section_89">
      <h2>EVOLVING DYNAMICS IN A CHANGING WORLD</h2>
      <small></small>
      <p>If anything, the Bonn session brought to the fore the universally acknowledged fact that the UNFCCC, drafted in 1992, reflects a reality light years away from the 2012 global landscape.</p>
      <p>Since the negotiation of the Convention, the outlook for many G-77/China members has changed dramatically and resulting tensions from these divergences are increasingly playing out in the negotiating rooms.</p>
      <p>For several years now, many have been wagering bets on how long the G-77/China tinderbox diplomacy can prevail, when it is evident that many of the members appear to sit uncomfortably around the same table.</p>
      <p>A discernible chasm was evident in Bonn.</p>
      <p>As one delegate said, Members of the group are now washing their dirty linen very publically.</p>
      <p>The group did not have a common negotiating position on the ADP and many other issues.</p>
      <p>Moreover, they had trouble agreeing on fielding one non-Annex I candidate for the position of ADP Chair.</p>
      <p>As one practitioner explained, the UNFCCC governance structure assumed certain things, including that parties fall neatly into two groups: Annex I and non-Annex I countries.</p>
      <p>This binary dynamic has changed.</p>
      <p>As one delegate noted: GRULAC and the Asian Group are the dominant forces but they do not represent the interests of the entire group.</p>
      <p>This means that, in addition to the traditional distinction between developed and developing countries, a third category of emerging developing countries or advanced developing countries may need to be factored into the mix.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the specter of having to vote for the ADP officers and the resulting damage to the process proved too much for parties to stomach, and they eventually agreed to a delicate arrangement, where the candidate from the Asia-Pacific Group will serve an initial one year term from 2012-2013, with his counterpart from an Annex I party, and the subsequent Co-Chair from GRULAC will serve for a term of 18 months.</p>
      <p>Many said that creating a voting precedent under the UNFCCC would be difficult, almost unfathomable but, at times during the meeting it appeared as if the taboo would be broken.</p>
      <p>Other dynamics also played out within the G-77/China, which caught many practitioners by surprise.</p>
      <p>Bonn witnessed the emergence of a group of approximately 40 countries primarily comprised of the Arab Group, Latin American countries, including Argentina, Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador, as well as India and China, who, on the face on things, appear to have forged an alliance to uphold the Convention s principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and equity, as well as developed countries historical responsibility for climate change.</p>
      <p>They maintain that any outcome under the ADP must be equitable so that universality of application does not become uniformity of application.</p>
      <p>In contrast, another group of developing countries, including members from AOSIS, LDCs, and some Latin American countries, such as Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Peru and Panama, are looking for such action on mitigation from developed and developing countries and for action to be incentivized for all countries, which they describe as the beginning of a new paradigm for responding to climate change.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the developments within the G-77/China, one insider said history is being made and the wedge within the group is helping to bring about an exciting geo-political shift, which is about how countries deal with each other politically and economically and also a reflection of where they are and where they will be.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_90">
      <h2>LOOKING AHEAD</h2>
      <small>AGENDA</small>
      <p>Bonn demonstrated that, as many have said, Durban was a carefully negotiated package contingent on all elements of the outcome moving forward in tandem.</p>
      <p>However, what is clear is that parties have a very different perspective of what the future looks like in terms of, inter alia , the ADP s mandate, how to terminate the AWGs and what to focus on for effectively addressing climate change.</p>
      <p>As evidenced in Bonn, constructive ambiguity results in uncertainty that can sometimes breed mistrust.</p>
      <p>This mistrust is often manifested through disputes over procedure and consequently hampers progress.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, parties have their work cut out to accomplish tasks they agreed to in Durban.</p>
      <p>They will need to exercise goodwill, integrity and congeniality in order to deliver on the ultimate objective of meaningful mitigation action for the post-2012 era.</p>
