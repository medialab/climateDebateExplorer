      <p>Brazil noted that it had made major concessions and the COP should look carefully at activities implemented jointly whenever they involve Annex I and non-Annex I countries.</p>
      <p>Claiming credit for cooperation is something that runs the risk of destroying the concept that countries are responsible for their national emissions.</p>

      <p>Kamal Nath, Minister for the Environment, rejected the 'insidious moves' to divide the developing countries into separate categories.</p>
      <p>India is willing to accept a JI pilot phase with no credits if it is not an excuse to continue present consumption patterns.</p>
