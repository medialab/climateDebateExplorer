      <p>On Friday, 27 March, the AWG-LCA Chair Michael Zammit Cutajar (Malta) presented his document on the fulfillment of the Bali Action Plan and components of the agreed outcome ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2009/4 , Parts I and II).</p>
      <p>AWG-KP Chair Harald Dovland (Norway) presented his notes on the flexibility mechanisms ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/INF.2 ), LULUCF (FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/INF.1), amendments pursuant to Protocol Article 3.9 ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/3 ) and elements of text related to issues in paragraph 49 ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/4 ).</p>

      <h2>AWG-KP EVENTS:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>On Thursday, 26 March, the AWG-KP held in-depth consultations on emissions trading and the project-based mechanisms, and on LULUCF.</p>
      <p>On Friday, 27 March, the AWG-KP convened a workshop on the scale of emission reductions to be achieved by Annex I parties.</p>
      <p>The objective was to discuss informally issues related to Annex I parties further commitments, including quantitative emission reduction to be achieved and limitation objectives (QUELROs).</p>
      <p>The workshop focused on issues such as the identification of the aggregate scale of emission reductions to be achieved by Annex I parties; joint and individual contributions to the aggregate scale; and implications of issues such as the duration of commitment periods.</p>

      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h2>
      <small>working group â€” history</small>
      <p>The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p>
      <p>The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now has 192 parties.</p>
      <p>In December 1997, delegates at the third Conference of the Parties (COP 3) in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission reduction targets.</p>
      <p>These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I parties, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country.</p>
      <p>The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005, and now has 184 parties.</p>
      <p>The first Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties (COP/MOP 1) met in Montreal, Canada in 2005, and established the AWG-KP on the basis of Protocol Article 3.9, which mandates the consideration of Annex I parties further commitments at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period.</p>
      <p>In addition, COP 11 agreed in Montreal to consider long-term cooperation under the Convention through a series of four workshops known as the Convention Dialogue, which continued until COP 13.</p>

      <h2>BALI ROADMAP:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 took place in December 2007, in Bali, Indonesia.</p>
      <p>The focus of the Bali conference was on long-term issues, and negotiators spent much of their time seeking agreement on a follow-up to the Convention Dialogue.</p>
      <p>These negotiations resulted in the adoption of the Bali Action Plan, which established the AWG-LCA to focus on four key elements of long-term cooperation identified during the Convention Dialogue: mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology.</p>
      <p>The Bali Action Plan contains a non-exhaustive list of issues to be considered under each of these areas and calls for articulating a shared vision for long-term cooperative action.</p>
      <p>The Bali conference also resulted in an agreement on a two-year process, the Bali Roadmap, which covers negotiation tracks under the Convention and the Protocol and sets a deadline for concluding the negotiations at the Copenhagen conference in December 2009.</p>
      <p>The two key bodies under the Bali Roadmap are the AWG-LCA and the AWG-KP, which held four negotiation sessions in 2008: in April in Bangkok, Thailand; in June in Bonn, Germany; in August in Accra, Ghana; and in December in Poznan, Poland.</p>
      <p>During COP 14 in Poznan, AWG-LCA 4 continued discussing all the key elements of the Bali Action Plan and held an in-session workshop and ministerial roundtable on a shared vision.</p>
      <p>It mandated the AWG-LCA Chair to prepare a document for consideration by AWG-LCA 5 that would focus negotiations on the fulfillment of the Bali Action Plan, and a negotiating text for AWG-LCA 6 in June 2009.</p>
      <p>AWG-KP 6 held a strategic discussion of all elements of its work programme and decided that in order to finalize agreement on Annex I parties further commitments at COP/MOP 5, the AWG-KP needs to consider in 2009 the aggregate scale of emission reductions by Annex I parties, the contribution by parties individually or jointly to the aggregate scale, as well as other issues identified in what is known as paragraph 49.</p>
      <p>AWG-KP 6 also requested the AWG-KP Chair to prepare four notes for consideration at AWG-KP 7 on the flexibility mechanisms, LULUCF, amendments pursuant to Protocol Article 3.9, and elements of text related to issues in paragraph 49.</p>

      <h2>COMMUNITY-BASED ADAPTATION WORKSHOP:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>The Third International Workshop on Community-Based Adaptation was held in Dhaka, Bangladesh from 18-24 February 2009.</p>
      <p>The event consisted of three days of field visits to observe community-based adaptation initiatives first hand, followed by three days of interactive discussions in Dhaka.</p>
      <p>The aim of the event was to share the latest developments in adaptation planning and practices at different levels and disseminate knowledge among stakeholders with a view to integrating adaptation into national and international development programmes.</p>

      <h2>CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT WORKSHOP:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>The UNFCCC Workshop on Integrating Practices, Tools and Systems for Climate Risk Assessment and Management and Disaster Risk Reduction Strategies into National Policies and Programmes was held from 10-12 March 2009 in Havana, Cuba.</p>
      <p>The workshop aimed to identify successful examples of using tools and integrating climate risk assessment and management and disaster risk reduction into national policies and programmes.</p>
      <p>It generated a number of recommendations regarding climate-related hazards, sectoral and national planning.</p>
      <p>The workshop report will be presented to the thirtieth session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice.</p>

      <h2>INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONGRESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>The international scientific congress on climate change, Climate Change: Global Risks, Challenges and Decisions, took place from 10-12 March in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
      <p>It was organized by the International Alliance of Research Universities and aimed to provide a summary of existing scientific knowledge two years after the Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and in the run-up to COP 15.</p>
      <p>The conference concluded, inter alia , that according to recent observations, the worst-case IPCC scenario trajectories (or worse) are being realized and that avoiding dangerous climate change requires rapid, sustained and effective mitigation based on coordinated global and regional action.</p>
