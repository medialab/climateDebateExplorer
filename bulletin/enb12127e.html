      <p>Participants heard presentations and engaged in discussions on the adverse effects of climate change on food security, water resources, economic activities, coastal zones and human health.</p>
      <p>They also considered initial actions related to funding, insurance and the transfer of technology to meet the needs and circumstances of developing countries.</p>
      <p>Other issues addressed included actions to: enhance capacity for monitoring, systematic observation and vulnerability assessment in developing countries; build capacity in environmental management and integrated assessment; and identify adaptation options and facilitate appropriate adaptation. The second workshop was held from 13-15 March to consider the impact of the implementation of response measures to climate change.</p>
      <p>Participants considered methodological approaches and actions necessary under the FCCC relating to the impact of implementation of response measures on, inter alia, terms of trade, international capital flows and developmental efforts, in accordance with FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and in the light of matters related to Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects).</p>

      <p>The workshop was divided into four thematic sessions: Kyoto mechanisms, sinks, implementation issues and European international climate strategies/leadership.</p>
      <p>Regarding the mechanisms, participants highlighted the potential benefits of the use of the mechanisms, while noting that there are sound reasons for domestic action.</p>
      <p>On EU leadership, it was noted that the EU has a long-term vision and can integrate climate change policy with other issues.</p>
      <p>A number of participants urged the EU to work to maintain the environmental credibility of the Protocol.</p>
      <p>On implementation, it was noted that EU enlargement is not relevant to implementing existing obligations under the Protocol.</p>
