      <h2>Mitigation by developing countries (AWG-LCA)</h2>
      <p>Afternoon informal consultations on mitigation by developing countries under sub-paragraph 1(b)(ii) of the BAP focused on NAMAs supported by public finance.</p>
      <p>Parties conducted the first reading of the sections on support and enabling activities for NAMAs, and a NAMA mechanism in non-paper No.</p>
      <p>Discussions focused, inter alia , on the role of low-carbon emission strategies in relation to NAMAs, with several developed countries supporting the strategies and several developing countries opposing them.</p>
      <p>On a NAMA mechanism, a group of developing countries supported the option that proposes establishing a registry for actions and support. FINANCE (AWG-LCA): During informal consultations parties discussed institutional arrangements reflected in non-paper No.54.</p>
      <p>Debate centered on whether to operationalize or strengthen the financial mechanism of the Convention, with delegates unable to agree on this.</p>
      <p>A proposal was made for several parties to meet informally to reach agreement. TECHNOLOGY (AWG-LCA): The informal drafting group on technology met in the morning and afternoon.</p>
      <p>Parties discussed common elements to be captured in a new text, including: a technology mechanism or platform; centers and networks; a country-driven approach and; financial support for eligible activities.</p>
      <p>A revised, concise non-paper will be produced for Wednesday. REDD (SBSTA): In the contact group on REDD, parties discussed the draft COP decision text in Annex I of document FCCC/SBSTA/2009/3.</p>
      <p>INDONESIA and the EU called for clarification on the division of work on REDD under the SBSTA and AWG-LCA.</p>
      <p>PAPUA NEW GUINEA, CHILE, Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, and others said discussion on reference levels should be a priority.</p>

      <p>Chair Plume will prepare draft conclusions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12450e_27">
      <h2>ANNEX I EMISSION REDUCTIONS (AWG-KP)</h2>
      <p>Co-Chair Leon Charles (Grenada) opened the morning s contact group on numbers.</p>
      <p>The contact group agreed on their work programme in Copenhagen and created a smaller group to address the length and number of commitment periods and base year.</p>
      <p>Co-Chair Charles emphasized that five issues need to be resolved: a reasonable level of ambition for aggregate and individual Annex I emission reductions; clarity on use of the flexibility mechanisms and LULUCF in the pledges on the table; the length and number of commitment periods (whether five or eight years); a legally-binding base year and other reference years; and starting points for translating pledges into quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives (QELROs).</p>
      <p>The Secretariat presented the updated informal note compiling information relating to possible QELROs as submitted by parties, highlighting improved clarity on the impact of use of mechanisms and LULUCF on pledges, as well as on the pledge by Kazakhstan to reduce emissions by 15% by 2020 from 1992 levels.</p>
      <p>The EU requested information on whether carrying over Assigned Amount Units (AAUs) from the first to the second commitment period was included as an assumption in the emission reduction range in the IPCC s Fourth Assessment Report of 25-40% from 1990 levels, in order to further clarify the relation between level of ambition and what is required by science.</p>
      <p>The RUSSIAN FEDERATION highlighted its recent pledge to reduce emissions by 20-25% from 1990 levels by 2020.</p>
      <p>The Federated States of Micronesia, for AOSIS, emphasized the gap between what is required by science and the 13-19% aggregate reduction reflected by the current pledges.</p>
      <p>She stressed that this level of ambition is far from the pathway desired by vulnerable countries. OTHER ISSUES (AWG-KP): During the first contact group meeting, discussions focused on how to organize the group s work.</p>
      <p>AWG-KP Vice-Chair Harald Dovland (Norway) reminded parties that the focus is on preparing draft COP/MOP decisions or Protocol amendments.</p>
      <p>He outlined the division of the group s work into the basket of methodological issues, the flexibility mechanisms and LULUCF.</p>
      <p>He said discussions on the basket of methodological issues (comprising possible new greenhouse gases, common metrics to calculate carbon dioxide equivalence of emissions by sources and removals by sinks, and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories), would be based on Annex III of document FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/10/Add.3/Rev.3 (elements of draft COP/MOP decisions on other issues).</p>
      <p>On common metrics, Vice-Chair Dovland noted a potential overlap with the SBSTA s work.</p>
      <p>Vice-Chair Dovland then highlighted paragraph 49(c)(xii) of the report of AWG-KP 6 (analysis of efforts and achievements to date, including during the first commitment period), and indicated that following consultations delegates had agreed to deal with the issue in the numbers group rather than by the other issues group.</p>
      <p>On the flexibility mechanisms, he said the aim would be to clean up the text of the draft decisions (Annex III of document FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/10/Add.3/Rev.3 ).</p>
      <p>Parties also agreed to continue work on LULUCF through a spin-off group co-facilitated by Bryan Smith (New Zealand) and Marcelo Rocha (Brazil). LONG-TERM COOPERATIVE ACTION (AWG-LCA): Parties established drafting groups on: shared vision, facilitated by Sandea de Wet (South Africa); finance, co-facilitated by Farrukh Khan (Pakistan) and Jukka Uosukainen (Finland); technology, co-facilitated by Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Kunihiko Shimada (Japan); capacity building, co-facilitated by Lilian Portillo (Paraguay) and Georg Børsting (Norway); and adaptation, co-facilitated by William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) and Thomas Kolly (Switzerland).</p>
      <p>On mitigation, Chair Zammit Cutajar suggested that drafting groups will meet on: nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs), supported by public finance, facilitated by Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe); REDD-plus, facilitated by Tony La Viña (the Philippines); general aspects of sectoral approaches and the agricultural sector, facilitated by Magdalena Preve (Uruguay); and response measures, facilitated by Richard Muyungi (Tanzania).</p>
      <p>Chair Zammit Cutajar further explained that mitigation issues not considered by drafting groups will first be addressed in closed informal consultations under his chairmanship.</p>
      <p>Chair Zammit Cutajar also proposed that consultations be conducted on non-market approaches to cost-effectiveness, facilitated by Maria del Socorro Flores (Mexico), and the crosscutting issues such as sources and scales of adaptation funding, and matching NAMAs with support.</p>
      <p>Chair Zammit Cutajar will also consult parties bilaterally on the legal form of the outcome. AUSTRALIA suggested considering institutional arrangements and MRV as crosscutting issues, while BARBADOS expressed concern with the latter suggestion.</p>
      <p>SAUDI ARABIA underlined the importance of negotiating the full package and several countries, including the EU, JAPAN and CUBA, called for ensuring coherence.</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA, with BOLIVIA and ALGERIA, expressed concern with the proliferation of groups.</p>
      <p>EGYPT noted that substance should be discussed before interlinkages and, with VENEZUELA, stressed that there should be one outcome in one process and not different outcomes in different processes.</p>
      <p>The EU noted the importance of discussing HFCs and bunker fuels, and AUSTRALIA, with MALAWI, proposed establishing a drafting group on bunker fuels.</p>
      <p>BARBADOS highlighted the need to consider a mechanism to address loss and damage. POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES (AWG-KP): In the afternoon contact group, parties moved forward with a second reading of the text ( FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/12/Rev.2 ).</p>
      <p>The EU stressed that it is premature to decide whether the text will become a COP/MOP decision or conclusions, while South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, hoped that they would achieve more than a conclusion.</p>
      <p>Parties then moved bracket-by-bracket through the text, discussing paragraphs under framing of the work, vulnerability and ability to respond to the impacts of potential consequences, and deepening understanding. SHARED VISION (AWG-LCA): During morning informal consultations, parties discussed whether to use non-paper No.</p>
      <p>33, resulting from the discussions in Bangkok, or No.</p>
      <p>43 from Barcelona, as the basis for negotiations.</p>
      <p>Several parties said their earlier proposals were not reflected in the non-papers.</p>
      <p>Informal consultations continued in the afternoon. MITIGATION (AWG-LCA): In the afternoon informal consultations on mitigation, parties commented on issues not addressed by drafting groups such as: mitigation by developed countries, market-based mechanisms, autonomous measures by developing countries, and maritime and aviation emissions.</p>
      <p>Developing countries said drafting work should begin on sub-paragraph 1(b)(i) of the BAP as soon as possible, suggesting comparability of efforts as a starting point.</p>
      <p>Some countries proposed focusing on targets.</p>
      <p>A party underlined the importance of developed country mitigation in line with science and in a legally-binding form.</p>
      <p>Several developing countries stressed that bunker fuels should be addressed under the Protocol.</p>
      <p>Some developed countries proposed also discussing common mitigation frameworks contained in non-paper No.</p>
      <p>A drafting group on mitigation by developed countries will be launched and bilateral consultations will be conducted on bunker fuels and on market-based approaches.</p>

      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Much of the buzz in the corridors on Tuesday afternoon and evening was focused on the Danish text for a political Copenhagen Agreement under the UNFCCC, which was leaked publicly by the UK s Guardian newspaper.</p>
      <p>The initial reaction by many parties and observers was excitement as rumors about the secret Danish text were finally confirmed.</p>
      <p>Many therefore rushed to download or print out the document and study it.</p>
      <p>Some developing country delegates seemed angry at what they characterized as a secretive and non-transparent initiative.</p>
      <p>This would amount to hijacking the high-level segment and giving our leaders the impression that we have done nothing the whole year, alleged one developing country delegate.</p>
      <p>However, most veterans and observers close to the process were more interested in knowing which version of the text was leaked, and whether it was in fact the document they had already seen in November.</p>
      <p>Some changes, but nothing earth-shattering, commented a veteran developing country negotiator when shown the so-called new leaked version.</p>
      <p>Reactions to the implications of the leak and the substance varied.</p>
      <p>Now it is all out in the open all the sensitive issues, everything.</p>
      <p>Maybe it will end up having a positive impact now that everyone has seen the text early on, was a comment that summed up some participants views.</p>
      <p>However, others expressed outrage about what they saw as weakness in terms of substance and legal form: A political agreement with little substance, for instance, no range for developed countries emission reductions in the text on a global long-term goal, is not strong enough, commented one observer.</p>
      <p>Others began speculating about how many more texts would be tabled during the Conference as rumors spread that several negotiating groups and ad hoc coalitions were in the process of drafting their own texts.</p>
      <p>I m aware of four different initiatives, confessed an insider, And the last thing we want is a beauty contest over competing texts.</p>
      <p>I wonder if we ll end up with the COP Presidency tabling a take it or leave it text at some point?</p>
      <p>asked one participant.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, some delegates were also discussing news that the US Environmental Protection Agency would be able to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act since they were now considered a threat to health.</p>
      <p>Some were speculating whether this might affect the US level of ambition.</p>
      <p>At a minimum it provides needed momentum and might provide flexibility in the US negotiating position, opined one civil society participant.</p>
      <p>However, others suggested that increased ambition is unlikely without concrete action by the US Congress.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12450e_3">
      <h2>Fourth review of the financial mechanism</h2>
      <p>The Secretariat introduced the issue ( FCCC/SBI/2009/Misc.10 ).</p>
      <p>The G-77/CHINA said the fourth review provides an opportunity to look at gaps in implementation of obligations in a comprehensive manner.</p>
      <p>The LDCs emphasized dissatisfaction with implementation of the LDC work programme, stressing that funding should not be restricted to NAPAs.</p>
      <p>CHINA said developed countries must significantly increase their contributions to the fifth replenishment and reform the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to improve its capacity to facilitate implementation post-2012.</p>
      <p>The EU welcomed review and guidance ahead of the conclusion of the fifth replenishment, noting the review should provide the basis for progressively defining the role of the GEF in the architecture being defined under the AWG-LCA.</p>

      <h2>Report of the GEF</h2>
      <p>The Secretariat introduced this item ( FCCC/CP/2009/9 ) and the GEF presented on its report.</p>
      <p>Highlighting the US$ 2.7 billion already invested in mitigation, GEF Chair Monique Barbut emphasized GEF reform around four focal points: response to Convention guidance; country ownership; effectiveness and efficiency; and the fifth replenishment. SWITZERLAND supported the GEF s role as the operating entity of the financial mechanism and as a catalyst for leveraging finance, noting that it was crucial to improve performance.</p>
      <p>Algeria, for the AFRICAN GROUP, said GEF reforms are encouraging but inadequate, noting the need to strengthen urgent priorities for beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>BARBADOS acknowledged ongoing work to improve the GEF resource allocation framework and called for a strong fifth replenishment. BENIN highlighted the need for closer linkages between the GEF focal points and the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>Noting positive GEF reforms resulting in increased access to funds for LDCs, the GAMBIA expressed hope that the fifth replenishment would enhance funding under the LDC Fund.</p>
      <p>SYRIA called for a reconsideration of financial resource allocation, particularly for adaptation projects.</p>
      <p>Sudan, for the G-77/CHINA, highlighted concerns relating to predictability and adequacy of funding.</p>
      <p>With MALI, RWANDA, ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA, and TIMOR-LESTE, she opposed the co-financing requirement, which she said is particularly burdensome for LDCs.</p>
      <p>UGANDA supported monitoring and evaluation of implementing agencies.</p>
