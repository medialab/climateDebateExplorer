      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>Delegates emerged from the final plenary of the subsidiary bodies on Wednesday evening with seemingly mixed feelings.</p>
      <p>Most appeared to feel that the AWGs and SBs had achieved at least the minimum that was needed.</p>
      <p>We got what we came here for, although many might have wanted more, said one delegate.</p>
      <p>There were some small wins here but no big breakthroughs.</p>
      <p>Still, few expected any, said another.</p>
      <p>Some were pleasantly surprised that the AWG-KP had finished its work at a reasonable hour, especially since some sections of the work programme had apparently not been agreed when the text was brought to plenary.</p>
      <p>There was a range of views on the work programme in particular, depending on which delegation was speaking.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in some of the remaining COP/MOP negotiations, the Article 9 review group was reporting slow progress at 11:00 pm Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>However, delegates leaving the Adaptation Fund talks at a similar hour were reporting some forward momentum, with the legal status of the Board as the only major outstanding issue.</p>
