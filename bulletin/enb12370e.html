      <h2>WORKSHOP ON METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES:</h2>
      <small>working group</small>
      <p>The Secretariat introduced relevant methodologies under the Convention and Protocol, and provided background information on global warming potentials (GWPs).</p>
      <p>Simon Eggleston, IPCC, presented on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, detailing changes compared with the previous guidelines.</p>
      <p>Venkatachalam Ramaswamy, IPCC, described complexities of GWP estimates and outlined potential alternative metrics.</p>
      <p>Responding to concerns raised on the managed land proxy to account for anthropogenic changes in carbon stocks, Eggleston reported that the task force on inventories is proposing considering new scientific input on this at the next IPCC plenary.</p>
      <p>On reporting experiences, NEW ZEALAND, the EU, NORWAY, CANADA and SWITZERLAND supported using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines during the second commitment period, but said further methodological work may be necessary.</p>
      <p>CHINA underscored potential problems resulting from a change in reporting methodologies. BRAZIL highlighted shortcomings of GWPs, stating that they overestimate the impact of methane.</p>
      <p>The EU and NORWAY supported the use of GWPs, with the EU highlighting the GWP approach as the most suitable for converting emissions to a common equivalent unit.</p>
      <p>NEW ZEALAND underscored the impact of GWPs on mitigation potential.</p>
      <p>He called for consistent treatment of GWPs, stressing that they are also relevant for the AWG-LCA s work on MRV and mitigation potential.</p>
      <p>AWG Vice-Chair Konate said his summary of the discussions will be available Monday.</p>

      <p>Following consultations on Friday, a draft text on possible improvements to the flexible mechanisms was made available Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The document lists possible improvements to the scope, effectiveness and efficiency, accessibility, contribution to sustainable development, capacity to generate co-benefits, and transfer of technology under each of the three mechanisms.</p>
      <p>A contact group is convening Monday morning.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12370e_11">
      <h2>NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS (SBI):</h2>

    </div>
    <div id="section_enb12370e_12">
      <h2>OTHER ISSUES (AWG-KP):</h2>
      <p>In the contact group, SAUDI ARABIA and KUWAIT opposed discussing international aviation and maritime emissions, stressing IMO and ICAO as the right fora.</p>
      <p>Stressing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, INDIA supported discussing this issue under the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>With BRAZIL, he expressed concerns over the issue becoming a sectoral approach.</p>
      <p>The EU, CANADA, NORWAY and NEW ZEALAND called for a comprehensive global approach to these emissions. CANADA expressed a preference for discussing the issue under the AWG-LCA, and AUSTRALIA emphasized that the focus in the AWG-KP must be on Annex I domestic emissions.</p>
      <p>BRAZIL, CHINA and SOUTH AFRICA stressed that there are no links between AWG-KP and AWG-LCA. JAPAN said the issue was complex and the expertise of IMO and ICAO was needed.</p>
      <p>The EU recognized IMO s and ICAO s technical competence but said the UNFCCC should show leadership.</p>
      <p>MICRONESIA and TUVALU stressed the aviation and maritime sectors potential for generating revenue for adaptation.</p>
      <p>AWG Chair Dovland noted lack of consensus and said he would consider how to proceed. AWG Chair Dovland said the message from the methodological workshop was to continue using GWPs and the basket of gases.</p>
      <p>BRAZIL highlighted problems with GWPs, and NEW ZEALAND said they would be open to considering other methods.</p>
      <p>Dovland said the GWP issue would be reconsidered in Ghana.</p>
      <p>Informal consultations will continue on Monday evening.</p>

      <h2>REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM DEFORESTATION (SBSTA):</h2>
      <p>In informal consultations, delegates discussed Co-Chairs draft conclusions, focusing on the main elements of outstanding methodological issues.</p>
      <p>Many parties stressed the need for less prescriptive text, with others expressing concern that including specific options at this stage would prejudice outcomes.</p>

      <small>corridors</small>
      <p>The mood of delegates ranged from relaxed to disgruntled on Saturday, largely depending on which meeting or group they attended.</p>
      <p>While there were smiles on the faces of those in discussions on capacity building or on research and systematic observation, for instance, those working on adaptation and the financial mechanism seemed less satisfied.</p>
      <p>Some delegates were talking about mandate issues - in particular, what track or body was the most appropriate for certain topics relevant to the post-2012 negotiations.</p>
      <p>Several noted different views on where to have discussions on international aviation and maritime emissions.</p>
      <p>A few experienced negotiators were noting some changes in attitude on this issue, not only in terms of where it should be discussed under the UNFCCC process, but also in terms of the competence of the UNFCCC vis-Ã  vis external bodies.</p>
      <p>Many seemed excited at the prospect of some time off, with no formal negotiations booked between Saturday evening and Monday morning.</p>
      <p>First, I ll go to the NGO party, then on Sunday I ll relax and watch one of the Euro 2008 games, said a smiling delegate, referring to Europe s biggest football (soccer) tournament, which started this weekend.</p>
