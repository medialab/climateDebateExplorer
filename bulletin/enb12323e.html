      <h2>IN THE CORRIDORS</h2>
      <small>SBI/SBSTA — corridors</small>
      <p>Delegates were reflecting on a low-key first day on Monday evening, with several referring to it as business as usual.</p>
      <p>A few seemed optimistic about making progress on the Adaptation Fund at SB 26, while several were looking forward to more substantive discussions in the AWG later in the session.</p>
      <p>A couple of participants also commented on the prompt 6:00 pm finish, noting that SBI even beat its deadline by finishing earlier.</p>
      <p>I could get used to this, joked one.</p>
      <p>Looking outside the Bonn talks, a few delegates were commenting on the parallel CSD meeting in New York and WMO Congress in Geneva, which appear to have thinned out the ranks of negotiators and experts here in Bonn.</p>
      <p>Most delegates seemed to have modest expectations for SB 26, noting that this meeting is only part of the process, along with the G8, Vienna meetings, and others, that will contribute in the lead-up to Bali.</p>
      <p>We're not expecting much here, so no one should be disappointed, commented one observer.</p>
      <p>But, exciting times lie ahead over the coming months, he added.</p>

      <p>Germany, for the EU, stated the EU's commitment to cut emissions by 30% by 2020 compared with 1990 levels if other developed countries follow suit and economically advanced developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities.</p>
      <p>She urged extending the carbon market, addressing emissions from international aviation and maritime transportation, and progress on the Adaptation Fund and budget.</p>
      <p>Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, highlighted the Adaptation Fund, Russian proposal, and AWG.</p>
      <p>Nigeria, for the AFRICAN GROUP, called for better geographic distribution of CDM projects and more support for non-Annex I communications.</p>
