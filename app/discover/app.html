    <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand? Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

            <p>The diagram shows the evolution of the visibility of the most engaged negotiation groupings. Each line shows the percentage of ENB sections in which the name of the corresponding group is mentioned (over the total of ENB sections for the year).</p>

            <h2>The protagonists</h2>
            <p>Three groupings are consistently among the most visible actors of the negotiation: the European Union, the Group of 77 and China and the Alliance of Small Island. The engagement of this last group is particularly interesting, as it is derives directly from the particular vulnerability of this States to climate change.</p>

            <h2>On the rise</h2>
            <p>The diagram shows the increasing engagement of the countries of the South of the World, in particular the African group and the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as of the transversal Environmental Integrity Group.</p>

            <h2>The peak after Kyoto</h2>
            <p>A clear pick is visible in many lines in the year 1998 (particurly of the EU and the G77 and China). It is not easy to interpret this peak taking place right after the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol: it may corresponds to the efforts of some negotiation groupings to encourage the implementation of the Protocol, but it may also derives from a change in the way the ENB reports on the negotiation.</p>
